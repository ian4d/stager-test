    "You see, the power structure that we\u0027re rebelling against is the American government. We see them misleading the whole world down a corporate dead end into neomodernism. They\u0027re leaving no space for society to develop. We believe we need to return to Shamanism or return to magic or return to values of the earth, an understanding that was held by most ethnic people. So we see our source of inspiration as being the ethnic peoples that the corporate world hasn\u0027t yet [BLEEP] up.",
    "We have a very good rapport with them. When we go to town, they all wave at us. And they\u0027re friendly."
