    "In terms of the relationship between my sister and me, this is probably completely really sick. But I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it\u0027s very easy to demonstrate those feelings. It\u0027s not as easy to demonstrate those feelings toward my sister, just because we never got in the habit of it.",
    "Well, the really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Duki. But I think kind of a big chunk. It definitely gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn\u0027t have otherwise.",
    "Fish.",
    "Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about eight and I was about 10. And when he first arrived he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. And he had a cape on and black kind of villain/hero goggles. I guess we\u0027d call it hero goggles. And I think he was, because there was an S on his cape, I\u0027m sure he was supposed to be Superduck or something.",
    "And he\u0027s a puppet. He lost the outfit pretty quickly, and he went naked. And then he became Ashley\u0027s vehicle for torturing me.",
    "Whenever Ashley brought Duki into the equation, he was completely the dominant force. I was just putty in Duki\u0027s hands.",
    "Ashley\u0027s very considerate. She\u0027s very considerate and kind and thoughtful, and very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very concerned about if other people are happy or if someone else doesn\u0027t feel good. And Duki has this total \"What\u0027s for lunch?\" attitude, like \"What\u0027s in it for me?\" in your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.",
    "He\u0027s just this indomitable spirit. Well, lately, he\u0027s at U Mich with my sister. And he tried out for the football team. They\u0027ve got a good football team there.",
    "And he said he didn\u0027t make it. But he said it was because they thought he\u0027d be more valuable in the band. And they got a good band, too. So apparently, he goes to band practice every day.",
    "And they\u0027ve got him playing the triangle. He\u0027s playing the triangle in the band. And he couldn\u0027t come home for Thanksgiving because he had to go be at practice.",
    "Fish.",
    "What he looks like, physical-- he\u0027s like a slightly pathetic-looking grey, tattered thing.",
    "Very tattered. But then the fact that his brain, like what\u0027s coming out of his mouth, is in complete denial about who he actually is. I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s just something really, really great about that. And really, you have to love-- you love him for it.",
    "I adore Duki. I really love Duki. And sometimes I think if he disappeared, it would really feel like someone died. I mean, I look at him and he looks really old and ratty. And it really makes me sad.",
    "Really, I feel like-- it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki, and that it would be a big, empty hole in the world. He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking.",
    "Fish.",
    "It freaks Duki out.",
    "I think he knows. I think he\u0027s in denial about it. He\u0027s in denial about most things. He\u0027s in denial about the fact that he\u0027s totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he\u0027s really good-looking and strong, and that he\u0027s really smart and has a lot of friends.",
    "He\u0027s in denial about the fact that he\u0027s actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him that. I say, \"Duki, give me a break. You\u0027re just stuffed.\" And he\u0027s like, \"No way.\"",
    "Yona Lu, yeah. I think she\u0027s acting as his agent.",
    "She\u0027s a hedgehog.",
    "Fish.",
    "I don\u0027t know. She\u0027s drives a pretty hard bargain.",
    "I just want a real person who\u0027s like Duki, probably. I want to go marry some guy who\u0027s like Duki.",
    "Not well.",
    "Ira?",
    "Don\u0027t make me sound like an idiot, OK?"
