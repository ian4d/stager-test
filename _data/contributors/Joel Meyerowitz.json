  "name": "Joel Meyerowitz",
  "episodes": {},
  "statements": [
    "You\u0027re getting closer, Pop. Just try. Try to think about what Rick does.",
    "Right! You got it.",
    "You got it right. And I\u0027m Joel. What do I do?",
    "I know. Come on. Get serious, Pop. Do you remember what it is I do? What do I do?",
    "What\u0027s my profession?",
    "What\u0027s my profession?",
    "What\u0027s my profession?",
    "OK, what about Stevie? What\u0027s Stevie\u0027s business?",
    "Stevie.",
    "Does it bother you that you can\u0027t remember your kids\u0027 names sometimes and you can\u0027t remember what they do?",
    "I was visiting my father. We were driving someplace and he was babbling on, as he does. His great skill is that he can talk. And in the middle of one of these riffs, he turned to me with a look of panic, really, and he said, \"The trouble with me is I never get to the point where I get to the point.\" And that was so pungent an observation about his predicament that it entered my consciousness in a way that made me say, now. That\u0027s it. I\u0027m going to make a film about him. He\u0027s at a place in this disease where, before he\u0027s completely gone and while he has some consciousness about his situation, I\u0027m going to take him out into the world again and see what happens to him and how he handles himself.",
    "Honestly, it\u0027s sad. I have a feeling of sadness, but I also have a feeling of acceptance. We\u0027ve been apart for 20 years in the mutual prime of our lives when I was raising my children and he was a grandparent. We weren\u0027t together.",
    "And so I guess I\u0027m just accepting of where he is. If we had been together for 20 years and I had seen the decline and I had been relating to him emotionally and lovingly all that time, I might feel a deeper sadness. But even though he\u0027s my father, the distance that we\u0027ve been apart all these years has put some kind of a buffer in there. So this is the guy that I know now.",
    "We have a much closer relationship, the way we see each other and talk to each other and have continuity.",
    "A hero fall.",
    "Well, he was my hero. My childhood hero. But that\u0027s so far away, I can\u0027t relate to the sadness of that. I love him in that unequivocal way that a child loves a parent. And I feel when I care for him a kind of renewal or a rebirth of feeling in this period.",
    "I know when I take him after a shower and I rub him down, I actually feel his head in my hands and I feel his flesh in my hands. It\u0027s been many years since I had that kind of contact with my father. And it was a little strange at first. I thought, \"What\u0027s it like to rub this other person\u0027s body? Touch this other person\u0027s body?\" It\u0027s like deference. And then I realize it\u0027s my Pop. And he\u0027s in need. He can\u0027t take care of himself this way.",
    "Mom? OK, here\u0027s Papa, Mom. Hold on. OK, here comes Dad.",
    "I think my father had a classic marriage of his generation. He loved my mother. She was beautiful and hot tempered, an exciting person to be with. But he wanted something from her that either he didn\u0027t know how to get or she couldn\u0027t give. And that was a kind of mother-love that he himself hadn\u0027t experienced.",
    "His mother had been bed-ridden after his birth. And then she died soon after. So he never really knew her. That\u0027s the deepest groove in his memory, which is, I think, unrequited love.",
    "And I think from my point of view now that if he had really just loved my mother without demanding something from her, or needing something from her, which was that childhood need, that she probably would have just loved him back for the kind, warm, funny man that he was. But because there was something that he was demanding, she couldn\u0027t give it to him. A kind of perverse logic of relationship occurred.",
    "Why is she mad?",
    "Well, she probably was caring a lot--",
    "Do you know what ocean this is?",
    "--which is why she was mad. That we didn\u0027t call.",
    "But you\u0027re having such a good time here.",
    "Throughout the trip, he asked for Sally every single day-- \"Where\u0027s Sally? Where\u0027s Mom?\"-- thinking that she should have been in the car next to him.",
    "Yeah, Pop. We said goodbye to Mom.",
    "It\u0027s your pillow. That pillow\u0027s going to have to be your Sally--",
    "--for at least two weeks now.",
    "Nope. That\u0027s your pillow, Pop.",
    "The swiftest!",
    "The Catskills are mountains. This is an ocean. Which one?",
    "There was a time when we were driving with her in Florida, before we made the film. And she was sitting right next to him. And he leaned over to me and he said, \"Where\u0027s Mom?\" And I said, \"Well, who\u0027s sitting next to you?\" And he looked over at this person sitting next to him. He said, \"Where\u0027s Sally? That\u0027s not Sally.\"",
    "Good morning.",
    "Good morning, Pop.",
    "How are you doing?",
    "His real intelligence is to live in the moment. He knew where he was and he was just enjoying the experience. But he couldn\u0027t really look back at what he had done even an hour before and remember it. And I tested him all the time, because I wanted to see if stimulation could actually enliven his mentality and bring him back at all. But that was sort of a hopeless hope. But it didn\u0027t stop me from having it anyway.",
    "I just want to review a few things with you. I have a few questions for you.",
    "No.",
    "Do you remember any of the things on the trip so far?",
    "Why?",
    "Is it the Pacific or the Atlantic?",
    "It\u0027s gone.",
    "To moil?",
    "To moil?",
    "No, you can do this without glasses.",
    "\"Ark.\"",
    "OK, now read it again. And for the first sentence, \"respect the old man who has forgotten.\" Just read it that way.",
    "OK, now read it-- do you want my glasses?",
    "Read it one more time. At the end say, \"the Talmud.\" Because it says--",
    "It says it comes from the Talmud. \"Respect the old man who has forgotten what he has learned.\" Come to a rest. OK? Ready? Read.",
    "Really?",
    "We don\u0027t have your glasses here, Dad.",
    "You don\u0027t need your glasses. You read it perfectly without your glasses.",
    "Just do it one more time.",
    "Yeah. Put these glasses on and just see if they help you to read it.",
    "Maybe so. One last time. This is it. This is your chance.",
    "Otherwise you don\u0027t get the job.",
    "This is a casting session.",
    "You\u0027ve got enough light there, Pop. All you\u0027ve got to do is try to read it.",
    "(SUBJECT) HY MEYEROWITZ: Yeah. I know I-- where is my-- didn\u0027t I bring my glasses up?",
    "I don\u0027t know. They\u0027re away somewhere in a bag.",
    "Wrong?",
    "Ready? Here goes. This is your screen test.",
    "Take 11 for Hy Meyerowitz reading from \"The Forgotten.\"",
    "Dad, this is-- no, no. Read that. No, no. This is a joke, Pop. Read those few words there. And then with the words \"the Talmud.\" Nice and slow, take this one.",
    "OK.",
    "I guess as a legitimate actor, you would have a hard time reading your lines. But as a comic actor, you can deliver your lines flawlessly--",
    "--without even having to read anything.",
    "Your career as a Talmudian actor--",
    "--is kaput! You\u0027re finished. Out! Next! Bring in the next old man.",
    "What was it that you liked about Charlie Chaplin that made you want to do the Charlie Chaplin act?",
    "So which one is it then?",
    "Did you feel connected to him in that way?",
    "Aw--",
    "Oh, Papa. Well, your boys saw you. We all saw you. I loved when you were the strong man in the neighborhood. I loved when you were the Chaplin figure and the comic. I loved the way you drove the car. You were such a great driver.",
    "I love the way you talk to people. You could talk to the big guys or the little guys, and you made them all the same, Pop. I used to think of you as the great equalizer. You could take a guy who was a doctor or a principal of the school or a business man, and you can take another guy who was just an ordinary worker, and you would treat them the same. And you would bring them all to the same level, and that would be the level of laughter.",
    "That\u0027s right.",
    "The Permishic. Right.",
    "The Farshimmelt. The Farshimmelt Ocean.",
    "Where were you born?",
    "Well, it was East 100th Street, right?",
    "He taught me all the street-smart things. He set up a punching bag for me. And he taught me how to fight, how to take my stance, how to throw a punch, how to put your body behind it. He had me work out on a light bag too, like this. He always felt that if you got into a scrape in the neighborhood that you shouldn\u0027t run away. His motto was, \"Step in and deliver the first blow.\" And he said, \"Take the biggest guy down.\"",
    "And that was his attitude. He wouldn\u0027t stop and run away from anything. On Morrison Avenue, the block we lived on, he was considered the mayor of the block. Anytime there was a dispute that had to be settled, they would actually come and ask him, \"What do you think, Hy?\" Or if there were strangers coming through the neighborhood and they needed to be told to get out of there, they\u0027d get him. And the scenes I remember of it, people would gather in front of our window, and they\u0027d yell, \"Hymie? Hey, Hymie?\" And he\u0027d come to the window and he would adjudicate from the window. He would say, \"No, no. You shouldn\u0027t do that. And he should do this. And you get that. Let him alone.\" And it was like The Judge.",
    "Hey, Pop?",
    "You know what this reminds me of?",
    "Does that remind you of Melvin?",
    "That\u0027s what I was thinking.",
    "Do you remember Melvin?",
    "What was Melvin?",
    "A parakeet.",
    "Do you remember the things that Melvin said?",
    "Yeah, but how did he say it? Do you remember?",
    "No, he said, \"I\u0027m Melvin--\" what?",
    "\"I\u0027m Melvin Meyerowitz.\"",
    "Can you tell me the story of the time he got lost--",
    "Pop, remember how he used to say \"My name is Melvin Meyerowitz. I\u0027m a Jewish bird.\"",
    "That comes back to you?",
    "\"Good morning, Dr. Goldberg.\"",
    "Whenever Dr. Goldberg came to visit Mom when she was sick?",
    "And do you remember the time the bird flew away across the Bronx? He went out the door on Mom\u0027s shoulder and he flew away. And we were all so heartbroken that the bird was gone. And then some woman called up. Do you remember? She called mom, and she said, \"Do you have a bird named Melvin?\" My mother said, \"Yeah, we have a bird. It was a green and yellow parakeet.\" And the woman said, \"Well, the bird landed on my window and said, \u0027My name is Melvin Meyerowitz. I\u0027m a Jewish bird.\u0027 And I looked you up in the phone book, and I called the Meyerowitz\u0027s, and they said, \u0027No, no. That\u0027s my brother Hy\u0027s bird.\u0027\" We went and we got the bird back. Do you remember that?",
    "I\u0027m surprised.",
    "With the onset of memory loss, it\u0027s not only his memories that are fading away, but it\u0027s the memories that I shared with him that are fading away. So I could no longer say to him, \"Hey Pop, remember we did this?\" And have him say, \"Yes, that was fantastic. Remember it?\" So I found myself progressively left alone with my memories. And then you look at your own memories and you realize, I got this handful of really insignificant things, and I\u0027ve made them my world, my world of memory.",
    "And it\u0027s astonishing how the few things that I recall to share with him are minor notes. The bird or the handful of things that I ask him. So that was really-- that was a lesson for me about what it is that rises up out of our experience that we hold onto.",
    "Pop.",
    "I want to ask you a few questions about the family.",
    "About our family.",
    "You\u0027ve got three sons.",
    "What are their names?",
    "And who\u0027s your youngest son?",
    "Joel, Rick, and--?",
    "Stevie.",
    "OK. Do you know what Rick does to make a living? what his career is?",
    "What\u0027s he famous for?",
    "So you don\u0027t remember what Rick does?",
    "Next! Bring in the next old man."
