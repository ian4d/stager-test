    "It could have been anything.",
    "Who knows? Who knows? But there have been quite a few dancers that have been found in different areas.",
    "Of course. Yeah, you hear about it. In the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] magazine or in the newspaper. It\u0027s never played up. Because everybody thinks, a go-go dancer. Oh, she must be a slut or whatever. They\u0027re still people too, and whatever they do they do. But nobody deserves to be killed.",
    "It\u0027s jive cheerleading.",
    "It\u0027s not your good old cheerleader cheering.",
    "Definitely.",
    "My love, Joe. Hi. How are you doing? I hope I can get through this hell hole. I love you with all my heart and miss you very, very bad. I got four months, that\u0027s 102 days here in jail. Joe, if you love me like you say, will you wait for me, please? Whatever you do, don\u0027t leave me. Come see me on Saturday. Visiting hours, 2:00 to 4:00 PM.",
    "I heard you were here to see me, but I never seen you. What happened to you? Well, my love of my life, I won\u0027t be here too long. I\u0027m hurt because I never seen you in court with me. Calvin said you was here. I\u0027m trying to get a three-way phone so I can call you. If you can find someone with a three-way phone, please get the phone number and let me know. Well, Joe, this is just a little letter to let you know what\u0027s going on. When I get more paper, I\u0027ll write you more, longer letters. I love you, Joe, with all my heart. Miss you real bad. Forever your love, Debbie.",
    "Joe, Virginia said you don\u0027t want to talk to me so we are through with each other and I am getting abortion. I don\u0027t want your baby, so leave me alone. Love, Debbie.",
    "I experienced such a movement through, I don\u0027t know if it was my bloodstream or my soul."
