    "You know that saying, you can really tell who somebody is in a crisis? You can really tell at Christmas, too. That\u0027s because Christmas, more than any other day in the American year, is a day when we\u0027re all handed the same stage props. The same tree, the presents, the meal, the relatives, and all the same expectations. And then we all try to create, more or less, the same kind of day. It\u0027s like hundreds of millions of people all set to work doing exactly the same art project. And not just any art project, but a very high stakes art project, an art project everybody cares about getting right. And in that setting, the choices people make never seem clearer.",
    "They find a price sticker on the twins doll. And they stand there, unnerved.",
    "What are you looking at?",
    "It turns out to be $90.",
    "Who is it for?",
    "And one place you can witness this human drama at work is at one of the epicenters of modern Christmas, the world\u0027s biggest toy store, Toys R Us.",
    "How old is she?",
    "How come so last minute? The store closes in just two minutes.",
    "You\u0027re a good dad.",
    "This is the thing about Christmas. Christmas has given him a stage on which he can prove who he is. He\u0027s the same good dad he always is, but more so, you know? Christmas. Christmas is the time when everybody is who they normally are, but more so.",
    "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. If you are hearing our program for the first time, a number of public radio stations around the country are just picking us up for this Christmas special. We are a new public radio show. Each week we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers, performers, radio producers to tackle that theme with radio monologues, mini documentaries, overheard conversations, found tape, anything we can think of.",
    "Today\u0027s program in three acts. Act One, Toys R Us. Act Two, David Sedaris\u0027 \"SantaLand Diaries.\" Act Three, Christmas Freud. That\u0027s Sigmund Freud. Stay with us.",
    "Closing time, Christmas Eve. But still the store is filled with parents making one last run to the goal line of a perfect Christmas. Mark [? Neimus ?] and his teenage son Ricky are walking the length of the store. Walking, literally, as quickly as men can walk without actually breaking into a run. Their bodies are tense. They spot a sales girl.",
    "They\u0027re directed into aisle 12C. It is stacked high with dolls. The [? Neimus ?] boys don\u0027t have much time. Where are the twin dolls? There\u0027s Heart to Heart Baby, whose heart really beats. There is poseable Sleepy Soft Skin. There is Softina, the miracle soft foam doll. There is Baby Bathe-A-Lot. There\u0027s Danielle\u0027s Fashion Ensemble. There\u0027s Baby Braids, the pretty, huggable, fashion hair doll. There is Baby Tummy Talks.",
    "Well, no. Actually, they\u0027re not. A middle aged black couple, themselves in the search for a doll called the Sparkle doll, suggests 11C.",
    "All the dolls in 11C, for some reason, have names that suggest the names of starlets in adult films. So Shy Sherry, Baby Shivers, Powder Pool twins, Previous Playmate. Debbie Attachable Accessories. Standing there, I realize, of course their names are like names from adult films. Where else do you find this kind of hyped up, packaged, theatrical girlishness?",
    "David Sedaris\u0027 \"SantaLand Diaries\" are published in his book Barrel Fever. His forthcoming book of stories is called Naked.",
    "Act Two.",
    "Four Christmases ago, those were the words which introduced radio listeners across the country to David Sedaris. His account of working as a department store elf for two Christmas seasons was immediately one of the most popular stories ever broadcast on National Public Radio\u0027s Morning Edition. Only the coverage of commentator Red Barber\u0027s death generated more tape requests, I have been told. It is with pleasure that we broadcast it again today. The Morning Edition version of \"The SantaLand Diaries\" ran only eight and a half minutes because of the format of Morning Edition. But here, here we have the time to stretch out, and play you something that\u0027s much closer to David\u0027s original text.",
    "More of David Sedaris\u0027 \"SantaLand Diaries\" and Christmas Freud, in a minute, when our program continues.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. The special Christmas edition of our program. We continue with David Sedaris\u0027 \"SantaLand Diaries.\"",
    "Act Three, Christmas Freud. Well, on the Upper East Side of New York City, the upscale department store Barney\u0027s has chosen an odd tactic for its Christmas decorations. Namely, they don\u0027t refer to Christmas. It\u0027s like an odd-- you know, you\u0027ve got to respect that kind of contrarian streak. Instead, each of their department store windows is dedicated to different famous people of the twentieth century, filled with memorabilia, pictures, video monitors, all sorts of images and colors and lights. The subjects of the windows? Frank Sinatra, the beat poets, great blonds of the 20th century, Martin Luther King, and Sigmund Freud.",
    "Only one of these windows has a live human being in it, and it\u0027s the Freud window. The human being is a 30-ish bearded actor named David Rakoff.",
    "You know, I think we have time for one more act.",
    "It\u0027s 1966. John\u0027s family taped everything, all the time, he says, including this Christmas when he was three.",
    "John is John Connors, a Chicago DJ. He provides a lot of the music for This American Life from his vast and strange record collection. And on this, the third Christmas of his life, he is given exactly the present that he asked for, a close and play record player. This is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. John\u0027s mother pulls out her camera to take a picture of him with his presents.",
    "It deteriorates from there.",
    "This right here? This is what Christmas is all about. Everybody\u0027s posed, everybody\u0027s ready, everybody\u0027s straining to be happy, and everybody has this picture in their heads of the perfect Christmas. And of course, it is never going to be perfect. It\u0027s never going to live up to that picture. And so disappointment is built into the very structure of the day.",
    "And so the best you can hope for on Christmas-- and I say this as a Jew, somebody who has never celebrated the holiday, which makes me an outside observer, an impartial observer-- the best you can do is to ride the imperfections, hope they don\u0027t overtake everybody.",
    "In this tape from 1966, John\u0027s parents spent a lot of time trying to keep him from destroying a new train set the very first day he gets it.",
    "Three-year-old John runs the train so fast, it always crashes.",
    "All day long, a perfect day wavers in and out of focus, for a while wobbling towards disaster. Broken toys, hurt feelings, disappointment, and listing back towards happiness. Our three-year-old DJ puts a 45 of \"Winchester Cathedral\" in his new record player and runs the trains as fast as he can.",

    "I\u0027m Ira Glass, back next week with more stories of This American Life.",
    "What\u0027s it take to put the past behind us? What\u0027s it take for a whole country to do it? Consider this story. After World War II, the Nuremberg trials documented German war crime atrocities and the Holocaust. But Germans didn\u0027t accept it. Historians have noted that, as far as the Germans were concerned, Nuremberg wasn\u0027t real justice. It was just a bunch of outsiders coming in after the war, imposing victor\u0027s justice.",
    "It wasn\u0027t until the 1960s, when the Germans held their own homegrown war crimes trials, that the Germans were forced to face what they\u0027d done as a nation during the war. And even that wasn\u0027t enough. As one writer put it, it took an accumulation of a million school visits to concentration camps, 1,000 books, the Hollywood television series, Holocaust, a vast molecular reckoning between generations that\u0027s still going on.",
    "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, how to come to peace with the past, stories of people running toward and running from the truth and shame. Act One, International Justice, an entire nation coming to grips with the past--or actually, not coming to grips with the past. Act Two, Juvenile Justice, criminals face their past-- juvenile criminals. We have a report from Scott Carrier. Act Three, Everyday Justice, ordinary New Yorkers confessing their sins, quietly, in public. Stay with us.",
    "Act One. Well, ever since the end of World War II, there\u0027s been this idealistic notion kicking around that when nations do horrible things, the best way to deal with it, to put those things to rest, would be to have a court somewhere, a court for war crimes, for crimes against humanity. And now, for the first time since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of World War II, a court like this is actually in session. This is the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.",
    "Just like the Nuremberg trials, this is justice administered by outsiders. These trials are happening far from the Balkans. They\u0027re in the Hague, in the Netherlands. There are lawyers and judges from Egypt, and France, and Sri Lanka, and Canada, and lots of Americans there. Kitty Felde is a familiar voice to public radio listeners for her coverage of the O. J. Simpson trial and the Rodney King beating trial, but over the course of the last year, she spent several weeks in the Hague, watching this new form of justice take place.",
    "That story by Kitty Felde. There\u0027s this remarkable essay about war crimes trials and national truth commissions by Michael Ignatieff, in the current issue of Index on Censorship. Ignatieff is writing a book on truth and national reconciliation, and he\u0027s examining the war crimes trial in the Hague, and the one in Rwanda, and the truth commissions in Argentina, and Chile, and South Africa, the situation in Ireland. And in this essay, he writes, \"It\u0027s open to question whether justice or truth actually heals. For one thing,\" he says, \"what you see as the truth depends on who you are.\"",
    "He tells this story. In June of 1996, he was asked to chair a discussion of historians from Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia. And all of these had been people who had opposed the war. Most of them, in fact, had been close friends before the war. And they hadn\u0027t given in to the national hatreds inflamed by the war. They\u0027d remained friends. It was about 30 people.",
    "So what do you make of this notion of the Americans and the other foreigners who are holding the tribunal that, OK, we\u0027re going to get at the truth?",
    "Right, but it\u0027s just a first step.",
    "It\u0027s such an interesting contrast to a place like South Africa where, as you point out in your essay, you have former adversaries actually sitting down trying to create a government, trying to create a nation where all sides are represented. And so when they sit down and hold a truth commission themselves, not outsiders but they, themselves, because they are ready to reconcile and have been part of a process of reconciliation, there\u0027s a place for that truth to go. It can actually have an effect. There\u0027s a readiness for it.",
    "In his essay, Michael Ignatieff raises this question. To come to terms with the past, do entire nations have to go through the same psychological processes that a person goes through when they face the past? In other words, does there have to be a moment of admitting the truth, of admitting guilt, of feeling shame? We look at a few of those moments, in a very different setting, in a minute, when our program continues.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you radio monologues, miniature documentaries, found tape, anything we can think of on that theme. Today\u0027s program, what puts the past to rest?",
    "We are at Act Two, kids. There\u0027s a program in Tucson, Arizona that says, basically, the reason teenagers do so badly in the juvenile justice system is that they\u0027re tried and convicted not by their peers-- that is, by other teenagers-- but by adults, outsiders. Scott Carrier visited a Tucson courtroom set up with the premise that teenagers would be tried and convicted by other teenagers.",
    "Act Three, Everyday Justice. Well, the impulse to confess, to admit the truth, to state your shame, is so important and so basic that, of course, people do not need a trial to make them do it. In 1980, a New Yorker named Allan Bridge set up a telephone line he called the Apology Line. People could call and confess to anything. They were recorded. And you could call and you could listen to other people\u0027s confessions recorded on the line.",
    "Over time, the whole thing turned into a little community of confession. People recorded messages responding to each other\u0027s apologies. Mr. Apology, Allan Bridge, would leave messages responding. And sometimes he would actually contact callers off the line. Here\u0027s some recordings from the line.",
    "The Apology Line doesn\u0027t exist anymore. Mr. Apology, Allan Bridge, died in August of 1995. When he did, the line was deluged with hundreds of messages from its regular callers, grieving. His wife Marissa says it was never clear what the Apology Line had meant to people. For years, people had used it to talk about all sorts of experiences.",
    "When he was alive, would you ever call the line, or be tempted to call the line?",
    "And you\u0027d apologize for stuff?",
    "What would you apologize for back then? Do you remember what you would say?",
    "And once you actually had a real relationship with him, you wouldn\u0027t call the line, and you didn\u0027t feel the need to ever?",
    "He died in this scuba accident where he was hit by a jet skier, who then fled the scene and wasn\u0027t caught. Have you thought about the kinds of people who would call the line, who used to call the line all the time, who had done bad things to other people, and hurt other people, and you know, then would flee the scene and nobody would ever know? Have you thought about those jet skiers in terms of that, in terms of the people who used to call the line?",
    "But you can imagine those people actually calling the line. If they would\u0027ve called the line, if the line had existed for them, what would\u0027ve happened? What would Mr. Apology have said if he were around to say it?",
    "Marissa Bridge, Mrs. Apology.",

    "Sure is. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life.",
    "Taming animals means basically teaching them to conform to the human world, teaching them human expectations. And with many of the animals that Samantha raises, it\u0027s possible to make them more human while they\u0027re little. But then, once they reach a certain age, their real animal nature kicks in. A baby cougar she was raising started stalking her friends, biting at their throats. The raccoons also go for the throat.",
    "What do we want from animals? To run her business, Samantha has had to figure this out. And at parties or corporate events, in commercials and films, Samantha has her raccoons pick pockets and play basketball. She has rats that bowl, rats that answer toy telephones.",
    "Do people want to see animals do animal things?",
    "Most of us, the only animals we ever see are animals who act like humans. You know, cats and dogs. We watch movies and TV shows and commercials that are filled with animals that fetch beers from the refrigerator and solve crimes. And we forget the sheer animal-ness of animals. We don\u0027t see it. Maybe we don\u0027t want to see it.",
    "Well, this brings us to the topic of today\u0027s program. From WBEZ, of course, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, The Animal-ness of Animals. Our show today in three acts.",
    "Act One, Staging the Food Chain in a New York Apartment. Act Two, Animal Court. That\u0027s an original radio play by David Sedaris. Act Three, The Moment Humans Stopped Being Animals That\u0027s a story by Scott Carrier. Stay with us.",
    "So when I heard that a woman named Samantha Martin had trained raccoons to play basketball and hires them out for parties and corporate events, I pictured raccoons in three-on-three or four-on-four games in little Chicago Bulls uniforms. Raccoon Scottie Pippen passes to raccoon Dennis Rodman. Raccoon Michael Jordan, you know, takes it in for a lay up or dunks it. The other team is a little raccoon Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. I could see it all. But that is not what it was like. No, no, no. That was naive.",
    "Samantha Martin chases after one of her two basketball-playing raccoons, holding a bag of blue and pink cotton candy. She alternates, actually between taking a fingerful of cotton candy for herself and giving one to the raccoon.",
    "Samantha\u0027s actually a skilled and successful trainer, but the animals are not cooperating this day, probably because Samantha went away for the holidays and they\u0027re still feeling neglected. Samantha puts a grapefruit-sized ball in the raccoon\u0027s hand and then pushes the raccoon\u0027s hand toward a Fisher-Price basketball net that rises perhaps a foot and a half off the floor.",
    "The fact is, there are things that raccoons like to do, are born to do. Playing basketball is not one of them.",
    "Paul Tough. Catherine Chalmers\u0027 pictures are in a book called Food Chain: Encounters Between Mates, Predators, and Prey.",
    "Coming up, animal radio theater by David Sedaris, animal research by Scott Carrier. That\u0027s all in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues.",
    "Act One. Usually when we see pictures of animals, they\u0027re fluffy and cute or they\u0027re noble and dignified. Well, compare that to this set of photos by Catherine Chalmers. In this first picture, we have a caterpillar eating a tomato-- a brightly-colored close-up of that. The second picture, a praying mantis eats the caterpillar. And in the third picture, a tarantula eats the praying mantis. Catherine Chalmers takes these pictures in her own apartment in New York City where she also raises the animals that she feeds to each other. Paul Tough stopped by for a visit.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a topic and tackle that topic with documentaries, short fiction, radio monologues, found tape, anything we can think of. Today\u0027s topic, Animals. Animals and the Animal-ness of Animals. We have arrived at Act Two of our program, which basically, it\u0027s more animals eating other animals.",
    "But first, a little story. A little girl is given a new sweater-- an ugly new sweater, which she hates. She takes the sweater, puts it on the floor, takes a nap, and when she wakes up, her sweater\u0027s been chewed to shreds. She, of course, could not be happier, but her mother\u0027s very upset, cries a little. The girl blames the dog. The dog. A little spaniel named Kathleen.",
    "Kathleen the spaniel then stood to proclaim.",
    "David Sedaris has written a play for our program. This play is an original radio play entirely in rhymed couplets. In this play, the animals do lots of things that humans do. For example, they talk. And they hold court out in the forest. But in this play, also, every now and then, unlike most fairy tales and like most movies about animals or stories about animals, these animals reassert their animal-ness.",
    "Our play begins as Kathleen the Spaniel heads out into the forest, and our narrator-- the little girl who owns her-- follows behind.",
    "The Pinetree Gang. Amy Sedaris, David Rakoff, Toby Wherry, Stacy Goldstein, Jackie Hoffman, [? Nora Ladonnie, ?] [? Sara Tyre, ?] and Richard Zaragoza. Story by David Sedaris.",
    "[MUSIC - \"ROCKY RACCOON\" BY LENA HORNE]",
    "Act Three, The Moment When Humans Stopped Being Animals. If you ask anthropologists, the moment that humans divide off from the animal kingdom is the moment that our ape-like ancestors started walking upright on two legs. For people who don\u0027t believe that God created the earth in six days, that moment is our origin.",
    "That\u0027s our Book of Genesis. That is the mythic point where we began. But nobody knows why these pre-humans started walking around on two legs instead of loping around on all fours the way that most animals do. There are different theories, but no consensus among scientists.",
    "10 years ago, Scott Carrier decided to do some research on his own, and he made this radio report.",
    "In the years since he first recorded that story, Scott has put it into a collection of his stories, a book called, simply, Running After Antelope.",

    "In movies and books, when somebody nearly dies it changes them. You know? They mend their ways. They treat people better. But in real life, it can go either way. Sandra waited and finally walked home alone, smelling like garbage, unrepentant.",
    "Yeah, knowing full well.",
    "But even after that you didn\u0027t quit the gang.",
    "What did you say?",
    "As if that\u0027s more heroic.",
    "But outrunning them is still just as fleeing.",
    "Well, from WBEZ Chicago it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, stories of people who thought they were about to die, and how it affected them or didn\u0027t affect them. Act One, the day after Kevin slept on the spot Jesus was crucified. Act Two, the day Lawrence left the AIDS clinic for the big road trip. Act Three, the day Claudia asked her brother some questions. Act Four, the day Cheryl got the news. Act Five, the day Matthew saw Brigid. Stay with us.",
    "The day Sandra should have been dead started like a normal day. She was cutting school with the girls in her gang.",
    "Act One. So what if you knew? What if you really knew the date and time of your own death? Well, Kevin Kelly spent most of his twenties wandering around Asia. He was a freelance photographer. And he found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies. He found himself drawn to religious ceremonies. He was confused about what he believed.",
    "But all that changed. When he was 27, he came into Jerusalem. It was the weekend of both Easter and Passover, and the city was flooded with tourists.",
    "So he bicycled across the country, and as he did he found himself increasingly obsessed with death, with dying. He was making drawings and writing haikus along the way, and as he went across the country, they became more and more dark, more and more preoccupied with death. And as he traveled across the country, the other thing is that he always had to find a place to stay every night. And at first he just tried what he had done in Jerusalem. That is, he would just find a church, and he would camp out on the church lawn. But people got upset at that.",
    "And so what he decided to do instead is that at each town that he would come into, he would find some quiet residential street. And he\u0027d go up to a house, and he\u0027d say hi, this is who I am. I\u0027m bicycling across the country. I\u0027ve just eaten dinner, he would say so they wouldn\u0027t feel obligated to feed him. Can I camp out in back? And invariably they would say yes, and invariably they would also at some point invite him in for coffee.",
    "Nearly two decades after that happened, Kevin Kelly is now the executive editor of a magazine about the future, Wired magazine.",
    "Coming up, more people who nearly died and what they made of it, in a minute when our program continues.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and performers and documentary producers to tackle that theme. Today\u0027s program, Should Have Been Dead, stories of people who thought they were going to die and what they learned or did not learn from the experience.",
    "We\u0027re at Act Two of our program, Maybe Six Months. Well, Lawrence Steger is a filmmaker and a performance artist here in Chicago, and I told him about Kevin Kelly\u0027s story. And it turned out that, like Kevin Kelly, at the moment that Lawrence thought he\u0027d glimpsed the possible end of his life, Lawrence also set out on a big trip.",
    "Yeah, sure.",
    "Yeah.",
    "That\u0027s a recording of Claudia Perez, who\u0027s 19 years old, an occasional contributor to this program, interviewing her 21-year-old brother. And her brother had an experience where he and his family thought he might die.",
    "And Claudia, what is on this tape?",
    "So how did you bring him around? What did you do?",
    "Why don\u0027t you take us back? What exactly happened to him?",
    "The game way is?",
    "OK. Oh, the gangway.",
    "Wait, now this guy came out of where? Was he in a car? Was he walking?",
    "Heartfelt.",

    "He doesn\u0027t drink at all?",
    "And why? Why not?",
    "That hasn\u0027t changed.",
    "How does he beat you up? Well, answer that. How can he pull that off?",
    "And when you said this to him in the hospital, he was awake, and he could--",
    "You wrote it to him, and he saw it and he read it?",
    "And did he say anything about it afterwards?",
    "And then when he came out of the hospital, it was just like back to normal?",
    "Like it never happened?",
    "So even nearly dying hasn\u0027t changed anything between the two of you?",

A friend of a friend of mine was misdiagnosed with a disease and nearly died, and it got so bad that in the end she couldn\u0027t get out of bed, had said goodbye to everybody she knew, had given away everything, spent all her money. And she said that when the doctor told her you\u0027ll live, it was actually harder than when he told her you\u0027re going to die. She thought, what now? Well, Cheryl Trykv had a similar experience, and has our next story.",

    "Matthew Goulish says that when he had cancer, he found that he couldn\u0027t cry. He would hear bad news about people who he knew, fellow patients who he heard had died, and he says that he just didn\u0027t feel much.

Or David Foster Wallace, what would they do if a couple paragraphs, four paragraphs maybe, you can fit on these tiny pages, if that required the death of, you know, a cow or a cat for every single copy of one of their books?

    "It\u0027s all flat on one side.",
    "The cat\u0027s head was still normal, but the body was blackened and dissolving. Mr. hicks slid a pitchfork under the poor thing and carried it back to his truck, where he dropped it into a metal trash can in the back. It was hot. Summer is the busy season for dead animal catchers. More animals are outside so more are dead on the road. And then there\u0027s the smell to deal with. In the hot sun, the animals decompose fast.",
    "What sort of person does this kind of work? Clarence Hicks is 51 with a gray goatee. He has kids and grandkids, but no pets. Before taking this job a year and a half ago, he worked in other divisions in the Department of Sanitation, cleaning alleys, working at the city incinerator. He says this job is definitely a step up.",
    "Driving around alone.",
    "It\u0027s not very strenuous. Mostly Mr. Hicks stops by people\u0027s houses, picks up their dead pets, or dead animals in the neighborhood. Maybe a dozen a day. Few enough so he doesn\u0027t have to rush. A dispatcher gives him a list of animals and addresses over the radio.",
    "At one house, we were supposed to find a cat. But after looking in the street, in the backyard, everywhere, we only found a fish, 10 inches long, silver blue, in perfect condition, but dead.",
    "Maybe they got confused.",
    "We had other stops. A cat under a tree, a dog covered with maggots. Over on 30th Place, we were called out for a squirrel.",
    "There it is.",
    "It took less than a minute.",
    "People have strong personal reactions to dead animals. A stranger wearing a white cap and a beeper just walked up to us and started talking.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Are you the person who called it in to the Department of Sanitation to pick this up?",
    "Back in the truck, Mr. Hicks said that in his job, you can\u0027t just throw the animals around. People will complain. You have to respect people\u0027s feelings about animals, be more funeral director than garbage man. Like yesterday, he said, when he picked up a woman\u0027s dog.",
    "What was this animal yesterday?",
    "So what did you do? What did you say?",
    "This is a big black dog.",
    "The next stop for us was the animal shelter, where ordinary people bring their animals to be put to sleep, as they say. Mr. Hicks and another animal man, William Daniels, put on aprons and gloves and carried five big, gray, plastic barrels of animals into the truck, 50 or 60 animals in all.",
    "And that garbage bucket had a couple of dogs, a couple cats.",
    "And now another dog.",
    "All the animals are taken to what Mr. Hicks calls \"The Box,\" a walk-in freezer near the city incinerator. There, the animals are lifted into metal oil barrels and left.",
    "Has this job changed the way that you see animals?",
    "Come on. I don\u0027t believe you. I feel like I see animals differently just from seeing those dogs in one of those gray, plastic--",
    "Well, that\u0027s a new point of view.",
    "I\u0027ll tell you, the next time I see a dog on the street, I\u0027m going to think to myself-- I\u0027m just going to remember what those dogs in the back of your truck looked like.",
    "They looked dead, yeah.",
    "Did you ever see those pictures of-- I guess it\u0027s the angel of death? You know, big black hood and a sickle, a guy holding a sickle? The Grim Reaper.",
    "Well, it shouldn\u0027t bother you because that\u0027s who you are for these dogs.",
    "That\u0027s you.",
    "Give them a decent disposal.",
    "A few times a week, a rendering company comes down from Baltimore to pick up the animals that Mr. Hicks has gathered and left in The Box.

A movie has been made out of Susanna Kaysen\u0027s memoir, Girl, Interrupted, about a mental hospital.

    "Although there are plenty of people with severe and debilitating mental illness just as often the line between crazy and not crazy is blurry. So many different kinds of behavior fall into both categories. And I think what captures our attention and our hearts when we talk with someone who\u0027s mentally ill, is not how they\u0027re different from us, but how they\u0027re the same.",
    "Act One, at the age of 18, after a brief appointment with a psychiatrist who she had never met before, Susanna Kaysen entered McLean Psychiatric Hospital. Her book, Girl, Interrupted, describes her stay on the ward for teenage girls, where she spent most of two years. It\u0027s partly an account of what it\u0027s like to have certain mental illnesses and partly an account of everyday life on the ward.

And one of them that you suggest is-- just to take a typical one here. One of them is using ear plugs. You say that some people have found that putting an ear plug in an ear can greatly reduce or eliminate distressing voices?",

    "In your own experience, have you successfully made voices go away completely? Do they come back sometimes for you?",
    "How do you conceive of the voices that you hear? Do you conceive of them as being separate from yourself? Or do you conceive of them as being a part of yourself that you can recognize?",

    "Wow.",

    "Pat Deegan heard voices and she was a psychologist. When she was a girl the voices were friendly. She thought everybody heard voices. She didn\u0027t know that other people didn\u0027t.",
    "But when she turned 17, the voices changed. They became vicious, critical, unbearable. She was diagnosed as a schizophrenic.",
    "Years later, as a psychologist herself, she thought the only way mental health workers can really understand what their patients go through is if they hear the voices too. So she and some other people who hear voices got together to make a tape. They talked about the kinds of things the voices normally say to them and put together a script and had it recorded. And then they set up these training sessions where mental health workers would listen to this tape on a Walkman.",
    "And the actual voices that we\u0027re hearing on the tape, are these people who actually experience voices or they--",
    "--actors? They are?",
    "And are people simply reciting the voices that they themselves hear in their head sometimes?",
    "And so, for example, I think there\u0027s a man on there who says, you disgust me. That isn\u0027t his own-- that isn\u0027t what he, himself, hears, that\u0027s what somebody else might hear?",
    "The layering of voices on the tape, is that the way people actually experience this? That they\u0027ll hear several voices at once?",
    "Are the voices generally negative? Are they saying negative things?",
    "It\u0027s interesting because over the last few days, as a been thinking about this and listening to the tape and looking at your book, I\u0027ve tried to be aware of whether in some low level way, I hear voices in my head. And I feel like I hear songs run through my head a lot more than I hear actual voices. And I was wondering if you view what voice-hearers experience as being just on a continuum from what everybody experiences in their everyday life?",
    "I feel silly that I didn\u0027t understand that up until this point. Somehow I had thought that what we were talking about were just simply-- I didn\u0027t realize that it was an auditory experience that one might confuse with actually hearing a sound in the room.",

His clothes are newly pressed. His tie is too tight in his high collar. He jingles the coins in his pockets, thinking of the witty things he\u0027s going to say. He arrives at my mother\u0027s house. He\u0027s come too early and so is suddenly embarrassed.",
    "And then the people in the theater shush the guy. You know, shush him up. The story of our parents\u0027 romance is mesmerizing because it contains everything that we are. And when we hear it, there\u0027s a part of us that wants the lovers to get together. As we do with any romantic TV show or movie, you root for the people to fall in love. But there\u0027s another part of us that knows the consequences of that love, that knows how complicated things will get after years. And we pause.",
    "Well, today on our program, a variety of people tell stories about their parents\u0027 romances. Act One, a more cheerful take on this whole subject. Act Two, parents, childhood, and bats.

    "It\u0027s This American Life from WBEZ Chicago. I\u0027m Ira Glass. And with Valentine\u0027s Day nearly upon us, we at This American Life, we wanted to do a show about romance. And we figured with all the writing about love and romance and dating and the rules, there are really only two romances any of us really want to hear about, really. And those are our own and our parents\u0027. And we\u0027re sick-- we are sick of hearing about our own and talking about our own. So we thought we\u0027d spend an hour talking about our parents.",
    "As this Delmore Schwartz story continues, it\u0027s pretty much one disturbing scene after another. The story isn\u0027t romantic in the usual way that we use the word romantic. These parents do not seem to be falling in love. They don\u0027t really seem to be in love. Instead, it\u0027s romantic in the way that great tragedy is romantic. All through the story, you can just feel the hand of fate moving in on their lives. We see their sad destiny, though they do not.",
    "They walk down the street. My mother is holding my father\u0027s arm and telling him of the novel which she has been reading. And my father utters judgments of the characters as the plot is made clear to him. This is a habit which he very much enjoys, for he feels the utmost superiority and confidence when he approves and condemns the behavior of other people. My mother feels satisfied by the interest which she\u0027s awakened. She\u0027s showing my father how intelligent she is and how interesting. My father tells my mother how much money he\u0027s made in the last week, exaggerating an amount which need not have been exaggerated. But my father has always felt that actualities somehow fall short. Suddenly I begin to weep.",
    "The parents, all through this story, they\u0027re vain, they seem unfeeling, they have pretensions. They go to Coney Island, but they avoid the rides and the shows as being beneath their dignity. At one point, they decide to get their picture taken. And the photographer looks through the camera at them, and he just feels that something is wrong. And he poses them this way and that way. But nothing he tries makes it look right. Something is wrong. And finally, the father gets impatient and makes him snap the picture. When it\u0027s developed, the picture shows the father\u0027s smile turned to a grimace. And the mother\u0027s smile bright and false.",

The father talks more and more excitedly about his future, and the waltz is playing. And then there comes this moment. I\u0027ll read.",
    "And then as the waltz reaches the moment when all the dancers swing madly, then, then with awful daring, then he asked my mother to marry him, although awkwardly enough and puzzled, even in his excitement, at how he arrived at the proposal. And she, to make the whole business worse, begins to cry. My father looks nervously about, not knowing at all what to do now. And my mother says, \"It\u0027s all I wanted from the moment I saw you,\" sobbing. And he finds all this very difficult, scarcely to his taste. Scarcely as he thought it would be, on his long walks over the Brooklyn Bridge, in the reverie of a fine cigar. And it was then that I stood up in the theater and shouted, \"Don\u0027t do it.\"",

    "Frank Sinatra himself only appears in the book once. In the scene that he\u0027s in, he\u0027s doing a concert. And one of the things that\u0027s interesting is that in a work of fiction, Michael Ventura could choose any era Sinatra concert to put in. And he decided to choose Sinatra in the mid-1990s. The reason why, he says, is because the Sinatra that exists for us today is the Sinatra of all of his ages. All of them come forward as he sings. We asked him to read his account of what Sinatra is, as rendered in this one concert.",
    "Act Two, One Sinatra Fan Versus All of Network TV. Our program today was first broadcast a few years back when Frank Sinatra was still alive. And in the original broadcast, writer Sarah Vowell made a plea to American television newscasters and a prediction about what would happen when Sinatra finally died. Here\u0027s what she said. I\u0027ll tell you at the end of her story whether her prediction came true.",
    "Well, although Sarah Vowell\u0027s plea to network television was broadcast twice on our show and once on NPR\u0027S All Things Considered, when Frank Sinatra died on May 14, 1998, just a month after we last played Sarah\u0027s commentary, every network newscast used the song \"My Way\" in its obituary. So much for the power of public radio to alter the national debate.",
    "The one exception was ABC\u0027s Nightline, which is often a maverick force in TV news. The night Sinatra died, Nightline ended its special hour-long tribute to Sinatra by playing Sarah\u0027s radio story. In other words, the person who got the last word on American network news that day, the day of Sinatra\u0027s passing, was Sarah. Her essay is now collected in her book of radio essays, Take the Cannoli.",

    "Yes, you cannot have a career as long and distinguished as Frank Sinatra\u0027s without some experiments that fail. Witness Frank Sinatra\u0027s cover of \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\" or the Rod McKuen poetry he recorded.",
    "What is that? The night makes Frank Sinatra nervous? Frank Sinatra? John Connors, who provides a lot of music for our radio program, and has a huge, huge Frank Sinatra collection, was playing me some of these Sinatra turkeys when we had this odd little moment. He was playing me Sinatra\u0027s cover of the Simon and Garfunkel hit \"Mrs. Robinson.\"",
    "Boring.",
    "Because you are post-baby boom.",
    "Act Three, So What Makes Sinatra So Special Anyway? From the time of his big breakthrough as a solo singer in 1942, Frank Sinatra simply was more emotionally expressive, more vulnerable, more openly sensual than any male pop singer to that point. But the Frank Sinatra that we think of as Frank Sinatra did not appear until the 1950s.",
    "After a career slump, after his second marriage with Ava Gardner broke up, he went into the studio to record songs with a much more tough, more swinging sound than he had done before. His public image was becoming the character who we know now-- half tough guy, half sentimental saloon singer. And Nelson Riddle invented this sound for these albums with heavy input, apparently, from Sinatra. The \u002750s are the era of nearly everything we think of today as a Sinatra standard.",
    "Music writer Will Friedwald says that the sound that Riddle invented for Sinatra is built around bass trombone, flute, muted trumpet, and strings. And there\u0027s this lightness to the orchestration with a much more complicated mix of melodies and counter melodies on different instruments than other composers were using then on pop records. Witness, for example, how Riddle used trumpeter Harry \"Sweets\" Edison.",
    "And when he plays, he\u0027s only playing almost in between the breaths.",
    "Let me play a little bit of this. He comes in here, if I understand, right after Sinatra sings \"with people she\u0027d hate.\"",

Act Four, Sinatra Has a Cold. If we want a glimpse into the life that Sinatra led during his heyday, one of the most famous accounts is by journalist Gay Talese. First published in Esquire magazine in 1966, called Sinatra Has a Cold. It\u0027s this long, funny, sad story with many, many, many scenes. We only have time for an excerpt here, which Gay Talese agreed to read for us.",

    "So Sarah was a college graduate, 22, just moved to San Francisco, broke. And while waiting for the bus on Geary Street, she called a friend. But actually, I can\u0027t tell you what the friend said without first warning you that the content of the friend\u0027s advice might not be suitable for younger listeners. In fact, the content of most of today\u0027s program-- it\u0027s This American Life by the way. I\u0027m Ira Glass-- may not be suitable for younger listeners. Today\u0027s program is Stories of Three Women and the Sex Industry.",

    "So Sarah\u0027s on the street, needs a job. Calls her friend from college. Her friend says, come do phone sex with me.",
    "Really? What was a worse job than this?",
    "Being a grant writer? A job I myself have done.",
    "Well, that was Sarah\u0027s experience. Other women have a different experience in the sex industry. Today on our program, Act One, someone whose life comes apart working in the go-go clubs. Act Two, a guy who prefers pornography to having sex with his girlfriend changes. Stay with us.",
    "And what was it like that first night? What instructions did she give you?",
    "Typed or handwritten?",
    "The guys on the phone seemed like the normal range of guys you meet, Sarah says. Some unlikable, maybe 20% she felt like she could have been friends with. Another 10% that she really liked. She would do calls where she was supposed to dominate the man and calls where she was supposed to be black or Asian.",
    "Coming up, another woman and a porn customer who changes, in a minute when our program continues.",
    "Act One, Susan.",
    "Last summer, reporter and radio producer Sandy Tolan was going to do a story about the sex industry from the worker\u0027s prospective, with a woman named Susan Walsh. Walsh was an aspiring writer who worked in go-go bars in New Jersey to support her son. And then a week or so before they were going to start work on their documentary, Susan Walsh disappeared.",
    "On July 16, she left her home in Nutley, New Jersey, to make a call at a pay phone on the corner. She didn\u0027t have a phone at home. She left her wallet, her keys, and her beeper behind. She told her son that she would be right back, and she never came back. Everybody close to her assumes that she\u0027s dead.",
    "So Sandy Tolan decided to set out on a different story. To try to understand what her life was like in the go-go bars of Jersey. And to understand what might have led to her life coming apart.",
    "Again, a warning to parents, this is another story about the sex industry. Large sections of it may not be suitable for younger listeners.",

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers, documentary producers, and performers to take a whack at that theme.

    "When my grandmother, Mollie Politzer, was just 32 years old, she got sick. So sick that she was in the hospital for months. So sick that the doctors thought she would die. So sick that finally, when all else seemed to fail, they called for a rabbi, and he changed her name. As my mom explains--",

    "So my grandmother changed her name to fool the Angel of Death. And it worked. She survived, got well, changed her name back to what it was, lived to the age of 87. There\u0027s something so medieval about this story, so unlike my family, actually, my family which basically discarded the Old World the day that they got off the boat.",
    "But I think it\u0027s easy to believe that there\u0027s something magical when you change your name. You change your name, you become a new person. You take on a different identity. You start over again, clean slate.",
    "In a way, it\u0027s a very American impulse. It\u0027s the New World. It\u0027s the move westward. It\u0027s divorce, and self-help, and 12-step programs, and Ellis Island all rolled into one. It\u0027s the story of Marilyn Monroe, and Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, and Malcolm X, and The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.",

    "For a certain group of American teenagers and college students, National Lampoon was what Saturday Night Live would be in the John Belushi, Gilda Radner years. In fact, some of the early Saturday Night Live staff came from the Lampoon. One of the Lampoon writers was a guy named Christopher Cerf. This next story is about Jack Hitt, now an adult, deciding as a teenager, to take Christopher Cerf\u0027s name in the year 1974 for himself. We invited Mr. Hitt into a studio and, to keep things fair, Mr. Cerf.",
    "Mr. Cerf\u0027s assignment for this studio session was to interview Jack Hitt about the incident. Up until this moment, the two had never met. Chris seemed very happy to be asked. Jack seemed very, very happy to tell his story.",
    "Jack Hitt and Christopher Cerf. In 1974, when Jack Hitt was pulling this prank, Cerf was in his early 30s, living in Manhattan, going to parties where nobody ever, he says, gave him this kind of adulation. He became a writer for Sesame Street, author of the song \"The Letter B,\" and many other well-known Sesame Street songs, and says that he was in on his share of pranks also.",

    "This is Dishwasher Pete, author of a zine called Dishwasher. I just realized, do I have to explain what a zine is? OK, for those of you who have not seen what zines are, zines are these little self-published, often xeroxed magazines. This particular one recounts the real-life adventures of Dishwasher Pete on his ongoing quest to wash dishes in every state in the Union. It\u0027s a combination diary and philosophical inquiry into the nature of dishwashing, what it means to wash dishes for a living. And it\u0027s so well written, and funny, and evocative that it has gotten some attention from the mainstream media.",
    "From that point on, whenever a letter arrived in the stationary of some big media outlet from Los Angeles or New York, it went straight into the garbage can, unopened. But at some point, a friend of Pete\u0027s, Jess Hilliard, said that he would love to be in Pete\u0027s shoes. He\u0027d love to be on TV. Pete figured, why deprive him of his dream? He promised that if another offer came in, he would call Jess, and Jess could go as his stand-in.",
    "Soon a letter arrived from The Letterman Show. Like a prop in some sort of old, 1960s, Barbra Streisand, Ryan O\u0027Neal movie-- soon a letter arrives in the mail from The Letterman Show. Pete kept to his promise. Having Jess impersonate him on national television, as far as he was concerned, had two big appealing things to it. Number one, Jess could get a free trip to New York, where Pete was living at the time, and the two of them could hang out. And number two, free food. There\u0027d be free food, an unimaginable quantity of it, backstage at The Letterman Show. Pete would just tag along on the taping.",
    "And here, our saga begins. The Letterman Show was so excited to book Dishwasher Pete-- they had heard, after all, that he was impossible to get on TV-- that they talked to Jess, thinking that he\u0027s Pete, every day for a week.",
    "And when a guest cancels out at the last minute for the TV show, they fly Jess to New York that very day. He arrives. They tell him, \"No, no, no, we don\u0027t need you.\" Put him up for a night in a hotel, send him back home. 10 days later, fly him to New York again.",

    "And when the radio staff and I started to assemble stories for today\u0027s show, all the stories seemed to divide off into two basic types, the stories about people who changed their name seeking a new life, a new beginning, and the stories about people changing their name hoping to perpetrate a con, a swindle. This next story falls into the second category, though it\u0027s a very small con, a very innocent con. Nobody gets hurt. No property is damaged. Nobody\u0027s feelings are wounded.

    "I\u0027m Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life, where our motto is--",
    "The question isn\u0027t, can you go home again? The question is, do you want to? From the day he left the small town he grew up in, David thought he did. He left Allendale, South Carolina for Princeton, then law school.",
    "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Small Towns, the claustrophobia and freedom and yearning for small towns. Act One, Country Mouse, City Mouse, a family moves from a tiny town to the big city, or what seems to them, anyway, like the big city.",
    "Act Two, a get-together of single farmers who are trying to get other farmers to stay in rural America by marrying them. Act three-- Three Chicago teenagers make the argument that the public housing project that they live in, a high rise building here in one of the biggest cities in the country, is actually a small town. Stay with us.",
    "Just recently, he was offered a job with a country lawyer back home. And so he and his wife have to decide, what are they going to do? She grew up on a farm outside Allendale. They were childhood sweethearts. And deciding where to go, it\u0027s the biggest question in their marriage.",
    "In a sense, their dispute comes down to a difference over how they view a central fact of small town life, that feeling that comes when you know everybody knows you and knows your business. He likes that feeling.",
    "Her views on abortion and race relations didn\u0027t square with the prevalent opinions in Allendale. The speech she gave as high school valedictorian, a speech critical of the school system, was a minor town scandal. People apparently talked about it for months. And so, for now, they\u0027re stuck living in Manhattan, trying to decide if they see small town life as cozy or as claustrophobic.",
    "Act one-- City Mouse, Country Mouse. One of the classic American stories is the migration from small town to big city, and all the personal growth, and dangers, and freedom that happen when you make that move. Our contributing editor, Sarah Vowell, went through that change yourself, with her family, but with one small catch. The big city that her family moved to wasn\u0027t New York, or Los Angeles, or Boston. It was Bozeman, Montana, population 30,000. Which sounds like a small town to anybody who lives in a city, but it was, in fact, 30 times larger than Braggs, Oklahoma where they started.",
    "Sarah Vowell\u0027s move to big-city Bozeman was so successful that she decided to repeat the experience. She move to Portland, population 500,000, Washington DC, population 600,000, San Francisco, population 700,000, and then, finally, Chicago, population 2.8 million.",
    "Evening winds down, and the couples at SIA head toward the climactic night of their weekend, in a minute, when our program continues.",
    "Act Two. How do you keep them going down on the farm? Marry \u0027em. All across America, people are moving away from small towns and rural areas in steady streams. So if you have stayed in a place where there aren\u0027t many people, and the ones that are there you\u0027ve know since birth, how are you going to find somebody to marry? Well, you might join Singles In Agriculture. They hold get-togethers for singles all over the country. Reporter Liz Weil went with This American Life producer Alix Spiegel to a recent get-together in Galveston, Texas, at the Flagship Hotel on the beach, jutting out onto the water. There were about 250 people from 26 states at meals and meetings, day trips, and dances.",
    "Act Three, Small town in the big city. The fact is a small town can be anywhere, even in the heart of what many people see as one of the harshest urban environments in the country. Paul Johnson, Carlos Appleby, and Sanantonio Brooks are teenagers living in public housing on Chicago\u0027s South Side at 4120 South Prairie. People who live there just call the building, 4120. It\u0027s a highrise building, 16 stories tall, 10 apartments on each floor, with an open air hallway on each floor that people who live there just call a porch. We sent them out with a tape recorder to their building to record what happens there, and then talked to them in our studios about how their building is like a small town.",
    "A real candy store?",
    "A real candy store. There\u0027s a real candy store.",
    "And is it like a real candy store? It\u0027s like somebody\u0027s apartment, they have a little fix-it-up?",
    "Compare the two candy stores, 5th and the 12th, which is the better one?",
    "Why?",
    "So what happens on the other floors? Tell me about what happens on six. What\u0027s it like?",
    "Nobody\u0027s living in any of those apartments?",
    "And why those floors?",
    "OK, now you guys should explain where we are.",
    "And is this a card game that happens all the time?",
    "Now, are these guys your age or are they older?",
    "What card game are they playing?",
    "Of the three of you, who\u0027s the best card player?",
    "OK, let\u0027s play a little more of the tape.",
    "Now, I\u0027ve got to say, now when you first played this tape, when you first gave this tape to producer Nancy Updike and I, we heard this and we thought, yeah, how do you lose your job on your day off? Like, what is this with these guys? But in fact, there is something else going on here, isn\u0027t there?",
    "Let\u0027s hear that scene.",
    "You guys all act out scenes from movies a lot while you\u0027re playing cards?",
    "Now, you actually tried to interview these guys while you sat there playing cards. And you tried for, like, an hour.",
    "You think in some ways it is like a small town?",
    "All right, run it down. Let me hear. Who and who floor, give it to me from top to bottom.",
    "And just let me be sure. When you stay on the fifth, who are you staying with?",
    "And on the eighth?",
    "And you interviewed your grandmother, right?",
    "And she grew up in a small town, right?",
    "Now, Paul, you also interviewed your own mom.",
    "OK, let\u0027s hear that.",
    "Is this the way she talks all the time?",
    "Now, Carlos, you\u0027re on the second floor, right?",
    "And what\u0027s your floor like?",
    "You\u0027re living around a bunch of drug addicts and it\u0027s boring?",
    "Let me just ask you to explain what work is?",
    "What would you guys say is the biggest problem at 4120?",
    "Yeah, for you all, anyway.",
    "Explain where the girls go.",
    "Now, do you just think it\u0027s a coincidence that girls leave? Or do you think it\u0027s one of these things where the families say, well, this building, it\u0027s kind of rough, and we don\u0027t want a girl around in this environment, we\u0027re going to take our girls out? Whereas people with boys, they just stick around.",
    "You just don\u0027t feel that the girls in the building, there aren\u0027t that many who are doing that much that\u0027s positive?",
    "If 4120 is a small town, is it one where you guys would choose to live if you had a choice?",
    "Why a basement, of all the things to name? Why a basement?",
    "If their building is, in fact, a kind of small town, then when they move away, Sanantonio, and Carlos, and Paul will probably experience what Sarah Vowell\u0027s mom experienced, what the couple I interviewed at the beginning of this program experienced when they moved away from their small towns, which is, they find they don\u0027t exactly fit into the new worlds they move to, but they no longer fit in their hometown anymore, either. As Letta Sneed, the wife of the couple at the beginning of the show said--",
    "It\u0027s like you ate from the Tree of Knowledge.",

    "I\u0027m Ira Glass, back next week with more stories of This American Life.",
    "Like a lot of kids, he liked to play with fire. He\u0027d snap off match heads from matches, pile them up and light them. He\u0027d make little paper boats, float them in the toilet and set fire to them.",
    "In her short story \"Some Say the World,\" Susan Perabo has a character explain what\u0027s so thrilling to her about setting fires. \"It\u0027s the moment when it may or may not go out of control,\" Susan Perabo writes. \"The thing about fire is this-- it\u0027s yours for one glorious moment. You bear it, you raise it.",
    "\"The first time, in a record store downtown, I stood over the bathroom trashcan thinking I would not let it grow. That I would love it only to a point and then kill it. That\u0027s the trick with fire, for that 30 seconds you have a choice, spit on it, step on it, douse it with a can of Coke. But wait one moment too long, get caught up in its beauty, and it\u0027s grown beyond your control. And it is that moment that I live for, the relinquishing. The power passes from you to it. The world opens up and you with it. I cried in the record store when the flame rose above my head, not from fear, but from ecstasy.\"",
    "Hello from WBEZ in Chicago. It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, stories of people who are not appropriately scared of fire. Act one, Firestarter, why one teenager set fires and then stopped setting them. Act two, Centralia, an inextinguishable subterranean fire on the edge of a small Pennsylvania town, and why the few remaining residents are not afraid of it.",
    "Act three, Firewalk. That act is about a guy who is not afraid of walking on burning coals, and how he might have been safer if he had simply taken the simple precaution of being afraid. Act four, The Big Picture on fire, the really, really, really big picture. Act five, The Fire Within. Stay with us.",
    "In trying to find a pyromaniac to interview for today\u0027s program, one thing we discovered is that, first, it\u0027s actually very rare. A real mania, somebody with a real mania, psychological compulsion to set fires. Second, when it does occur, psychologists classify it as a sexual disorder, often as a sign of sexual abuse. That wasn\u0027t the case with this guy. He was mild compared to a real pyromaniac.",
    "Act one, Firestarter. Our firestarter is 29, lives in New York City, and he moved from a casual interest in fire to arson, to actual criminality. And what\u0027s striking about his story is that he wasn\u0027t motivated by anger, or revenge, or any mean feelings toward anybody. He just wanted to stare at a fire the way a child does, and he didn\u0027t want to restrain himself, the way an adult does.",
    "Act two, Centralia. This is the story of a town decimated by fire.",
    "Lamar Mervine looks out the window of the municipal building at Locust and Centre Street, what used to be the middle of town.",
    "Grocery store?",
    "So describe this now.",
    "Only one store now stands on Centre Street, vacant lots surround it. Perhaps two dozen homes are left out of the hundreds that used to be here. Centralia once had 3,000 people in it. Now there are 40. And the fire that decimated this town, that scattered its inhabitants far and wide, never touched a single home, never singed a building. This is a town destroyed by the idea of fire. And the fire itself never came.",
    "The fire that led to the evacuation of Centralia began out on the edge of town in an abandoned strip mine pit in 1962. There are 30 underground mine fires like this burning around Pennsylvania right now. They can burn slowly, for years. Most don\u0027t endanger anybody. But Centralia\u0027s built over old coal mines, and the fear was that the fire would jump from mine to mine and end up under the center of town.",
    "I met with five of the remaining residents of Centralia-- one eighth of the town-- in the town council\u0027s meeting room. John Comarnisky, a science teacher at a nearby high school, was quick to pull up various government charts and reports that prove, he says, that the subterranean fire is not a danger to the town.",
    "Helen Womer says the reason the government has tried to convince the people of Centralia that their town is in danger and evacuated the town is because Centralia sits on as much as $3.2 billion-- that\u0027s billion-- worth of coal.",
    "They don\u0027t have a lot of hard evidence to prove this government conspiracy. No paper trail, no witnesses, no names they\u0027re willing to name on the record. But what they do seem to be entirely correct about is this-- in 35 years, the fire has not moved from the edge of town toward the center, and has not injured anyone.",
    "What seems to have happened in Centralia is this-- the fire burned for 19 years, and then in 1981 came one of those turning point, made for TV events that can take your average, ongoing, unextinguished subterranean fire, and turn it into a state-wide media circus.",
    "This is a video made by the state to brief its own policy makers on the history of the fire.",
    "Before the story hit the TV news, the big political fight in Centralia was townspeople trying to get the government to block the fire or put it out. After the story hit the TV news, the government declared there was no way to tell where the fire might go next. They decided to evacuate. Bill Clank, who headed the location effort, says it was the only reasonable decision. Twice the state tried to erect barriers to block the fire, he says, and twice it jumped the barriers.",
    "The government calculated that it would cost $42 million to buy everyone\u0027s home. The request was put into the federal government. Once people heard about the potential money, says Helen Womer, the town split. Lots of people were living in these old houses built by the coal companies decades before.",
    "Two community organizations faced off. One, to keep people in Centralia and the fire out; the other to sell out and get out. People in the other camp knew where Helen Womer stood. They would blow smoke in her face in public, throw their pass books at her when she worked her bank teller job. Somebody lit an M-80 firecracker on her lawn. Somebody else threw a cat at her.",
    "Did that happen to you?",
    "If you talk to former Centralia residents like Jerry Wasachanski, leaving town wasn\u0027t a grand betrayal, not at all. He says he had a heart attack, wanted to move into a house where he wouldn\u0027t have to shovel coal down in the basement into the furnace.",
    "He and several other former residents did confirm what Helen Womer told me, though, that he was never scared of the underground fire reaching his house, never scared of underground gases seeping up and killing him. Mostly, he says, he moved because of the great deal the government gave him for his old house.",
    "$55,000 on a $3,000 investment-- a 2,000% profit. Now Jerry lives with his son Rob, about a 10 minute drive from Centralia, in Mount Carmel, where lots of former Centralians live. Rob says they held out a long time before they moved, that Centralia changed.",
    "As with most government operations on the scale of this evacuation, there are really two ways that people look at what happened in Centralia. As a conspiracy, the way the remaining townspeople see it, or as simple human incompetence, the way Jerry\u0027s son Rob sees it.",
    "But all the guys who would have made the mistake, they\u0027re already probably gone now anyways. It was 20 years ago.",
    "They can\u0027t just say, fire moved, thought it was going to go this way, it went this way.",
    "Actually, there\u0027s a third way to view what happened in Centralia, the way that Bill Clank, head of the relocation effort, sees it, which is as a government program that actually worked. A rare example of government competence and generosity.",
    "In 1992, after a decade of voluntary relocation of the people from Centralia, the state condemned the remaining homes there, told everyone they had to get out, declared eminent domain. The mayor and town council back then took this to court. They appealed it all the way up to the US Supreme Court. They did not win one case.",
    "Then the town council back then resigned, left town, saying it was over. They\u0027d lost. Legally, no one has the right to stay in Centralia anymore. For the 40 diehards who still live there, like Helen Womer, these final departures were the bitterest betrayal.",
    "And does she live nearby still?",
    "So very close?",
    "But you\u0027re not social anymore?",
    "Now in the long stretch of grass that used to be the middle of town, someone put in some benches and a sign that says, we love Centralia. Jerry Wasaschinski and the other old men who left town because of the idea of a fire travel from their homes elsewhere, come back to Centralia, not for the town that it is, but for the idea of the town it was.",
    "Man, oh man, oh man. Well, coming up we step back for the big picture on humans and fire-- the really big picture. That\u0027s in a minute, when our program continues.",
    "Act three, Fearless. This is the story about somebody who wasn\u0027t scared of fire and who did get burned because of it. Ki Kim studied Buddhism, meditated, avoided red meat. When a friend sent him an email inviting him on a firewalk retreat, he thought, why not? He\u0027d been feeling sort of low.",
    "The idea of the retreat is that you go, meditate, and at the culmination of the weekend, walk across hot coals. To make a long story short, he ended up with near third degree burns that made it difficult to walk for weeks. He spoke with This American Life producer Nancy Updike.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and performers to contribute various kinds of stories on the theme. Today\u0027s show, people who are not afraid of fire.",
    "We\u0027ve arrived at act four, as promised, The Big Picture. Stephen Pyne, a professor, believes that we Americans as a people, as a group, are too afraid of fire. And he says that this has all sorts of practical consequences. For example, in Yellowstone National Park, Pyne says the Forest Service policy of suppressing fires for the last 100 years out of fear of fire has led to an incredible overgrowth of flammable material, which caused the fires in 1988 that destroyed half the park. In other words, by trying to avoid fires, we called them down upon us.",
    "Pyne says that what humans have done throughout history is set fires in a controlled way, and that part of our problem today is the way that we think about fire, that we do not see it as a practical tool, that we\u0027re afraid of it.",
    "Let me ask you, when you talk about societies where fire is valued, what societies are you thinking of? Are we talking about most agricultural societies?",
    "In other words, we\u0027ve gone from actually having real bonfires to these tiny little combustions inside engines?",
    "Actually, as you describe this, I realized all of the movies, and all of the previews for movies I\u0027ve seen lately, where fire is a huge element in those movies. There\u0027s a whole sequence of movies out now where volcanoes set cities on fire. I was at one of the Star Wars movies, and one of the things that struck me was just how much of the movie was simply about blowing things up.",
    "But are you arguing, in some way, that we have this visual fetish for fire because fire is not a part of our everyday lives anymore?",
    "Well, what kind of iconography do you want to see?",
    "And children would sometimes follow the example of Smokey the one who sets the fires, the other Smokey?",
    "I don\u0027t know if a lot of parents are going to go with you on that one.",
    "Are you arguing in some way we need to get back to fire? We need to embrace fire more than we are?",
    "We have a species monopoly, meaning other animals have not mastered fire and we have?",
    "I was going to say, if snakes get fire, what will we do?",
    "If cows get fire--",
    "Yeah.",
    "Stephen Pyne is the author of the books Burning Bush, Fire in America, and World Fire.",
    "Act five, The Fire Within. To be honest, this next story isn\u0027t really about fire. It\u0027s called fire. It mentions fire. The writer\u0027s name is Rennie Sparks. But basically, we just really liked this story, and we thought we would end the show with it today.",
    "Rennie Sparks.",
    "Our program today was produced by Alix Spiegel and myself, with Paul Tough, Julie Snyder, Nancy Updike, contributing editor Sarah Vowell, Jack Hitt, and Margie Rockland. Music help today from Steve Cushing. Susan Perabo\u0027s story originally appeared in TriQuarterly.",

    "Welcome to WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, The Business of Death, people who work with the dead, people who see death every day. Do they know anything about it that we don\u0027t?",
    "Act One of our program, The Undertaking. Funeral director Thomas lynch conducts his own father\u0027s funeral. Act Two, The Forbidden Zone. Writer Michael Lesy tells us about his own journey to figure out what autopsy pathologists, homicide detectives, slaughterhouse workers, and others who deal with death know about death. Act Three, Fireman Larry Brown. Act Four, writer David Sedaris explains how to sneak a corpse into a four star hotel, and why you might want to, and how his friends actually have. And Act Five, The Happiest Death Worker, proving that it\u0027s all not doom and gloom in the death biz. Stay with us.",
    "This is the way we usually think about death. We stare at it, trying to comprehend. Here\u0027s Allen Ginsberg.",
    "When we think about death, we stare at the two images in our head over and over. The person we knew alive, breathing and talking, and the thought of them dead. And we take these two pictures and we turn them around and around, shuffle one on top of the other, trying to understand. How did this living person become that dead one?",
    "The early part of Allen Ginsberg\u0027s poem, \"Kaddish,\" mourning his dead mother, is a series of these images.",
    "This is the way we usually think about death. But there\u0027s another way. Death isn\u0027t just a mystery, a tragedy. It\u0027s also a business. Somebody has to sell embalming supplies, somebody has to drive a hearse, somebody has to kill cows for beef, and kill cockroaches in people\u0027s houses.",
    "Act One, The Undertaking. When researching today\u0027s show, one of our producers talked with a funeral director who said at one point, well, you know, all funeral directors are either alcoholics or born-agains. Which seems like an exaggeration, but clearly this is a job with some pressure and stress to it that takes its toll on many people.",
    "Well, Thomas Lynch is an undertaker in Milford, Michigan. He says that it is not the sort of job where you get rich, usually. He says you can afford an orthodontist for your kids but not boarding school. And so, he says, you do not stay in this job unless you get some sort of satisfaction from it.",
    "Most people, he says, could not be paid enough to embalm a neighbor on Christmas, stand with a widower at his wife\u0027s open casket, talk with a leukemic mother about her fears for her children about to be motherless. He says that the ones who stay with this work believe that they actually are helping the living in some way by burying their dead.",
    "Thomas Lynch, reading from his memoir, The Undertaking, which will be published in July by Norton.",
    "Act Two, The Forbidden Zone. In a certain sense, writer Michael Lesy is in the business of death himself. He\u0027s the author of, Wisconsin Death Trip, The Forbidden Zone, and other writings which either touch on or obsess over the subject. In his book, The Forbidden Zone, he heads out to talk with all sorts of people in the business of death-- autopsy pathologists, executioners on death row, mercenaries, undertakers, homicide detectives-- on a quest of understanding.",
    "Let me ask you to read from a scene where you go to an autopsy. Let me ask you to turn to page 33 in the book. Because this is a fairly typical kind of a scene of the sort of things that you would encounter when you would go out.",
    "Post, meaning a?",
    "Do you think that the pathologists, who you visited, do you think that they actually did understand something about death that you didn\u0027t walking into it?",
    "Right, and that\u0027s at the center of our fascination with death, as lay people.",
    "It\u0027s interesting that both the pathologist and the homicide detective, they basically, in your description, you talk about how they\u0027re both looking at the body. They don\u0027t look at death. What they do is that they look at the body for clues, for what happened, for clues about the story that they\u0027re writing.",
    "But again, do you view what they\u0027re doing, that is, trying to take the body, trying to take the fact of this death and turn it into some kind of meaning, as being in any way parallel to what you were doing, coming on to the scene, trying to take the fact of these deaths and turn them into some sort of meaning? Or is it very different?",
    "At one point you write that at the bottom of the hierarchy of death jobs is the slaughterhouse. Let me ask you to talk about what you found there.",
    "You went to a slaughterhouse in Omaha.",
    "At one point when you were there, you\u0027re watching the person who actually kills the animals, and he operates an airgun, which presses a bolt into the animal\u0027s skull, and he hands it to you. He says, go ahead, try it.",
    "You killed the steer.",
    "Can I ask you to talk about how that changed your story, your perception of what you were writing?",
    "And actually, in an earlier scene, a detective says to you, everbody is a killer, everybody could be a killer. And you tell him, not me.",
    "And so, once you killed the steer--",
    "Do you believe that being around death so much taints a person? Do you believe that it tainted you?",
    "What do you mean by that?",
    "Did you find that people who had these kinds of jobs viewed people who did not have these kinds of jobs and this contact with death at a distance?",
    "When you set out on your journey, you actually thought that these people would have some kind of knowledge, and that, by observing them and talking to them, you might learn something from them. But, in fact, it seems more what happened was, you simply got to see what they saw, that it wasn\u0027t the things people told you, and it wasn\u0027t the stories of the people who died, but simply being able to have contact with the physical fact, the concrete fact that this happens.",
    "We turn our eyes away from death.",
    "You said when we began that one of the reasons that you set out to go and see these things and see these people was that you wanted help in dealing with your own father\u0027s then-impending death. Did you find what you wanted? Did you find something that actually helped you?",
    "Do you feel like going through this experience and reflecting on it and writing, I mean, in one way or another, about death and things related to death since then, do you think that it\u0027s helped you in thinking about your own death?",
    "Michael Lesy, author of The Forbidden Zone, and other books.",
    "Well, coming up, David Sedaris, Smuggler, a fireman, and others in the business of death. That\u0027s in a minute, when our program continues.",

Today\u0027s program-- The Business Of Death. Stories about people who are near death, every day, in their jobs, and what they see that we don\u0027t.",
    "Act Three, Fireman. One of the things that Michael Lesy wrote about when he went with homicide detectives out on their cases, is that when they find a corpse, they don\u0027t think about the more existential questions about death.

    "This is a story not just of a mediocre play or a terrible play. When it comes right down to it, it\u0027s not even a story about a play. This is a story about a fiasco and about what makes a fiasco. And one ingredient of many fiascos is that great, massive, heart-wrenching chaos and failure are more likely to occur when great ambition has come into play, when plans are big, expectations great, hopes at their highest.",

Act Three, Car Wars, the true story of how putting NPR\u0027s show Car Talk on the air in Wisconsin led not just to hundreds of angry letters from listeners, not just to a protest rally, not just to a monthly newsletter devoted to the scandal, but eventually, a state audit and state hearings by the legislature.

If the very premise of your character is that you have a hook, your name is Captain Hook, literally, all that\u0027s going to happen for the rest of the show is people are going to refer to you by that hook, your entire motivation as a character is the fact that your arm was eaten off by an alligator and that you have to have a hook.",

    "Oh, they get hungry for more fiasco.",
    "If the play proceeded perfectly, they would be disappointed.",
    "Before you do this, I just want to explain. When we say, \"breaking down the fourth wall,\" what we mean is the wall between the actors and the audience. Usually, it\u0027s impermeable. But then, there came a point in the late \u002760s, early \u002770s, where a lot of theaters-- basically, the actors would come out into the audience.",
    "Right.",
    "Oh, my god.",
    "That\u0027s horrible.",
    "No matter what.",
    "What\u0027s interesting about this as a fiasco, I feel like the thing that it makes me understand about fiascos, is that the fiasco itself is an altered state. That is, all the normal rules are off. You have left the normal rules of how the audience is going to interact with the actors.",
    "See, but I wonder, when you think about what people go to theater for, what kind of release people want, people want an experience that will take them out of themselves. We all want an experience that will take us out of ourselves and into another place and another reality. And it sounds like this production-- even though it was a fiasco, in fact, because it was a fiasco-- was more successful at that than any conventional play could be.",
    "Our baser selves.",
    "Act Two, What We Wanted to Do. With some fiascos, all social order breaks down. With others, a thing that you\u0027re trying to create simply refuses to be created. And this next fiasco falls into that second category. Ron Carlson wrote this story. Jeff Dorchen reads it.",
    "\"What We Wanted to Do\" is from Ron Carlson\u0027s book of short stories called Hotel Eden.",
    "Coming up, how a friendly little radio show about cars from the fair city of Boston ended up the subject of legislative hearings in Wisconsin and other fiascos. That\u0027s in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week ON our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Fiasco!, our own inquiry into the nature of what makes a fiasco, and when you have left the realm of mishap, stumble, human error, and entered the more rarefied realm of fiasco. We have arrived at Act Three, Car Wars. If you are hearing the sound of my voice right now, you probably have also heard these voices.",
    "This is Car Talk. And though you may think of it as simply the friendly banter of Tom and Ray Magliozzi, Click and Clack, it is also the single most popular hour in public radio. And this story starts simply enough. Wisconsin Public Radio, a network of 14 stations in, guess which state, decided they wanted to save a few bucks. And years ago, when nearly every other public radio station in the country signed up with the most single popular show in public radio, Wisconsin public radio thought, it\u0027ll cost money. It\u0027ll cost us tens of thousands of dollars. And it\u0027s just a car show. We can do our own car show. So they did.",
    "Matt Joseph\u0027s show All About Cars, was on Saturday mornings, where most public radio stations run Car Talk, the most popular show on public radio. He was the car expert. She would prompt him along, asking the questions that you or I might ask. Call-ins went into much more technical detail about engines than you ever hear from Tom and Ray. And the show started with 10 minutes of serious automotive industry news.",
    "It was a perfectly decent, solid, informative hour of radio. And while it was not the single most popular show on public radio, it got good ratings, had fans, did great in pledge drives. Matt Joseph thought he was doing everything right. Now, a fiasco can begin, like any human dispute, with a simple misunderstanding, a difference in perspective. And in this case, Matt Joseph\u0027s bosses had a completely different perspective on his show from his perspective.",
    "Sure, he got great ratings, his bosses thought, but it could be so much more, if only he more like, well, like the most popular single show on public radio, Car Talk. They were constantly trying to get him to make his show snappier, faster paced, more of an entertainment. Matt Joseph thought they were wrong. They were always threatening to cancel him and bring in Car Talk. They wrote unpleasant memos, and there were tense meetings. And this fundamental disagreement laid the groundwork for the fiasco that followed.",
    "Finally, because of a complicated deal involving Whad\u0027Ya Know?, Michael Feldman\u0027s game show, which is produced by Wisconsin Public Radio, the price of Car Talk to Wisconsin Public Radio dropped from $33,000 to an affordable $10,000. And the network which had thought that it did not need the single most popular show on public radio looked over its shoulder at what was happening on 400 other radio stations and decided that maybe, in fact, they had been wrong. They wanted Car Talk. Joy Cardin is one of the Wisconsin Public Radio programmers behind all this.",
    "Of course, 9:00 in the morning was when All About Cars was on the air. But, says, Joy Cardin, they did not want to kill All About Cars. They simply wanted to move it to a different time.",
    "Did you name a specific time?",
    "So what happened then? What was his response?",
    "Now, to understand why he would say no to 3 o\u0027clock, you have to understand that, from Matt Joseph\u0027s perspective, this was just the latest insult from bosses who had always doubted and questioned the way he did his show. It made no sense to him, this treatment. After all, his ratings were strong. Sometimes, he was the single strongest show in their Saturday morning lineup. His show was inexpensive. It was a success. Why couldn\u0027t they be more respectful?",
    "Now, you know, one definition of a fiasco is something small and ordinary that turns into something monstrously large. And what could be smaller in this world, my friend, than simply trying to reschedule a public radio car show from the morning to the afternoon? Well after his show was canceled, 1,500 calls and letters came into Wisconsin Public Radio, demanding that Matt Joseph be put back on the air. Contributors to the network demanded $2,600 in pledges to be returned. 126 people said they would never give money to the network again. Matt Joseph started putting out a monthly newsletter about the fiasco. He organized a rally in Madison. There were editorials in local papers and letters to the editor. Against his will, he said, it became his cause.",
    "Well, finally, the state of Wisconsin legislature, which gives millions each year to Wisconsin Public Radio, did a state audit investigating the matter, interviewing programmers, showing up at the offices of Wisconsin Public Radio.",
    "If you had to estimate how much time state employees, taxpayer-paid employees, had to spend and ended up spending investigating this, was it two guys for a week? How long were they on this case?",
    "Oh, my god.",
    "But this was not the only use of taxpayer dollars on this urgent public matter. A joint audit committee of the state legislature held a public hearing, in which legislators and listeners criticized Wisconsin Public Radio programmers. 40 people showed up from all over the state to testify. It made headlines throughout the state. And all this over whether a car show should\u0027ve been moved to the afternoon or taken off the air. Senator Robert Wirch, who co-chaired the hearing, says the citizens of Wisconsin were mad. He had no choice but to have hearings.",
    "I have to say, though, as an outsider, as somebody who doesn\u0027t live in Wisconsin, it just is so strange, the notion that the state legislature would get involved with an issue, what seems so small.",
    "Well, for some perspective on this matter, I decided to go to the top, to the men behind the single most popular hour in public radio, Click and Clack, Tom and Ray Magliozzi.",
    "Since you guys weren\u0027t at the hearings to speak in your own defense, I wanted to play you a quote from State Senator Robert Wirch, who held these hearings.",
    "Wirch.",
    "Senator Robert Wirch of the good state of Wisconsin, who held these hearings. And I wanted to just play what he said about your show versus the local show, which was hosted by a guy named Matt Joseph, and just give you a chance to respond.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Response?",
    "Apparently not. No, there apparently was an entire hearing, and nobody spoke for the two of you.",
    "In a sense, the Wisconsin car show fiasco happens on a much smaller scale whenever any show with any following is taken off any public radio station in this country. People get upset, partly, I think, because every pledge drive-- which is, what, three or four times a year on most of these stations-- listeners hear programmers like me say, \"You are the \u0027public\u0027 in public radio.\" And so listeners are understandably angry, being the \"public\" in public radio, when a show they like is suddenly gone. But it is exactly incidents like this one in Wisconsin, and programmers\u0027 fear of incidents like this one in Wisconsin, that makes innovation so slow in most of the public radio system.",
    "Joy Cardin, who spent months dealing with the Wisconsin car show fiasco, says that now she thinks twice before moving any show.",
    "This fiasco is also a parable of bigger changes coming within the public radio system. Partly because of the success of Car Talk, there is a move to come up with lighter, more entertaining shows in the public radio system, especially for weekends. Matt Joseph\u0027s fiasco occurred partly because he represented an older style of public radio, a more informative style. After some months off the air, Matt Joseph now does his show All About Cars on a commercial station, WDTY in Madison. He\u0027s on up against Car Talk.",
    "Hey, Matt?",
    "Is this over for you yet?",
    "You\u0027re describing all these things that used to be the kinds of things that were on public radio that didn\u0027t draw much audience.",
    "Act Four, Fiascoes as a Force for Good. George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston, Shannon Dougherty, Jodie Foster, Alicia Silverstone, Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves, Sharon Stone, and John Travolta. Also, George Burns, Bob Hope, Gene Kelly, Gena Rowlands. Also, Quentin Tarantino, John Waters, Nora Ephron, Joel Schumacher. Margy Rochlin has interviewed all these people. She does big magazine feature stories for big magazines. But the very, very first big feature assignment she was actually sent out on by a publication was in 1982. The Los Angeles Reader sent out a very nervous, very youthful Margy Rochlin to interview Moon Unit Zappa, daughter of Frank, who had consented to her second interview ever after the release of her runaway hit song, \"Valley Girl.\"",
    "She was one of your people. Speak to her in your secret, private argot.",
    "So you get there, and you\u0027re a bit nervous. And the pressure is on, which is, of course, the setting for a possible triumph or a possible fiasco.",
    "And what happens next?",
    "Right. Well, we have a recording of it, because you had a tape recorder rolling during this.",
    "Shooting out your nose?",
    "She began chasing you?",
    "Well, I\u0027ve been in the news business-- I\u0027ve been a reporter for 20 years. And nobody has ever given me the Heimlich maneuver while I\u0027ve been on a story.",
    "Now, what happened after that?",
    "Wow.",
    "It\u0027s interesting, because one of our criteria for a fiasco is that all social order, the normal social structure, breaks down. And literally, that\u0027s what happens here. The normal interview stops. And the social structure of the moment completely changes. The mom gives you the Heimlich maneuver. And then, suddenly, it stops feeling like an interview.",
    "That moment.",
    "To me, the thing about it that\u0027s useful is that it shows the useful purpose of a fiasco. That is, when social order breaks down, that could be a force not just for chaos and for entropy and for evil, but, in fact, that could be a force for good.",
    "It can bring people together.",
    "Of Valleyspeak terms.",
    "And most of the quotable stuff that you ended up using in your story happened after the incident?",
    "Happened after squirting the coffee through your nose.",

When the starting whistle blows, each person puts one hand on the truck. They wear white gloves so as not to mess up the paint job. And they stand there and stand there until, one by one, people get tired, they drop away. And finally, one person is left standing. That person gets to keep the truck. How tough could this be? Under the contest rules, you get a 5-minute break every hour and a 15-minute break every 6 hours. And to the contestants at first, it sounds like easy money. Something for nothing.",
    "These interviews are part of a movie about this contest. Filmmakers Rob Bindler, Chapin Wilson, and Kevin Morse take us through the contest hour by hour. And over the course of the documentary, we get to know several of the contestants pretty well, especially one guy, Benny Perkins.",

And some people structure their lives around collecting old records, or around sex, or theater, or politics, or Star Trek, or basketball.",
    "I\u0027ve been a one thing person. Maybe you\u0027ve been a one thing person too. Arnie certainly was. And his new one thing, the lord, filled the same place in his life that the old one thing, the gang, used to.",
    "You feel the same way about Christianity as you did about the gang?",
    "Well, today on our program, One Thing People. People who organize their lives around just one idea and the price they pay for that.",
    "Act One, when your one thing is your ex-girlfriend.",
    "Act Two, Inescapable Logic. What happens when you take a utopian vision of nudism, yes, nudism, to its logical end as your one thing. This is the true story of a nude presidential candidate.",
    "Act Three, more than one thing. How journalist Philip Weiss came to agree with some Clinton conspiracy theorists, but decided not to follow their cause.",
    "Act Four, Quitting Quitting. Regrets from a former one-thinger. Stay with us.",
    "From the time he was 13 until the time he was 17, Arnie\u0027s life was organized around one thing, the Latin Kings, a huge street gang here in Chicago. Then when he was 17, some kids dragged him to youth group and church services until one day, he felt the presence of the lord and he believed. And Arnie quit his gang. He still organized his life around one thing, but now the one thing was God.",
    "But when you quit a street gang, one of the problems that you face is that your former enemies do not know that you\u0027ve quit. They see you on the street and they come after you. And you don\u0027t have your old gang to protect you anymore. There\u0027s no way to let everybody know. You can\u0027t just publish a notice in the federal register in the classified ads of your local paper. And so guys kept coming up to Arnie on the street trying to fight him or shoot him.",
    "Once, for example, some gang kids came up and Arnie happened to be walking with a guy who was a friend of theirs.",
    "Arnie told me a lot of these stories. And they\u0027re all like stories from the Bible. The stories where Paul goes out among the non-believers and they want to hurt him and he\u0027s filled with the holy spirit, the bible says. And then for some reason, because I guess he\u0027s filled with the holy spirit, they do not hurt him. Sometimes Arnie think his life is lot like those stories.",
    "Act One, Life Without Leanne.",
    "Well, let\u0027s start our show with the kind of one thing behavior most people at some point or another have gone through themselves. Taken, perhaps just a step or two further than most of us have taken it.",
    "Larry Doyle writes for The Simpsons and wishes it known that he now loves Becky.",
    "Chicago playwright Beau O\u0027Reilly.",
    "Act Two, Inescapable Logic. When you\u0027re seized by one idea, by one thing, it\u0027s not like you choose it. It\u0027s like it chooses you. And often the one thing has a logic to it that seems inescapable. These are perfectly logical consistent systems once you get inside them. Macrobiotics, Mormonism, the JFK assassination theories.",
    "This is a story of someone who found the logic of his one thing irresistible and he followed that logic to its logical end. And it\u0027s the story of what happened to him as a result. This is a true story set in 1976. Chicago playwright, Beau O\u0027Reilly, tells this story.",
    "Before we begin, a quick parental advisory. There is nudity in this story. No sex, nothing very explicit, but there is nudity.",
    "Eddie\u0027s trial for indecency and his presidential campaign, which takes him to the 1976 Republican National Convention. That\u0027s in a minute, when our program continues.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life, I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme and bring you a wide variety of stories, different kinds of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s show, One Thing. People who are obsessed with one thing.",
    "We are in the middle of act two. Beau O\u0027Reilly\u0027s story continues. His friend, Eddie, is a one-thinger who believes in a kind of utopian nudity and is coming up on trial for indecent exposure. Again, a parental advisory. There\u0027s nudity in this story.",
    "Act Three, More Than One Thing.",
    "Well, up until now on our program, we\u0027ve been hearing about eager, full-hearted one-thingers. In this part of the show we turn to reluctant one-thingers. Our first witness, journalist Philip Weiss.",
    "Philip Weiss writes for the New York Observer and other publications, and he has spent a lot of time with the Clinton conspiracy theorists. These are the people who see a sinister force, who see one thing behind these events. The death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster in 1993, the raiding of Foster\u0027s office after his death, Travelgate, Web Hubbell and whether he was paid off to keep him from cooperating with prosecutors. Some also include on the list drug and gun running through the Mena airport in Arkansas during Bill Clinton\u0027s years as governor, various murders and deaths too numerous to list here.",
    "Well, as he did his reporting, Philip Weiss became persuaded by some of the one-thingers. He saw their logic, but he did not become a one-thinger himself. He spoke with This American Life senior producer Paul Tough. Philip Weiss says that before he first went out to meet the Clinton one-thingers, his year with him was fairly unambiguous.",
    "Philip Weiss is a novelist and columnist for the New York Observer. He spoke with This American Life producer Paul Tough.",
    "Act Five, Quitting Quitting. Back in 1994, Evan Harris quit everything in her life. Job her, boyfriend, her city. And she started to think about quitting as an abstract idea in and of itself. She started to develop a theory about quitting. She wanted to name the parts of quitting. And she started to publish a zine about quiting with a friend of hers. She\u0027s also published a book about quitting called, The Quit.",
    "The more Evan Harris looked around, the more it seemed like everything in the world was made up of quits and quitting. History seemed like a series of violent, elaborate quits by nations and peoples. People\u0027s personal lives seemed driven by a series of endings. Quitting became the lens, the one thing through which Evan Harris saw the world.",
    "That tape if from when I interviewed Evan Harris back in 1994. This is back when she made her big sets of quits. She was at the height of her quitting frenzy and her thinking about quitting. At the time she was trying to catalog still all the parts of quitting, the euphoria of the quit, the euphoria that you feel when you get a quit.",
    "Well now, Evan Harris has quit quitting. Three years after that. Or it quit her. She no longer is in the throes of one thing. I talked to her about it last week.",
    "Because the quitting streaming includes the idea of that when you quit you will feel good? That\u0027s almost like one of your definitions of quitting from back then.",
    "Right. And it wasn\u0027t just this theoretical quit.",
    "And so then the fever broke?",
    "When quitting was all you thought about, back when quitting was all you thought about, what was that like now that you look back on it?",
    "When I hear this, I just picture you just sitting down and just pouring these pages out, page after page, like in a dream. Like in a seizure.",
    "See, but what in your life today can compete with that?",
    "No, no, you were saying nothing.",
    "Well, you know, like do you miss having that faucet going full force all the time?",
    "And now you don\u0027t organize your thinking about the world that way. Now everything doesn\u0027t come down to one thing. Everything is kind of everything?",
    "Do you think that you lost something by now seeing everything in the world as everything and not just boiling everything down to one thing?",
    "What?",
    "Unified, you mean everything added up to one idea?",
    "Can I ask you what else what else have you lost by giving up that phase of your life when you really believed?",
    "You mean it stopped seeming so interesting?",
    "And so you used to see quitting as being the engine behind everything around us. Do you feel like that is the best explanatory framework with which to understand your life?",
    "You did?",
    "What was that?",
    "Picking?",
    "Meaning what?",
    "Well, I mean as you say that, I mean it occurs to me that this whole scheme is just the mirror opposite of quitting, really. I mean, it\u0027s just somebody picking stuff instead of somebody quitting stuff, right?",
    "Evan Harris.",

And her mom had officially declared that the period between Mother\u0027s Day-- which, of course, is in the middle of May-- and her birthday would be known in the family as \"gala time.\" Which meant, basically, it would be the one time during the year where mom would get whatever she wanted. Which would\u0027ve been fine except what mom often wanted was a road trip into the mountains on curvy roads, which didn\u0027t match Julie\u0027s personal style when Julie was a kid.",

If it\u0027s not the one person who gets sick in the car, it\u0027s the person who hates the sun; or the one who can\u0027t stand the beach; or the person who loves the beach-- loves it so hard, so fiercely so thoroughly that no one else in the family can understand it.",
    "There\u0027s a promise of summer, the hope we have of all things getting easier, of more fun, more free time. And then there\u0027s the reality of all we have to do to make summer live up to its potential.",

Usually, those who are familiar with the show know that we will choose one theme and bring you a variety of all different kinds of stories over the course of the hour. Today, we\u0027re going to hear two stories interlaced throughout the hour-- one from Ron Carlson, one from Scott Carrier. We\u0027ll hear those stories in a minute. But first, a little mood music.",

    "Well, Act One and Two. Most of our ideas about the start of summer come from school, from that moment when we would get out of school in May or June and feel that flush of freedom. Even as adults, I think we yearn for that feeling to hit us again come Memorial Day, come the start of summer. The first of these two stories that we\u0027ll be hearing interlaced throughout the hour is by Ron Carlson, a story of somebody on summer break from college. Ron Carlson is a writer who lives in Arizona.",
    "Ron Carlson. Let\u0027s start the second of the two stories we\u0027ll hear throughout this hour. This is a very different kind of summer adventure, one spent outside with nature. Scott Carrier, a frequent contributor to This American Life, decided to canoe down the Green River in Utah.",

One from Ron Carlson, a short story called \"Oxygen\" from his new book of stories, Hotel Eden.

It\u0027s Mike Myers and the blond from Baywatch, Pamela Anderson Lee, and the director of the Terminator films, James Cameron.

    "Thank you.",
    "Do you think that the way that he decided to approach you was a tip-off that that might have been?",
    "Yeah, there\u0027s a sign right there.",
    "Our next presenter, our next reader, Noel.",
    "Wait, humor verses what? Like attacks at people without gaps in their teeth? What would be other thing that you would do-- you would proselytize, try bring people over, encourage people to create gaps in their teeth?",
    "It was your very first time actually having sex with somebody?",
    "Well, as we looked for those stories from the net for this show, especially stories of things happened on that net might not happen anywhere else, we found Earl Jackson. He\u0027s an associate professor of Comparative Literature at the University of California at Santa Cruz. And he spends a lot of time on the net. He writes about the net, has seven websites himself. And he tells the story, which begins on America Online.",
    "Right, people would meet, go have sex.",
    "Oh, really?",
    "Wait, ultra-real sex, you said?",
    "God, do people still do that?",
    "Earl Jackson says that he meets more and more people who\u0027ve hooked up what amounts to video cameras on their computers. With a technology called CU-SeeMe, they can look at the person they\u0027re interacting with over the net.",
    "Come--",
    "Talk a little more about that. You actually know somebody who actually left an actual date--",
    "Oh, they left you?",
    "Kissing anybody at all?",
    "And so he says to you-- at what point in the evening did he say, \"I\u0027m going to go home now?\"",
    "Back in December of 1993, Earl Jackson met a guy over the net in one of these gay chat rooms. The guy\u0027s name was Ken, lived nearby. But he had a boyfriend. So the two never met in person. But almost every day for a year, they got online together and created these elaborate fantasies together online, using that kind of software where you can see what the other person types as they type it, and they can see what you type as you type it.",
    "You could tell even the way he was typing was different?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Did he send you a final note in the last package he sent you?",
    "It must have been so strange to see a physical manifestation of him after the email.",
    "After he died, did you go through a period of mourning for him?",
    "What a strange thing to be mourning somebody who you never actually saw.",
    "Because you hadn\u0027t had a high school boyfriend who you would do that with?",
    "It\u0027s funny, because it\u0027s almost like the whole thing, it could be a con, an elaborate con.",
    "After he died, you know how after somebody you were close to is gone, how when you go back to the places where you used to go with them, you\u0027ll think of them inevitably and miss them. After he was gone, when you would get back on your computer, would you sense his loss?",
    "Earl Jackson in Santa Cruz.",
    "So it was your first time just making out with somebody, and it was at Microsoft.",
    "His first million?",
    "For all the hype about the revolutionary changes the internet is going to bring us, what\u0027s striking about this particular story is how much of it could have happened without computers at all. All across America, teenage boys kiss young women on a date or two, then freak out and withdraw. All the computer adds is an air of mystery and intimacy and some exotic stage props for the drama. Otherwise, the lines and the moves are very, very old.",
    "Really?",
    "Like what else?",
    "The cad. At what point in the whole interaction did he promise you the Office 97, the free software?",
    "Did you just think, he\u0027s feeding me a lot of soup?",
    "Now, I\u0027m sure you can only look back on the incredible naivete. Some young man is prowling the streets of Seattle, walking through the U District, telling women--",
    "Well, the question we pose in this hour is, what is happening on the internet? And are there things happening on the net that never would have happened without it? Over the past few weeks, we\u0027ve advertised in cities around the country, inviting radio listeners to send us samples of their own emails, samples of things they\u0027ve found on the net that they thought were especially interesting or amusing. We have advertised here in Chicago, asking people to come here today, to the museum of contemporary art, with those samples. And over the next hour, we\u0027ll hear from people here and people around the country, an unscientific sampling of what\u0027s going on on the net. Stay with us.",
    "My co-host for today\u0027s show is David Hauptschein. Welcome, David. David is a playwright and novelist. His played \"Trance\" won the Fringe First Award at the Edinburgh Theatre Festival and was produced for the Brighton Arts Festival. His play \"The Persecution of Arnold Petch\" premiered this year at Red Orchid Theater here in Chicago. And years ago, David started having these shows that he called \"letter shows,\" where he invited people onstage to bring their mail to a theater and read it, just as kind of a big open mic. And we\u0027re adapting the format of those shows to the electronic media today. David, why don\u0027t you explain the rules of how one of these shows goes.",
    "Let\u0027s give a sample ding, so people know what to expect.",
    "There\u0027s a picture of the ball.",
    "Readers.",
    "Our next reader, Stacy.",
    "Tell us anything you think we need to know, or just start right in.",
    "You know what this is like? It\u0027s like one of those Christmas letters. How often does she--",
    "And for you, as somebody who knows her, when you read these, do you feel a sense of, yes, I must know, or is it, oh, no?",
    "Because now, you never have to say anything.",
    "Keep going. Finish your thought.",
    "I don\u0027t want to be a good friend.",
    "Once a month, it comes to you in a vision.",
    "Well, she doesn\u0027t listen to the radio, does she?",
    "Thank you.",
    "The JenniCam is on seven days a week, 24 hours a day. And the number of people who want to see what fascinating thing is going on in a college girl\u0027s dorm room each day?",
    "A half million hits, every single day. And what do people see?",
    "Our associate producer tuned in to your page, just to kind of see what was going on. And for about a half an hour, she witnessed you on the phone. Every three minutes, there\u0027d be another picture of you in a different position, on the telephone.",
    "In a way, it\u0027s hard to think of anything more banal than seeing a college student\u0027s dorm room.",
    "Let me ask you to talk about the nudity.",
    "But, you know, when I think about how often somebody is nude in the course of a day, it\u0027s really not very long.",
    "Explain what the thrill is about being naked in front of a computer camera.",
    "But wait. You\u0027re saying you\u0027re being naked in front of potentially a half million people, and it means nothing to you?",

    "I\u0027m Ira Glass, back next week with more stories of this American life.",
    "I can describe the furniture store in one word-- shiny. Shiny purple leather sofas, iridescent mirrored pictures of the sphinx, and King Tut, and panthers, chandeliers and ornamental elephants made of glass and mirror.",
    "We were staring at a bed with mirrored columns that rose from the headboard and lights built in around the baseboard. There was a mirrored chandelier, a matching white-and-mirror bureau and side table with gold-colored handles, all of which matched each other and matched the bed.",
    "So which parts of this do you like?",
    "She tells me her family\u0027s always rented. Her dream is to own a house, filled with furniture like this. We walked from room to room, looking at gaudy lamps, and cabinets, and chairs. And finally, Claudia turned to me and asked, \"So, which do you like best?\" and looked into my eyes.",
    "Now I grew up in the Jewish suburbs outside of Baltimore. I am no stranger to furniture like this. It filled the bright, lime-green, carpeted living rooms of a good number of the people who I grew up with and loved. I have personally had as many big moments in my life while sitting around glass-top tables with shiny, mirrored legs as anyone you have ever met. I\u0027ve had important conversations leaning on iridescent silver pillows, my feet on super long, white shag carpet. I feel at home in this setting.",
    "But-- and I say this meaning no disrespect-- I have not chosen this for my adult life. It is not my dream. So when Claudia asked, \"Which do you like best?\" I paused, and I said, \"I like the plainer stuff.\" And she looked at me, did not say anything.",
    "I think that this answer just did not make sense to her. My taste does not make much sense to her. She and I were in that situation, that situation that two people find themselves in now and then, that situation of thinking, \"Yeah, your dream, my nightmare.\"",
    "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a wide variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Your Dream, My Nightmare. Act One, Noise. A serious-minded music critic gets sent on her nightmare vacation to Rock-n-Roll Fantasy Camp. Act Two, Color, in which an interracial couple traveling through Tennessee cannot agree on one tourist destination, an antebellum mansion plantation.",
    "Act Three, Motion, in which radio producer Jay Allison decides that all the news stories he ever covers are essentially one story, one story whose theme is-- do we even have to tell you? Act Four, Blood. Some of the biggest your-dream-my-nightmare scenarios occur when parents try to impose their dream upon their children. Writer David Sedaris provides us with a case example on the golf course. Stay with us.",
    "Claudia Perez and I stopped into the store while we were working on a radio story in between interviews. We were on 26th Street in her neighborhood, Little Village, one of Chicago\u0027s big Mexican neighborhoods.",
    "And the piano table is all mirror.",
    "With glass legs on the glass table.",
    "Claudia is 19, has done a few stories for our radio show. She\u0027s one of those teenagers who\u0027s on a perpetual plan for self-improvement, switching from job to job, trying to earn enough to keep paying her way through school, struggling. She and I walked past the shiny living rooms, through the shiny dining rooms, and into a dark and shiny bedroom, where she stopped dead and said, \"Oh my god.\"",
    "Act One, Noise. Well, here is someone\u0027s fantasy. A cocktail party about 7:00 in the evening in an old hotel in Miami Beach, where, by the swimming pool, there\u0027s Bruce Springsteen, draft beer in hand, making polite small talk. Actually, it\u0027s not Bruce. It\u0027s his old side men, Clarence Clemons and Nils Lofgren. Oh, and there\u0027s Billy Joel. Well, not really Billy Joel. It\u0027s Billy Joel\u0027s drummer, Liberty DeVitto.",
    "This is Rock-n-Roll Fantasy Camp. It really exists. And this April, 33 campers got their dream, to come to the Eden Roc Hotel in Florida for five days, drink nervously through cocktail parties like this one, play nervously in celebrity jam sessions. All in all, for most of them, a dream come true.",
    "Well, Sarah Vowell has different dreams. Sarah is one of our contributing editors and a music writer for Spin, The Village Voice, and Salon. She dropped in on Rock-n-Roll Fantasy Camp.",
    "Sarah Vowell is the author of the book Radio On and a music columnist for the online magazine Salon. She first wrote about Rock-n-Roll Fantasy Camp for Request Magazine.",
    "And Sarah?",
    "You said at the beginning of your story that your own rock and roll fantasy is that occasionally, every now and then, a song you like would actually come on the radio.",
    "Indeed, I can, Sarah Vowell. What song would you like to hear on the radio?",
    "Why this song?",
    "Marvin Tate is a performer and a poet living here in Chicago.",
    "Coming up, David Sedaris on the golf course, the news story to end all news stories, and more, in a minute when our program continues.",
    "Act Two, Colors. Well, that feeling of your dream, my nightmare can happen with the people you\u0027re closest to, not just strangers. For instance, Marvin Tate was traveling with his wife, Lucy, and their two-year-old toddler, Ivy, to visit his sister in Tennessee. And they could not agree on what sightseeing they wanted to do.",
    "He wanted to go to the Ernie Tubb country music store. That is her nightmare. She wanted to go to the Belle Meade plantation. That was his nightmare.",
    "He\u0027s black. She\u0027s white. And he could just not understand what possible interest she could have in this. But she insisted.",
    "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week, of course, we choose a theme, invite a wide variety of writers, performers, and documentary producers to take a whack at that theme with radio monologues, original reporting, found tape, anything they can think of. Today\u0027s program, Your Dream, My Nightmare, stories of people simply not agreeing on what is good at some fundamental human level.",
    "We\u0027ve arrived at Act Three, Motion. Well, while putting this show together this week, I picked up one of the local papers here in Chicago, and I realized that nearly every story on the front page was a narrative basically along the themes of your dream, my nightmare. I have the paper here.",
    "The lead story is about the transit authority here in Chicago phasing out subway train conductors. Taxpayers\u0027 dream, saving $4 million a year. Train conductors\u0027 nightmare. Just below that story, a piece about Rupert Murdoch achieving one of his many dreams, I assume, making his own sports cable network. ESPN\u0027s nightmare.",
    "To the left of that, with a very odd, I have to say, picture of Hillary Clinton kind of holding her fingers together in one of those little church shapes, her fingertips touching, looking both pious and extremely nervous, there\u0027s a story about one of Kenneth Starr\u0027s dreams and her nightmares. She has to turn over notes of her conversations with lawyers to the Whitewater independent counsel, and so forth, and so on. You get the idea.",
    "Well, Jay Allison is a seasoned newsman, does stories for ABC\u0027s Nightline and for all sorts of big public radio programs. And a while back, he realized that all the stories he was doing basically boiled down to one plot line, told over and over in various ways with different characters. Someone, somewhere, had the dream of moving to a new neighborhood. And that dream was somebody else\u0027s nightmare. Well, after he figured this out, he took the taped interviews he\u0027d gathered on a number of stories, and he concocted this composite story to prove his point.",
    "Jay Allison\u0027s story is part of his series Life Stories produced with Tina Egloff.",
    "Act Four, Blood. Well, some of the biggest your-dream-my-nightmare situations happen between parents and children. One of the central tensions, I believe, between parents and their adult kids is the adult children not living up to their parents\u0027 dreams for what they should have turned into and who they should have been.",
    "In this light, thinking about our show this week, I realized this about my own family, that, when I was a kid, my mom had this dream for my older sister. She wanted my older sister to play the piano. My older sister was actually really wonderful at playing the piano. But my mom really thought she could be a professional.",
    "And my mom\u0027s dream for me was-- if she had to articulate it, I think she would have said-- and she did say sometimes-- that she wanted me to be a doctor. Neither thing really worked out. My sister went to business school. Here I am.",
    "And as it turned out, as my mom got older, she became a doctor. She\u0027s a psychologist now. And just recently, in the last two years, she started playing the piano, too.",
    "Well, not everybody is lucky to have parents who basically transfer their own dream back onto themselves and off the kids. One of those people is David Sedaris. He has this story of parents and children.",
    "David Sedaris\u0027s story \"Women\u0027s Open\" is from his new book of autobiographical stories called Naked. His latest play opens as part of the Lincoln Center Festival July 8. It\u0027s called Incident at Cobbler\u0027s Knob.",
    "Well, our program was produced today by Nancy Updike and myself with Alix Spiegel and Julie Snyder. Contributing editors Sarah Vowell, Jack Hitt, Margy Rochlin, and Paul Tough.

    "I\u0027m Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life.",
    "From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Our story today begins in 1865 and ends this year, today. The moment in 1865 where we start is on March 4, the day Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever read this speech, but it\u0027s this incredible document, just four paragraphs long.",
    "This is Chris, a senior at Lincoln Park the year I interviewed him. America\u0027s biggest experiment in integration, integrated schools, left Chris intolerant mostly because of tense, little interactions he used to have all the time with black students. Some of them were his fault, he said. Some theirs.",
    "Well, today on our program, four attempts at answering that question. Act One, Another Politician Has God And The confederate Flag. Act Two, Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln. Act Three, Good Blacks and Bad Blacks. A story by New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell. Act Four, Racial Cheerleaders. A story about somebody whose attitude about race did change. Stay with us.",
    "At the time that he delivered this, the Civil War was ending, over a half million Americans dead. And Lincoln uses the speech to ponder the question, why have we been visited with this war. Here are his words.",
    "\"Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude or the duration, which it already has attained. Each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God. And each invokes his aid against the other. The Almighty has his own purposes.\"",
    "And at this point in the speech, Lincoln posits this incredible image that slavery is a kind of original sin on this continent, an original sin for which all Americans must pay. He says, \"Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman\u0027s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with a lash shall be paid with another drawn with a sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, \u0027The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\u0027 With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we\u0027re in, to bind up the nation\u0027s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\"",
    "Well, today on our program on this Fourth of July weekend, we raise this question. How\u0027re we doing absolving ourselves of our original sin? To answer that, let\u0027s fast forward to the 1990s.",
    "This is Eliyahu Miller. When I recorded this, he was a sophomore at a Chicago high school named for Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln Park, in a rich neighborhood in Chicago\u0027s mostly white North Side. Eliyahu rode the bus for nearly an hour a day to get there from his home in a neighborhood on Chicago\u0027s mostly black, mostly segregated South Side. One measure of how far we have to go in healing the wounds of the past is the distance Eliyahu had to go between home and school.",
    "Act One, a modern politician, his god, and the Confederate flag. Well, not long ago, a governor of a southern state made his own attempt at binding up the nation\u0027s wounds and achieving a lasting peace among ourselves. And frankly, it has not gone too well for him.",
    "The governor was David Beasley of South Carolina. His state is a good place to examine how well the wounds of the Civil War are healing. It is the only state in the Union that flies the Confederate flag over its state House",
    "Our contributing editor, Jack Hitt, is from South Carolina. And this past Thanksgiving, he watched the television address where Governor David Beasley proposed that they remove the flag from the statehouse flag pole.",
    "At one point, I remember you described Ralph Reed as being \"sincerity challenged.\"",
    "In other words, it actually was a change of heart, and there was not much political advantage in it for him? He stood not to gain politically from this move?",
    "Well, good for him.",
    "Because of his stand on the flag?",
    "OK, so he comes on television and--",
    "Right. And this is the field called semiotics, a sort of very arcane, in a certain way, academic discipline, which has swept across academia in this country in the last 15 years. Frankly, not the kind of thing which appears in our American political debate very often.",
    "In fact, you\u0027ve written about this. I\u0027m going to read from your writing. You say, \"The speeches themselves were novel for their departure from the debate\u0027s old terms, flag is evil, flag is not evil. Rather, these speakers put forward nuanced arguments of semiotics, the science of symbols. And I don\u0027t mean they argued that the flag debate signified other issues beyond race. No, I meant that they were actually arguing semiotic theory.\"",
    "And so he\u0027s basically articulating what is the central tenet of modern semiotic theory which is that you have this object, a flag, and any meaning can attach to it.",
    "In other words, the flag has a meaning, and that meaning is stable.",
    "In other words, if the flag means honor, it\u0027s always going to mean honor. Other people can try to attach what they want, and it\u0027ll still mean that.",
    "One of the things that I find most interesting about this in light of Lincoln\u0027s second inaugural is that the second inaugural is essentially a Christian document. It\u0027s both a political document, and it\u0027s a document arguing about faith. What are we to make of this as people who believe in God? The fact that the war happened and so many people have died. And it\u0027s interesting that Beasley would also, basically, come to this conclusion that we need to heal, the same conclusion that Lincoln comes to, as an act of faith.",
    "So Jack, I know that you have your own modest proposal on how opponents of the Confederate flag flying over the statehouse might be able to actually get the flag off the statehouse.",
    "And it, in fact, is based on semiotic theory.",
    "Adopt the Stars and Bars as their symbol.",
    "Right. \"It\u0027s our South too.\"",
    "But in a certain way, looked at at the distance of a century and a quarter after Lincoln, how are we to view this entire debate?",
    "But I have to say, there\u0027s another way to look at this debate. And that is that the fact that this is what\u0027s being debated about race relations and the place of blacks and whites together in society, if this is what\u0027s being debated, that means that there are all these other things which we have not solved, which are never discussed with the same fervor and political heat. You\u0027re saying the governor of South Carolina is going to lose his governorship over this symbolic question of whether to fly a flag. He is not losing his governorship over whether black children are educated as well as white children.",
    "Jack Hitt\u0027s a magazine writer and a contributing editor here at This American Life. After he published his idea that blacks adopt the Stars and Bars, he discovered that two black entrepreneurs in South Carolina have a company called NuSouth that\u0027s trying to do exactly that. These two guys, Sherman Evans and Angel Quintero, have a full line of clothing that feature the Confederate flag rendered in the colors of African liberation, red, black, and green. They have a store on Main Street in downtown Charleston. They hope to expand to all 13 original colonies.",
    "Do they have a website? Well, of course. www.nusouth-- spelled N-U-S-O-U-T-H-- dot. com.",
    "Act Two, Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln. What to do with the symbols of a white supremacist past? Well, after the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln did not ban the Confederacy\u0027s national anthem \"Dixie.\" Instead, he had it played on the White House lawn, saying, in effect, we\u0027re all one nation, this song is all of ours. It\u0027s a strategy, I think, Nelson Mandela would understand.",
    "In fact, that story about Lincoln and Jack Hitt\u0027s story about South Carolina reminded me of a story that I had been told by a friend of mine named John Matisonn. John is from South Africa. During apartheid, he was the chief political correspondent at the leading opposition newspaper, The Rand Daily Mail. For a while, he was National Public Radio\u0027s correspondent in South Africa, which is how I know him. When Nelson Mandela was released from prison, John was the reporter given the honor of asking Mandela the first question at his very first press conference. Now he\u0027s a member of Mandela\u0027s government.",
    "And a few years ago, he told me about the Springboks. The Springboks are a rugby team. Under apartheid, rugby was the favorite game of South African whites. Now for blacks, the favorite game, the national game, was soccer. But for whites, it was rugby.",
    "And the Springboks were the national team, the team that would go to the international competitions, things like that. And it was all white or almost all white, with one or two black players. The Springboks were seen as a symbol of white South Africa and apartheid. When Nelson Mandela\u0027s party, the African National Congress, came to power, there was this big debate over whether to get rid of the team\u0027s name and its logo. A springbok is like-- it\u0027s like a deer. And just like the flag debate in South Carolina, John Matisonn says, the debate got very emotional.",
    "During apartheid, international sanctions had kept South Africa out of the World Cup. And so at the first World Cup game of the post-apartheid era, a game hosted by South Africa, Nelson Mandela settled this issue of the springbok symbol once and for all.",
    "If I remember right, back when it happened, you told me that grown men were crying in the stands.",
    "Nelson Mandela has systematically tried to diffuse the old symbols of apartheid, all of them, of their power. He traveled to formerly all-white neighborhoods. He made the old apartheid national anthem part of the new national anthem. At one point, Nelson Mandela held a lunch, and he invited the wives and the widows of all the prime ministers from during the apartheid era. And he also invited the wives and widows of all the black leaders from that era as well, including Steve Biko\u0027s widow.",
    "This actually leads to the thing I was going to ask you next, which was how important do you think these symbolic changes are in changing a nation? How important are they versus, say, building houses and getting the economy working in a different way?",
    "John Matisonn in South Africa. Coming up, Good Blacks and Bad Blacks, Good Whites and Bad Whites. That\u0027s all in a minute when our program continues.",
    "Malcolm Gladwell\u0027s story first appeared in the New Yorker magazine.",
    "From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers, and performers, and reporters to tackle that theme with original documentaries, radio monologues, found tape, anything they can think of.

For a perspective on how far black America and white America have come in integrating into one America, consider this story from New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell about his cousins who emigrated to this country from Jamaica 12 years ago, scrimped and saved to make a life here.",

    "It wasn\u0027t Amanda\u0027s dream house, it was her mom\u0027s. And it wasn\u0027t one you would usually think of as a dream house. 500 people living in a 10-story building, dorm style, right in the middle of the city.",
    "Amanda isn\u0027t happy at the Jesus People community, but she is the exception. Most of the teenagers living there actually seem to like it a lot. And like any good parent, Amanda\u0027s mom did consult with her about the move. Amanda even agreed to move. Though, the final decision wasn\u0027t really hers.",
    "From WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, we choose some theme, invite a variety of writers, and documentary producers, and performers to tackle that theme. Today\u0027s show, Dream House. Stories about parents who had some utopian vision for their family\u0027s future and who built their dream houses to try to realize that future.",
    "Act One, Meema\u0027s Adventure. In that act, a family dreams of life in rural Maine, moves there, and then, well, things start to get very complicated. Act Two, Blue Sky Dream. David Beers explains the gorgeous, modern vision that drew his parents and tens of thousands of other young families to California in the \u002750s and \u002760s to work in aerospace, and what happened when they arrived. Stay with us.",
    "Where they moved is an experiment in communal living that, at the time, had been going on for 25 years in Chicago. Nobody owns private property, everything is shared. The TVs, the cars, everything.",
    "If you need pocket change, you go to a room called \"the money office.\" And if they\u0027ve got cash, they\u0027ll give it to you. Remember, this is 500 people.",
    "And if all this is beginning to sound like a big socialist collective in the middle of a modern American city, let me add just one more fact to make this picture complete for you. The community? It\u0027s Christian. Run by a group called Jesus People USA.",
    "At 16, a year and a half after they first moved to this community, Amanda says that she doesn\u0027t think of herself as a Christian anymore, which, understandably, upsets her mother, who moved here partly so that Amanda would live in a Christian environment and learn Christian values. It\u0027s kind of a tense subject between them.",
    "In a way, this story is not so unusual. How many of our parents move somewhere, some dream house, some vision of a new life in a new place, moving the family with them, settling new suburbs, migrating because of layoffs and divorces, and just hoping that it\u0027s going to work out for the kids in the long run? Though kids, of course, are all about the short run.",
    "Meema Spadola\u0027s story about her family\u0027s move to Maine continues in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues.",

We continue with Meema Spadola\u0027s story about her parents\u0027 move to Maine, and what it did to their family.",
    "Act One.",
    "In 1976, Meema Spadola\u0027s parents decided to move from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where her father was a math teacher, out of the city to build a house in Maine. It turned out to be a pivotal and redefining change in all of their lives. Meema prepared this story about her family\u0027s move. It\u0027s partly the story of her parents\u0027 dreams and partly a story of her own.",
    "Meema Spadola is a documentary filmmaker living in New York, an hour subway ride from where she was born.",
    "Act Two, Blue Sky Dream.",
    "That\u0027s David Beers reading from his memoir, Blue Sky Dream. Ronald Reagan built his family dream house by funding the strategic defense initiative, Star Wars. David Beers\u0027 father was an aerospace engineer. And back in 1957, after the Russian satellite Sputnik scared the nation into a new defense industry boom, Beers\u0027 family joined tens of thousands of others who went to work in aerospace in northern California. Beers\u0027 father worked at Lockheed on secret defense projects through the Cold War and the Vietnam War.",
    "Those these days the suburbs get criticized as a place of sheer materialism, Beers writes that it was not materialism that was attractive to his family when they moved out to the California suburbs. It was the emptiness of the place. It was the fact that you could create new, modern lives out there, hopeful lives, crafting new traditions.",
    "He writes that, at one point, his mother actually decided that the family was Irish even though, really, they were only one-fourth Irish.",
    "So she\u0027d just select the parts she liked?",
    "Can I ask you to talk for a minute ago about how you saw your dad when you were a kid? In your book, in your memoir, you describe him in scene after scene as showing up with lumber, and building stuff, and laying down new brick walkways, and building a deck behind the house, and constantly having one project after another. You write at one point, \"There was nothing my father could not do himself apparently.\"",
    "Well, you\u0027ve agreed to read a long excerpt from your book, Blue Sky Dream. You write about in the book what you call your \"tribe,\" the aerospace workers and their families, moving into a valley that was first known as the Valley of Heart\u0027s Delight, building a home in a brand new subdivision with the Old World name Clarendon Manor.",
    "David Beers\u0027 memoir is Blue Sky Dream.",

    "This story of voyeurism, innocent voyeurism, starts off simply enough. Pete was supposed to meet a friend when she got off from work. He arrived two hours early.",
    "Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it is This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose some theme, bring you documentary stories, original fiction, radio essays, anything we can think of on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Other People\u0027s Mail, stories of people reading stuff they\u0027re not supposed to see in the first place, and how it moves their hearts, and what happens after that.",
    "Act One of our program today, Dead Letters. Richard Lyons walks through a car junkyard and finds in the crumpled up wrecks letters and notes of the people who once lived in these cars. Act Two, Thief. A college girl steals other people\u0027s mail. Mona Simpson reads an excerpt from her short story. Act Three, Saviors. A visit to the only post office employees who are allowed to actually read your mail. These are the people who deal with letters whose addresses are unreadable or incorrect or nonexistent. They open up the mail to try to get it to where it\u0027s supposed to go. Act Four, Voyeurs, in which our own Sarah Vowell picks a fight with me. Stay with us.",
    "On this particular day, Pete found a big bag of letters, maybe 100 pieces of mail, written over a year and a half. He\u0027s excited. It seemed like hours of reading.",
    "Here\u0027s the picture that emerged as he put this puzzle together. The woman lived in another country. The guy lived in the United States. And while visiting her country, staying in a hotel there, he slept with this woman once. She wanted to see him again, idealized him, wanted to come visit him. But none of these trips ever seemed to happen. Pete only had the letters that she had written, her side of the story. But sometimes in her letters, she repeated things that he said.",
    "And over the course of the correspondence, all sorts of things happened. This woman went to jail, and then lied about it to the guy, and then finally admitted the whole thing. She lied about a daughter of hers. She actually said that a daughter of hers had died. And then finally admitted, no, no, I was just lying about that. And over the course of these letters, this woman slowly puts her life in order. She goes to school, she gets a new job, often taking advice from the guy.",
    "As he read, Pete started to feel protective of this woman. The guy seemed to be sending mixed messages. The guy, to him, seemed like a total jerk, really. He was always making her think that he might want to see her, but then he would always quash any plans that they had to actually get together. And this is the thing about reading other people\u0027s mail, as you read you cannot help but read between the lines. Anybody with any heart, any half sense of empathy fills in the details that are missing. You\u0027re thrown into this world that\u0027s part fiction writer and part detective.",
    "Act One, Dead Letters. Well, Richard Lyons is in the band Negativland, which is known for using a lot of found sound in their recordings. And a couple years ago he put together-- he xeroxed just a couple copies of it for a few friends. And it was made of these objects he had found, letters and notes. It\u0027s really this incredible document. When you open to any page, what you see is, on the right side there\u0027s a photo of some smashed up, demolished car. And on the left, there\u0027s a letter or a shopping list or some note found inside that totalled car. He agreed to tell the story here. All the names and certain identifying details have been changed.",
    "Richard Lyons is in the band Negativland. His xeroxed book of crashed car photos and text isn\u0027t available anywhere. But the band is posting some of it on their website, if you\u0027re curious. The address of that website, www.negativland.com. And you spell Negativland, N-E-G-A-T-I-V-- no E there-- L-A-N-D.",
    "[MUSIC - \"STEALING PEOPLE\u0027S MAIL\" BY DEAD KENNEDIES]",
    "Act Two, Thief. While there can be consequences to reading other people\u0027s mail, a friend of mine told me this story about his first job. In this job, he was a reporter at a small newspaper in a small town, and they had a basic office computer system. And then one day on a whim, he tried to log in as the owner of the newspaper. For the password, he just typed in the name of the guy\u0027s grandson. It worked. He suddenly had access to every file in the newspaper\u0027s computer, every story, every accounting record, every email.",
    "My friend says it was miserable. Most of the mail was depressingly banal, not worth reading. The main thing that he learned was that at the beginning of the year, nearly everyone in the office had gotten a bigger raise than he had. Reporters whose stories he thought were terrible had made much more than he did.",
    "When you open other people\u0027s mail, things can happen, unless you\u0027re careful. With that in mind, we turn to Mona Simpson. She\u0027s the author of numerous books. This is an excerpt of a short story she wrote a few years ago, called Lawns.",
    "Novelist Mona Simpson, reading an excerpt from her story, Lawns. Coming up, postal employees reading your mail and bending the rules for you, yes, you. That\u0027s in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues.",
    "Well, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we pick some theme, invite a wide variety of writers and performers and documentary producers to take a whack at that theme. Today\u0027s show, Other People\u0027s Mail, how it grabs your heart, whether you want it to or not.",
    "We have arrived at Act Three of our program, Saviors. If you work for the US Post Office, opening and reading other people\u0027s mail is actually one of the worst things you can do. You can be fired, investigated, imprisoned, unless you work at a Mail Recovery Center. There are three Mail Recovery Centers in the United States, in Atlanta, Sacramento, and St. Paul. Mail that cannot be delivered through any other means ends up there. There it is opened for a good cause, to look for clues to get it to you. Paul Tough visited these mail saviors in St. Paul.",

Well, back in 1945, Walt Strommer was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge. He was permanently blinded, sent home.",

A father and a son go on a long car ride to figure out what parts of the father\u0027s brain have not been lost yet to Alzheimer\u0027s disease and to try to jump-start his memories. Act Two, My World Record, a hemophiliac\u0027s adventures at motocross racing and at setting another world\u0027s record. Act Three-- well, just stay tuned for Act Three. We\u0027ll launch Act One after some music.",
    "In fact, he realized, in his dream, he was always able to see. And even to this day, over 50 years later, he still has these dreams from time to time.",
    "Mr. Strommer says it took 10 or 15 years of blindness before he showed up in his own dreams as a blind person. And at some point, he started to wonder, \"Why the delay?\" He wrote a letter to a publication called Paraplegia News asking if anybody else had the same experience. He got a handful of letters from people who had.",
    "Here\u0027s a letter that you were sent. An older man writes, \"I\u0027ve been in a wheelchair since October 6, 1966. And during the dream state, I\u0027ve never visualized myself in a wheelchair. I\u0027ve been impotent since 1962, but in dreams, I see myself as a stud that can go out with any of the cute, young things.\"",
    "One man, a wheelchair user, wrote, \"This is better than just a harmless fantasy. It means I can re-experience walking and running temporarily. I wake up mentally refreshed, at ease.\" Mr. Strommer was a college professor, and he spent some time researching why our subconscious minds would take so long to absorb the new facts about our lives, why his brain took a decade to admit to itself in dreams that he was blind. He says nobody really knows why. It might be chemical, or it might simply be that it\u0027s common for us all to see ourselves one way when in reality we\u0027re not that way at all.",
    "Act One, Road Trip. Joel Meyerowitz is a photographer, grew up in New York City. But for the last two decades, his parents have lived in Florida. Joel would see them, visit for a few days at a time. But over the past 10 years, Joel\u0027s father, Hy, developed Alzheimer\u0027s. Before he retired, Hy was a salesman for 40 years and did a few years as a comic in a vaudeville act before that. He was a boxer, won his weight class in the very first Golden Gloves competition. But now that he had Alzheimer\u0027s, the doctor said that he should stay inside, avoid a lot of stimulation. His son Joel thought, \"What if we try, just for a brief time, something different?\"",
    "They got a camera and went on a three-week trip, driving from Ft. Lauderdale back to New York City. Joel Meyerowitz\u0027s son Sasha did most of the filming. You hear his voice only a few times in the footage I\u0027m about to play you. When they set out on the trip, Sasha was 27, Joel was 57, Hy was 87.",

    "Act Three, Iron Man. All of our stories today have been at one level about yearning briefly fulfilled. And we thought this last story would be a perfect way to end this show. Mark O\u0027Brien is a writer living in California, but because of a childhood case of polio, he lives most of each day in an iron lung, on his back. He\u0027s the subject of the documentary film Breathing Lessons by Jessica Yu. The film is remarkable because it\u0027s about a guy in an iron long, but it is completely unsentimental. There are even parts where it\u0027s funny.",
    "This is a brief scene from the film. Because he\u0027s in the iron lung, Mark O\u0027Brien has attendants. They cook and they help him out during the day. And during the film, he explains that nowadays he always has men do this job. Because back when he had women do the job, he kept falling in love with these women, and the love was never reciprocated. He wrote about one of these women, \"Her pale, perfect skin, her strong, fleshy legs drove me to ecstasies of despair. See, she talked to me as a human instead of her savagely crippled employer.\"",
    "A quick warning before I play this very brief scene. It contains mild sexual content that may not be suitable for every listener.",
    "[IRON LUNG RESPIRATION]",
    "Usually Mark O\u0027Brien can\u0027t be outside of his iron lung for more than 45 minutes. But when the sex surrogate was with him, he was outside his tube for longer than that, longer than he almost every goes out. And he didn\u0027t even use his portable respirator.",

One\u0027s white, one\u0027s black. And they went there because there\u0027s something about South Africa for them and for many Americans, something familiar and unfamiliar at the same time in a way that makes it mesmerizing.",
    "Now, of course, the situation is reversed. Once Nelson Mandela got out of prison, and especially after he entered the president\u0027s office, it\u0027s been black Americans who look to South Africa for inspiration. A few years ago, I did a series of stories for National Public Radio with a South African reporter, comparing race relations in the US with race relations in South Africa. And one of the most striking differences between the way that blacks in the two countries saw things was blacks in South Africa, they said they had hope.",
    "Of course, it isn\u0027t just black Americans who look to South Africa to see a place where things are changing, where things are getting better in small ways. Today, we\u0027ve devoted our entire program to the story of two guys who look to South Africa that way. Their names are Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson. Both of them grew up in the normal morass of post-civil rights race relations in this country, went to schools that were integrated but where blacks and whites usually stayed separate, rarely mixed.",
    "So they headed to the new South Africa for a few weeks. And it turns out they did not agree on what they saw there. What we bring you today is partly a story of the emerging multiracial society over there and partly a story about the one here at home to contemplate this 4th of July weekend. Rich starts our story.",
    "Robert Kennedy described this congruence of nations as well as anybody. In 1966, he was visiting South Africa. And he began a speech at the University of Cape Town this way--",
    "That stunned pause before the audience begins applauding, I think that\u0027s so beautiful. More than England or France or Israel, more than Canada or Japan, when we think of South Africa, it is a more interesting mirror of the United States than nearly any country. I think because we glimpse a distant echo of the most frightening parts of our own country and the most inspiring parts.",
    "In the 1950s and \u002760s, black South Africans looked to the US for inspiration. Lewis Nkosi lived in Sophiatown. He remembers reading American literature like Langston Hughes\u0027 Simple Speaks His Mind.",
    "\"Harlem was like our neighborhood,\" Lewis Nkosi says. Black South Africans in Sophiatown listened to Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, tried to dress and talk like Lena Horne and Cab Calloway. In Sophiatown, gang members modeled themselves after Hollywood movies, dressed in zoot suits, picked up phrases from tough guy films like Street with No Name.",

But today, we\u0027re devoting our whole show to just one story about South Africa\u0027s emerging multiracial society and about America\u0027s.",
    "If you just tuned in, Rich Robinson and Josh Seftel are best friends. One\u0027s black, one\u0027s white. Rich is a New Yorker. Josh is from Boston. They traveled together to the new South Africa not long after Nelson Mandela took the president\u0027s office to meet some people who Josh thinks might be distant relatives of his and to see what\u0027s changed since Nelson Mandela began his experiment at creating a multiracial society, and what hasn\u0027t changed.",
    "Josh Seftel is a documentary filmmaker who made the film Taking on the Kennedys. Rich Robinson works for a business consulting firm. After coming home to the United States, he moved to Brazil for six months on business. Alone.",
