    "For the next year or so, when I was back home going to college, I would dream that I was driving a car. And then in the dream I would think, \"You shouldn\u0027t be doing this. You\u0027re blind.\"",
    "Sometimes I will dream of myself as I was as a teenager. And those dreams are almost completely as I would have been then, seeing. Or occasionally, I will still, in dreams, see a page of a book and read it, and absolutely clearly, and I may even remember a sentence or two when I wake up.",
    "Some of them started seeing themselves as in wheelchairs or paralyzed-- whatever-- within a few months. Others it was years before it was incorporated. And I think almost all of them say it\u0027s inconsistent. Sometimes they will see themselves as in a wheelchair, the next time not. I think one of the more amusing ones was the man who said he would go along in his wheelchair and he gets to a curb that the chair won\u0027t get up on. So he gets out of the chair, lifts it up on the curb, and then he gets back in and goes on his way. Or one woman wrote about she will dream that she\u0027s walking with her husband, and he\u0027s pushing her wheelchair. And then he sees somebody coming. He says, \"Quick, get back in your wheelchair. People are coming.\"",
    "Yes. That comes through in a couple of the letters. And as I recall, one of the people wrote-- I guess I had raised the question, why doesn\u0027t the dreaming brain catch up and show you the reality? And she said, \"Why should it? Why should it be in a hurry to show us the unpleasant side of life? Maybe part of the function of dreams is to give us a few minutes of respite and happiness so we can come out of it and say, \u0027Hey, that felt pretty good.\u0027\""
