    "And we\u0027re very unique. First of all, we\u0027re one of the few white families that\u0027s got a black child in the family. I mean, I\u0027m the aunt of this-- and not many Jewish families have got black children. In fact, I don\u0027t think there are any other Jewish families. And there\u0027s one family, but they adopted the black child.",
    "Her main boyfriends were black.",
    "But that was the-- often you won\u0027t find, she doesn\u0027t criticize much, but she did say that the blacks, the boyfriends were not faithful. They had lots of women. And even the man that she\u0027s had the baby with, he\u0027s got a child. But I hope that he\u0027s faithful to her.",

    "I mean, you changed the attitude of students towards black people. And he was--",
    "Yeah, but your daughter was an activist.",
    "Yes, \u002786, when we went to Israel, that\u0027s when she stayed and moved in here with the ANC.",
    "We are guilty to the extent that--",
    "We lived through the apartheid years. We didn\u0027t take up arms. We benefited. But in our own little way, we kind of contributed. I know that Harry--",
    "What else could we have done?",
    "The government was so oppressive.",
    "We could have done what the Firsts did. What Ruth First did. She went to jail. And her family was destroyed. But we didn\u0027t want that."
