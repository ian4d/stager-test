    "They promised us money. They promised us jobs. There\u0027s nothing that ever have happened like that.",
    "They bring us electricity first. Why not water first? Why didn\u0027t they ask us \"What thing do you want first?\" Are we going to eat electricity? Are we going to drink electricity? Where are we going to get money to buy this electricity if we are not employed?",
    "What I should do-- all those white men\u0027s area, white men\u0027s toilet, I\u0027ll do it upside-down. If this was the black man\u0027s toilet, then that is the white man\u0027s toilet. I\u0027ll take the whites there and tell them to come here in black men\u0027s toilets and then I\u0027ll write \"Whites only.\" Yeah? The only thing maybe that should be the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].",
    "It\u0027s in the blood now. It\u0027s in the blood.",
    "The blacks, if they see a small boy of white meat, they think that small boy of white meat is-- I forgot-- is bigger than them. And they\u0027ve got money, and they\u0027ve got whatever. We always see ourselves as inferior as [? what we ?] [? have told, ?] the doctor and the system of [? his. ?] That thing will not end."
