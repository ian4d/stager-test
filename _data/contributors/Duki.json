    "Yeah? Hey, Ira, how you doing?",
    "Long time no see.",
    "So what\u0027s going on here? You got a whole bunch of celebrities on tonight?",

    "Yeah. Because she has this kind of-- it\u0027s a prominent nose, you know what I mean? It kind of sticks out. And you just want to squeak it. Like over Thanksgiving, we were watching The Muppet Show, and Miss Piggy was on. And she reminded me a lot of Nielly.",
    "Mm-hmm. Yeah. And Kermit told Miss Piggy, \"Move the pork.\" And so I was telling Nielly to move the pork all week.",
    "Yes, she would. She would.",
    "You know Nielly. You know how she looks at you when she doesn\u0027t approve of something you say or do? She gets this kind of ice-cold stare, and she gives you this side long glance that makes you feel like you\u0027re about the size of a pea?",
    "That\u0027s what she does. She not as critical of me.",
    "No, not really. I\u0027m kind of an unusual duck. I\u0027m not really in touch with the whole duck scene, you know?",
    "When I had time, I used to migrate once in a while, because I had some friends who are ducks. And I try to keep in touch with them. But lately, I\u0027ve just started spending more time with people and doing my own thing. And I just don\u0027t have time to do those duck things anymore. I just wanted more in my life than that.",
