    "We don\u0027t know that, Louis.",
    "This is where we live. This is our milieu. There\u0027s a wonderful park here.",
    "OK, now in this house-- let me show you-- in this house, this lady was attacked. They jumped over that fence and beat her up. I\u0027ll show you where another person was murdered.",
    "In this bush here, the people squat. Anywhere where there\u0027s water, the homeless squat.",
    "When my daughter Louise was here, there was a ring at our intercom. And I looked through the window, and I said \"There\u0027s one of these squatters.\" I said, \"Don\u0027t open the door.\" She says, \"Tsk, Mommy.\"",
    "So she said, \"Yes?\" He said, \"Please Madam, please. I want some bread.\" So I said, \"Don\u0027t give it to him because he\u0027ll send hundreds here. And your mother will be killed. And leave him alone. He\u0027ll go and tell the others. You don\u0027t give him anything!\" So I had just baked some bread, I made sandwiches. And I said, \"Louise, I\u0027m warning you. You\u0027ll find your mother dead.\"",
    "But she went on, and she put lettuce and tomatoes and cheese. And I said, \"Louise, he\u0027s going to tell all the others. And you\u0027ll see. It\u0027ll be terrible. Leave it. Don\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t do it.\" And she walks up to the gate, and he says, \"Oh, Madam! God bless you.\" And she said, \"And don\u0027t you ever dare come here again!\" And he jumped back. And do you know what? The next day they were ringing again.",
    "And you know how we used to live before? We had no fence. Nobody had fences.",
    "We Seftels are unusual.",
    "Yeah. And we\u0027ve got many stories. Well, I suppose Harold told you-- I don\u0027t want to go over it-- his association with Mandela. Did he tell you?",
    "Did you hear the news today about this new gang that\u0027s going around? They\u0027re raping young women.",
    "I\u0027m always looking at myself in the glass in the windows. And as I look, I see two tight-buttoned young men jump out of the shadows. And so I jumped into the street. And they followed me. They grabbed my bag. And they were pulling me along the ground. And I was screaming. I mean, I had every sound coming from me. I don\u0027t know where it came from.",
    "And they must have been doing this for about three minutes, when coming towards us was an elderly white couple. They must have been in their \u002770s. And the man pulled out a gun, and he shot the one on this side of me. And I said, \"And him too! Him too!\"",
    "Well, it was total euphoria. Our family got on a plane and we flew to Cape Town and we stood in the square and waited for Mandela to come. And we waited and waited and waited and waited. And in the meantime, in the-- and it got hot as Hades. My friend who was with me, she was punched in the stomach and her camera was stolen. It was an enormous crowd of people. And they were crushing you and crushing-- eventually, you didn\u0027t have any space to breathe. And we must have been there for about six hours when we decided we must get out of here, because we began to fear for our safety. It was that sort of encroachment on our territory. And this is what\u0027s happening now.",
    "So that\u0027s what we\u0027ve become. We\u0027re not a threat to anybody. We pay our taxes and timidly tiptoe through the land, hoping nobody will mug us.",
    "No, I didn\u0027t feel guilty.",
    "No, guilt\u0027s the wrong word for us. We don\u0027t feel guilty.",
    "No such word."
