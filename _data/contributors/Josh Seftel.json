    "Even though Louis seemed to have some problems with the ANC, Harold knew Mandela, Lisa was in the ANC, Molly was protesting in the streets. As far as I was concerned, my family passed the test. My fear that they would be a bunch of white supremacists was put to rest and I felt relieved.",
    "I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t quite understand what was tangibly so harsh about--",
    "Back at the hotel, we talked about dinner.",
    "It\u0027s almost like you don\u0027t want to like them.",
    "You honestly believe that most white South African families are more liberal or as liberal as them?",
    "I\u0027m not taking that away from you.",
    "You want to fight more? Hm?",
    "I guess I\u0027m saying that-- I don\u0027t know. I mean, I was pleasantly surprised that they were less racist than I could ever have expected.",
    "Rich needed a break from my family. So when Molly came to pick us up for breakfast, I went alone. She gave me a driving tour of the neighborhood.",
    "We drove through peaceful, leafy neighborhoods with big houses. But almost every house was surrounded by a high fence and barbed wire. One neighborhood had a manned checkpoint to keep people out who didn\u0027t belong. Another had armed security guards patrolling the tree-lined streets on bicycle. We drove past an area that looked like a golf course with a neatly manicured lawn. And right by the curb, half-hidden by the shrubbery, were maybe half a dozen black people, sitting and laying on the ground.",
    "That\u0027s amazing, because this looks like a very well-off neighborhood, and right on the edge, there are squatters.",
    "We were back at her house. She pulled her car up to the big gates and punched in a code. Metal doors slowly parted and we drove in.",
    "We rented a tiny Volkswagen and set out to see more of the new South Africa. We drove for hours over green, rolling hills. The deeper we got into the country, the fewer and fewer white faces we saw. Every so often, we\u0027d see a cluster of pink and aquamarine huts on a hillside, a village. Finally, we stopped at one.",
    "One of the guys had an old accordion out on the car seat. I asked him to play a song and he did. \"A Roman hymn,\" he told us.",
    "On the way out of the village, we ran into three teenage village girls. One of them wore a thick layer of white face paint, like a mask. She said it was for pimples. We were talking, and they were teaching us how to say hello in Xhosa. And then the girl with face paint turned and looked us over. She looked at Rich\u0027s skin, which was a few shades later than her own. Then see looked at mine, which was a few shades lighter still. Then she looked at both of us. \"Are you brothers?\" She asked us.",
    "I had another reason for wanting to visit South Africa. I had just gotten a letter from some South African guy named Benzion Seftel asking if we might be related. My family\u0027s very small. Besides my parents and two sisters, there\u0027s only a few Seftels in all of North America. I guess I was simultaneously excited and scared. I mean, it\u0027s not every day that the size of your family suddenly doubles.",
    "But when they\u0027re white South Africans, all these questions pop into your head, the first and most obvious question being, \"So do they hate black people?\" I mean, what do you do when your family doubles in size but the new half is a bunch of white supremacists? I decided not to share any of these worries with Rich.",
    "Yeoville\u0027s a party. The street is lined with outdoor cafes, people are wearing Nike T-shirts, New York Yankees hats, all kinds of American stuff. The scene is just like the magazine pictures. Blacks and whites talk together and drive by us in BMWs and Mercedes. When Rich and I go into a convenience store to get a drink, there\u0027s a tall black man wearing a Public Enemy T-shirt in the corner. He\u0027s playing Pac-Man.",
    "I\u0027m white.",
    "Standing over by the pay phone, his girlfriend was plump and rosy in an African print jumpsuit and a red cashmere Kangol beret.",
    "Do think that Yeoville is maybe one of the best places right now because it\u0027s mixed?",
    "What\u0027s that?",
    "What does it say?",
    "Your girlfriend just paged you from across the room?",
    "What\u0027s your girlfriend\u0027s name?",
    "Mary. If you came into this store five years ago with Mary-- a white woman, black man-- what would have happened?",
    "You would have been dead eight years ago?",
    "Why? What would have happened?",
    "Dimitri, the owner of the Pita Palace.",
    "A lot of white people are leaving?",
    "You\u0027re going to leave soon?",
    "Over the next few days, we would hear Dimitri\u0027s story over and over. Wherever we went, people talked about crime and fear and whites leaving. That night when we walked home through the dark streets of Johannesburg, we found a shiny bullet shell on the pavement. We took a cab the rest of the way home.",
    "[RUNNING WATER]",
    "About what?",
    "Going to see--",
    "[ELECTRIC RAZOR]",
    "--the people that I think are my relatives. That\u0027s why I\u0027m shaving.",
    "Well, I\u0027ve talked to them on the phone once-- twice.",
    "I can only hope so.",
    "Not really. I mean, it could be interesting.",
    "I\u0027m just afraid that they\u0027re going to be racist and they\u0027re going to hate you because you\u0027re black, and that you\u0027d never forgive me for it.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "So here we are with my long-lost family. Sitting around a big table piled with lasagna and fresh baked bread, are Harold Seftel, his sisters Dolly and Molly Seftel, Dolly\u0027s son Louis, and Rich and I. They reminded me of my relatives back is Schenectady.",
    "Now, Uncle Borach is which person here?",
    "That\u0027s Louie, the little boy in the picture?",
    "And then Uncle Borach is him?",
    "Oh, really?",
    "There\u0027s something about meeting distant relatives so far from home. There\u0027s this immediate bond that\u0027s basic and powerful, this feeling like you\u0027re all players on the same team, even though you\u0027ve just met. But at the same time, mainly because Rich was there with me, I was nervous and wanted to know what the people around the dinner table had done during apartheid.",
    "It\u0027s embarrassing to think about now, but I asked them repeatedly to talk about those years. At first, they were reluctant to discuss it, but finally they did. I was relieved to find out that Harold, a tall, lean, 60-year-old with squinty eyes, not only knows Nelson Mandela, he\u0027s one of his doctors. After Mandela came out of prison, he invited Harold and his kids for lunch. During apartheid, Molly was active in a group called The Black Sash, which picketed outside the court buildings.",
    "It turns out, Harold\u0027s son David used to drive around giving medical care to black activists who were too scared to go into the state hospitals. Harold\u0027s daughter Lisa is a member of Mandela\u0027s party, the ANC. She was arrested and imprisoned for several months during the struggle and had to go into hiding underground for years. For a while, Lisa\u0027s Aunt Dolly and Dolly\u0027s son Louis, who are less political, let her stay at their house.",
    "Boer.",
    "Boer. I am a Boer.",
    "That means I don\u0027t like you.",
    "Do you think we\u0027ve seen a lot of Boers?",
    "I guess I don\u0027t-- I\u0027m not looking for Boers. I only notice it when you say it.",
    "Which didn\u0027t bother me, as long as Rich wasn\u0027t looking for my family to be that enemy.",
    "That\u0027s good. That\u0027s good.",
    "Do Boer.",
    "We had read about a place called Rustler\u0027s Valley in our guidebook. It said that Rustler\u0027s was one of the most progressive places in the country, maybe on the continent, a kind of ongoing South African Woodstock. When we got there, there were lots of hippie-looking people with long beards, toting aboriginal instruments and bongos. The horticulture there looked like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. On one hillside, it looked like someone was holding a VW van convention. On another hillside, we joined a group of people who were in the middle of experiencing \"a sound journey.\"",
    "They all sat in a circle with their eyes closed and their legs crossed. In the middle of the circle was a man with a bunch of instruments. He was blowing on a didgeridoo. When he stopped, they went around the circle talking about how the sound journey had made them feel.",
    "Down by the river, it was like Eden. There were people swimming naked and horses drinking from water and running wild. A group of two women and two men were passing around reefers the size of small cigars. But most of the action at Rustler\u0027s took place around a giant, flaming globe. At night, hundreds of kids danced to techno music in the firelight. Next to the dance floor was a pool where nude swimming was encouraged. There was a room called The Passion Pit, with low couches, dim lighting, and intertwined bodies. There was the tepee village. Rich and I went down there and ran into this guy wearing moccasins, knickers, and a feather headdress. He rolled a joint and talked to us about Rustler\u0027s philosophy.",
    "Back in the States, I almost never notice race. But since I\u0027d been in South Africa, I found myself noticing it whenever Rich and I walked into a room. I\u0027d look around and think, are there any black people here? I worried he\u0027d be uncomfortable.",
    "Do you feel like they\u0027re treating you differently than they\u0027re treating me as a white person?",
    "I don\u0027t know.",
    "In the morning, the sound journey people were at it again. They sat cross-legged in a tight circle with their eyes closed. And when the man in the middle swirled his didgeridoo around the head of an entranced, red-haired woman, a steady stream of spit splattered onto her forehead and her eyelids. She didn\u0027t seem to notice. As we were driving out of Rustler\u0027s, someone approached the car and gave us a bulging sandwich bag full of marijuana and a bumper sticker. It said, \"Pot will save the world.\"",
    "PAGAD is famous for their method of getting people to just say no. They go to a drug dealer\u0027s house, pull him into the street, and set him on fire. There had been an incident like this six month earlier. A drug dealer had been burned to death in the street. And PAGAD felt their part in the incident had been misrepresented in the press. Their legal adviser, who had been quiet until then, explained PAGAD\u0027s side.",
    "5,000 people. As I sat there imagining what I would do if 5,000 people showed up at my doorstep, the legal adviser turned to us.",
    "Where was I?",
    "As I fumbled for an answer, [? Tohfi ?] explained how drinking, naked dancing, nightclubs, and abortions are all destroying the new South Africa.",
    "[PRAYING]",
    "I get the sense that when you meet a white person here, you make the assumption that they\u0027re racist until proven innocent.",
    "I mean, that\u0027s what you said before. I\u0027ll play the tape for you a little bit later. But you did say that.",
    "Back in Johannesburg, my cousin Louis took us on a tour of his latest masterpiece. Louis is an architect.",
    "Well, let me ask you this. Why do you put so many breast shapes in your architecture?",
    "Who are those guys in the rain by the fire?",
    "Where do they live?",
    "On the cement floor?",
    "Is it nice in there?",
    "Wait, can you say that again?",
    "On this last visit to Johannesburg, we stayed with my family at Dolly\u0027s house. And this time, they really felt like family. Late one night after Rich went to sleep, I talked with Dolly in the kitchen about the ups and downs of my love life. She urged me to marry a Jewish girl. It was just like talking to any of my relatives.",
    "When I first got to South Africa, I had been more willing to judge Dolly and the others. But now that I had seen more of the country, I didn\u0027t feel that way anymore. I guess at some level, it just didn\u0027t feel right to judge family in the same way that judging your parents harshly for having different opinions than you do doesn\u0027t feel right. But Rich wasn\u0027t so sure.",
    "I don\u0027t feel skeptical of my family, my relatives here. I think you do. I think you feel a little bit skeptical of them.",
    "So do you like the Seftels or do you not like the Seftels?",
    "But?",
    "They\u0027re still rich and white--",
    "--at the end of the day.",
    "I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s too hard to know. I mean, there\u0027s so many variables. I would hope that I would have been involved in some way. It\u0027s like, how can you guess what you would have done? You never know.",
    "On this visit, they seem more beleaguered than anything else. They told us about all their friends who\u0027d been robbed and attacked. Molly explained how she\u0027d been mugged at knife point.",
    "Not long ago, Molly had been famous and powerful. She was an actress who had been in lots of plays and a few films. She was the first white actress to appear on stage with a black. Her husband Monty had been a politician and had served as the mayor of Johannesburg during the \u002770s. But he died a few months before we arrived. Now she lived by herself in a big house with a big wall surrounding it. She was alone, except for her black servants.",
    "One of the turning points in her life as a South African, one of the moments that changed her from an activist into the person she\u0027s become, was the day that the Seftels had waited for for years, the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison. The day started off just fine.",
    "And they\u0027re scared. I mean, they\u0027re scared in their own homes.",
    "Now, most of the young people in the family are leaving. One of Molly\u0027s children has emigrated, and one of Harold\u0027s. And another of Harold\u0027s sons is probably leaving soon. Harold told me that in 15 years, there will be hardly any Seftels left in South Africa.",
    "Even at this last dinner, even getting along with them as well as we were, there were still things about my South African relatives we didn\u0027t completely understand. And it might have been impolite, but we just asked them over and over. What did they do during apartheid, if they felt guilty?",
    "What\u0027s the right word?",
    "So that was it. Now that we\u0027re back in the States, Rich and I never really talk about what happened in South Africa. I guess we\u0027ve said everything there is to say to each other."
