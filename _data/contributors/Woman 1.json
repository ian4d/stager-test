    "Oh, yeah. I met her. She was very nice. She was really, really nice. But I thought she was a little bit ditzy. And when I found out when she was missing and I read the article in the New York Times. No, the New York Post and it said that she was working on a documentary and all this stuff. I was thinking, it\u0027s terrible that she didn\u0027t seem that smart to me. Not that she wasn\u0027t smart, but she seemed a little ditzy and she didn\u0027t seem that mature. Then I found out she was 36 and I was surprised.",
    "Thought she looked really nice. Whenever I seen her I thought she was very striking because she was so pale skinned and her hair was so white without looking phony. Most girls with white hair, it just looks bleached, it\u0027s phony. It looked very natural on her. Whether it was real or not, I don\u0027t know.",
    "Somebody told me that her family pretty much thinks that she must be dead because she hasn\u0027t popped up yet and she would never leave her son. And they were saying maybe they should put it on Unsolved Mysteries. Maybe they\u0027d find her then.",
    "Are they going to? When is it going to be on?",
    "Wow. That would be great. Maybe something will come of it.",
    "That\u0027s crazy. That\u0027s embarrassing. I think they\u0027re embarrassing, the Charlestown High cheerleaders.",
    "Because they don\u0027t cheer like your regular cheerleaders anyway. They cheer like jigaboos or something. I don\u0027t know. Carol, that is not cheering. It\u0027s boge. They\u0027re like clapping, and singing, and getting down with their cheers. It\u0027s not even--",
    "It\u0027s jive cheering. Yeah.",
    "See, my sisters wouldn\u0027t cheer for Charlestown High because of it. I can\u0027t even think of a cheer that we could compare it to other than \"How funky is your chicken.\"",
    "And they do like [CLAPS AND STAMPS]. Oh, you want to just slap them and say, \"Stop, you look so foolish.\"",
    "Nobody\u0027s excited to have \u0027em. Everybody just wished they\u0027d go away.",
    "Dearest Jack, if you love me as much as you say you do, will you please spend time with me and the baby? You said you\u0027d take care of me and I don\u0027t know what I should do to make you keep your promise. I love you, Jack, and I hope you\u0027ll forgive me for not being able do some things good enough. But I want you to at least be here for all of us. And I hope you can see my point. Will you please come back? Love, Erica.",
    "If Jack doesn\u0027t want to be with me or Max, he can do whatever he wants. I don\u0027t care if he wants to do crank and everything else to get high. I can find someone who will be better for me and I know will be around at least sometimes and care about me and us both.",
    "It was an amazing experience. I actually still feel quite out of my body, really. And thank you for creating the space to help me let go. I\u0027m just feeling incredibly emotional.",
