    "Rick? Rick is an artist.",
    "Not what?",
    "You\u0027re a doll. You\u0027re my best number one!",
    "You make money. I\u0027ll tell you what, I\u0027ll give it to you straight off the street.",
    "What\u0027s what?",
    "What\u0027s your most attachment?",
    "Your profession. Now I\u0027ve got to figure out-- I don\u0027t know. Crook or thief or whatever. You\u0027re known as an artist. Serious artist in the art field.",
    "Judy?",
    "Stevie? I don\u0027t know.",
    "Well, I\u0027ll tell you, yeah. I see them-- \"Hello, goodbye.\" And that\u0027s it. I\u0027m not complaining.",
    "Joel? Is it my Joel? Don\u0027t you know who I am? Who? What do you mean, \"How come I\u0027m on the phone?\" Don\u0027t get mad at me. Don\u0027t get mad at me. It\u0027s very important because I\u0027ve been traveling. I didn\u0027t--",
    "Yes, I\u0027m OK. No, I\u0027m not having a good time. Are you having a good time? You are, really? OK. I want you to be healthy and strong and smile, Sally.",
    "Don\u0027t go down the judge\u0027s because right now I\u0027m beginning the first one of Joel\u0027s tests. And I will be back at home maybe-- who knows? A couple of months from now. I don\u0027t know, Sally. Would you go with me the next trip? Would you go with me the next trip? OK. All right, May. Take care, sweetheart. Be careful, will you? Be careful. Bye bye.",
    "She\u0027s mad. She\u0027s mad about something. Mad about me. I didn\u0027t do nothing.",
    "She\u0027s mad, that\u0027s all. She sounded very, very mad. She sounded like she didn\u0027t care.",
    "Oh, sure.",
    "I waver also when I think of her being by herself. And I would rather be there than be here.",
    "Yeah, to my limit, I\u0027m having what I like and I would love to do, love to be involved with. But the idea is that I always have to include Mama.",
    "Sally? Did you leave Sally upstairs there?",
    "No kidding. Right. Because I noticed right here that this is no Sally. I thought this was Sally all bundled up and I see it\u0027s that bundled up.",
    "Well, I\u0027ll be honest with you, Joel. I don\u0027t remember. Not the Catskills Ocean--",
    "Yeah, yeah. The pillow.",
    "Oh, you guys are starting to pull tricks on me now. I know, I know, I know. Well, is she here?",
    "Jesus Christ almighty. I know she\u0027s not in the trunk. You wouldn\u0027t do that to her. I\u0027m not able to come to this, Joel. I\u0027m not the smartest and the cutest and the swiftest. I--",
    "[LAUGHTER]",
    "If my Mommy--",
    "If my Mommy don\u0027t come up and then don\u0027t come down in five minutes, I want to know where she is. This is my wife.",
    "Oh, the bed is in the trunk?",
    "I wouldn\u0027t be surprised.",
    "You can see better with this.",
    "Good morning to you!",
    "Hiya, Sonny.",
    "Well, I don\u0027t know.",
    "I don\u0027t really know.",
    "[LAUGHTER]",
    "Uh, I\u0027m not-- I don\u0027t have to call my attorney?",
    "No. OK.",
    "But will you-- I\u0027m just going to say. Don\u0027t ask me about anything I did.",
    "Why? Because that\u0027s gone, man.",
    "Not that-- it wasn\u0027t so many things going on. But I just don\u0027t remember. It\u0027s jumbled. I\u0027ve been to a car. I went to the automobile. I\u0027ve been to the train. I was going in every direction. And I was losing sight. I was losing sight for no reason whatsoever. Everybody was going around us. Turmoil. Turmoiled.",
    "To moil?",
    "To moil is not to moil, but to moil is to have and to kiss and to love, to moil!",
    "\"Respect the old man who--\" wait, wait. I can wear glasses.",
    "Yes? OK. \"Respect the old man who has forgotten what he learned from a broken table-- from a broken table tablet. Have a place in the urk--\"",
    "I will take that as Pacific.",
    "\"Ark. Ark. Besides the tablets of the law.\"",
    "\"Repsect the old man who has forgotten what he has learned. For broken tablets have a place in the mind-- in the ark, excuse me-- the ark besides the tablets of the law.\" Didn\u0027t I have my glasses here?",
    "I wanted to try it.",
    "The Talmud?",
    "With my glasses.",
    "Take--huh?",
    "All right. Because I thought maybe--",
    "All right. \"Respect the old man who has forgotten what he learned.\" [CLEARS THROAT] \"For broken tablets have a place in the ark besides the tablets of the law.\" The Talmud. It was a little skimpy.",
    "It was a little skimpy, a little jumpy.",
    "Maybe so.",
    "Wrong.",
    "All right.",
    "I don\u0027t have a-- I don\u0027t have--",
    "Yeah, but maybe he\u0027s cock-eyed--",
    "OK.",
    "Yes. \"Respect the old man who has forgotten-- been-- who has forgotten what he learned. For broken ta--\" only one thing. It was still shaking, my eye. That\u0027s why I was loose.",
    "No. Take 11.",
    "\"Repsect the old man who has been forgotten, what he learned. For the broken tablets have a way place in the ark besides the tablets of the law.\" The Tablund-- Talmud. Ah, twice I made a mistake.",
    "Well, I-- now that I know what I was doing--",
    "Yeah, yeah. An economist, yeah.",
    "Yeah, wrong.",
    "Yeah. Well, this one, I imagine, would have to be. Because this is the Talmud.",
    "It just ended.",
    "I was trying to fit in myself, through all the years with the joking. I was trying to be a Chaplin. I didn\u0027t know if I was doing that right or wrong, but I saw that poor little guy, that he bent down, picked something up, everybody\u0027d give him a kick in the ass. That was what I used to see. That is what I didn\u0027t want to happen to me.",
    "He was a giant in the height of a little midget. He was a little guy, went righting all the wrongs, helping others as he passed by. We\u0027d pat him on the top of the head. He was remembered out there, just for a minute. He\u0027d have a little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] with a little person hat and no money or no nothing. And he would go inside and he\u0027d come out here like this. Like, shake his shoulders, and then travel around.",
    "And that was what I loved, the goodness, the goodness. And not everybody understood him. But those that understood him, they would put their arm around him and he would do the same with them. It was a beautiful deed for the day.",
    "Always. [CHOKING UP] Always. Always.",
    "When anybody would show a little bit of something to me that I was accepted, and they would talk to me, and they\u0027d pat me on the top of the head of put their hands around me, I\u0027m home. I loved everybody. I loved everybody. But nobody saw me. Nobody remembered me. Nobody knew me. Nobody saw me. But I was there. To this very day, I have the same fear. I have poor Mommy, I have. And she doesn\u0027t see me. She doesn\u0027t see me.",
    "You saw me. You saw Papa.",
    "It\u0027s the permiss- permission of--",
    "The Permishic!",
    "I am a bissel farshimmelt! What are you asking me so early in the morning a question like that?",
    "1-0-9-2-- 1-0-9-2-0-7-- no. 1-5-9-0-5-9 East--",
    "Yeah. Yeah.",
    "Here we come, baby. And I want you to know-- hey you!",
    "[BIRD CHIRPING]",
    "Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!",
    "What?",
    "No.",
    "Oh, yeah.",
    "I didn\u0027t think of the name at that time.",
    "Yeah. Sure I remember him.",
    "He was a little Chinese little bird.",
    "A parakeet. Right. I didn\u0027t think--",
    "He called us, he spoke to us, and he also called his name out a lot.",
    "\"I\u0027m Mel-- I\u0027m Melvin!\" Isn\u0027t it, isn\u0027t it, \"Hi, Belvin?\"",
    "Melvin Belvin?",
    "Oh, yeah.",
    "[LAUGHTER]",
    "I can\u0027t tell you about-- look at this. I can\u0027t tell you about any-- look at this. Another one comes. Hiya, boys! Hello! Hello! We know you! We know your grandfather!",
    "Yeah. Yes.",
    "I know it. It didn\u0027t but that--",
    "Oh, yeah.",
    "Yeah.",
    "No.",
    "Come on! You don\u0027t want to go? Don\u0027t fall! Take it easy, take it easy. Do you want to go?",
    "Yes?",
    "About our family?",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Joel, Ricky--",
    "The youngest one is-- I think it was David. I don\u0027t remember the name anymore.",
    "Joel, Ricky, and-- yeah.",
    "Stevie. Oh, yeah.",
    "Well, he tries to do a lot of stuff for you. If he were following me, he would be doing it on the crook. But--",
    "Ricky? Well, in the first place, he\u0027s my kid. You are also. And because that alone gives you enough fame.",
    "Ricky? Rick is a half-time, or part-time book-- I don\u0027t know the trade names.",
    "Don\u0027t you know who I am? Who? What do you mean how come I\u0027m on the phone?"
