    "We know from Joseph, our servant. He\u0027s from Malau. He has worked for us for 35 years. And Joseph would tell us that every day he would cook for them. And he would bring them meals. And he would serve them as they were writing their newsletters and their propaganda.",
    "But she would always say that the blacks in the ANC were always--",
    "That\u0027s a great story. During that year, because she needed a place to hide, we said that she could stay here and she could run whatever she wants to here. Because it was safe, it was suburbia, it wasn\u0027t where the activists hang out in Yeoville. So this was a great cover for her. So she stretched out and she spread out by the pool. All the ANC communists just laid out by the pool.",
    "I love round shapes. And I built the plan of this house in the shape of a big breast with the fireplace being the nipple, three-dimensionality thrusting through double stories. We can then have a look at this anthropomorphic, habitable woman!",
    "There we are. So here, have a quick view at this round facade over here. OK.",
    "Well, I\u0027ll tell you why. People have an immediate response. I\u0027ve taken people into my breasts, and they are so moved, and they are so stunned. They can\u0027t quite work out why they like these spaces. But they like these space because they feel hugged and encompassed by them.",
    "By the fire, these are workers. Traditionally in South Africa, the workers live on site. These guys--",
    "They live here. This is where they live.",
    "Yeah, they live on the cement floor, and they are the builders of the house. They\u0027re casuals, laborers, they\u0027re semi-skilled, they\u0027re bricklayers and blasters and stuff. And they come to-- and what\u0027s great about it is they\u0027re using the house in the way the house is meant to be used. Except, I\u0027d like them to put the fire inside there, in the fireplace where it was meant to be.",
    "But let\u0027s go into the lounge. This is the great lounge. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening. How are you? Good. We have a reporter here from America. He\u0027s going to tell a wonderful story about this house. Anyway--",
    "And here are the servants\u0027 quarters. They have their own little suite and yard.",
    "Beautiful. Lovely main bedroom and bathroom and kitchenette. Very nice.",
    "Absolutely. Servants are here in Africa to stay forever. And in fact, we must make them very nice because maybe, in a couple of years, we will move into the servants\u0027 quarters and the servants will move into the house. So you must always make them very nice.",
    "What I\u0027m saying is that there was in the bylaws of the old South Africa a law that your servants\u0027 quarters had to be very small and minimum-sized, and they had to have very high windows not overlooking a public space. Now servants\u0027 quarters are being made more luxurious and they\u0027re more like a little kind of garden cottage, granny flat kind of thing, because we might have to move into them one day and rent the house after the servants."
