    "I\u0027m now 21 years old, right? And what I did was I decided that I have to leave this country.",
    "I can\u0027t raise my children here. There\u0027s too much crime. And they\u0027ll just break into your house, take your stuff, and go. They come into your house, they break in, they rape your wife, they shoot you, and totally destroy your life. Kind of like the black people are taking revenge on the whites for apartheid, you know? Someone got around and said, \"Oh, let\u0027s drive them out of the country.\" And it\u0027s working, because every single year, the emigrations are going up.",
    "Yeah. Didn\u0027t you know that? Thousands, thousands. I know of hundreds of families that have emigrated this year.",
    "As soon as I can, yeah."
