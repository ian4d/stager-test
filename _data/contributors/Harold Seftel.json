    "At the end of the day, what did we do? I mean, it\u0027s not that we rioted in the streets or that we--",
    "I would not-- I worked in a black hospital. And look, I suppose I did a little bit of good--",
    "But I can\u0027t really describe myself as an activist. Let\u0027s be honest.",
    "Yes, but my children. I think I would say my children.",
    "Yeah, there\u0027s one family, and it\u0027s a family that has perhaps a greater commitment to South Africa then, say, the average white family. And that, I think, is a microcosm that tells you what\u0027s happened.",
    "I didn\u0027t feel--",
    "No.",
    "I think, disappointment, perhaps.",
    "Oh, no. We\u0027re guilty in the other way. But not because--",
    "I mean, the fact of the matter is--",
    "No, but the critical point is--",
    "No, but now, let\u0027s make this point.",
    "But the important point is the fact that we\u0027ve stayed, we made a contribution. Surely, the fact that we were here and helped to teach and to educate and to treat the sick and so on and so forth. That was surely far better than being in Boston. All right? We weren\u0027t activists. Absolutely right. But while we were here, surely we were making a contribution which we could never have made in Boston or in New York."
