    "I hired a sex-surrogate in-- \u002787 or \u002786. I forget when. I just-- felt very crazy. I was-- angry at all women for not falling in love-- with me, because I had fallen in love with several-- attendants. And they-- all said it was a business rela-- tionship.",
    "A sex surrogate\u0027s a person who has some of psychological training that-- works with their body, having sex with a client who\u0027s recruited by a therapist. The surrogate had this big mirror and she-- saw me naked and aroused. And-- at the time, I thought I was the ugliest man in the world. I looked just like something someone-- wouldn\u0027t want to have sex with.",
    "And Cheryl was very kind to me. She kissed me on the chest after-- we had intercourse. I felt my-- chest was very unattractive, but-- she kissed me right there. And-- the intercourse was so quick, it just-- I hate to say it, but it was wham, bam, thank you ma\u0027am. And it-- wasn\u0027t as great as I thought it would be, but-- being naked in a bed with a woman who\u0027s being extremely friendly was the-- most fun I\u0027ve ever had. I think I\u0027d like to do it again.",
    "I didn\u0027t need it for an hour. I went for-- an hour without it. It makes you think of sex as respiratory-- therapy. Maybe Medi-Cal would pay for it. About a year after I last saw her, I just felt terribly depressed. I expected somehow that seeing the surrogate would change my life. I had started wearing cologne. And I thought everyone would be able to tell if I was sexy and handsome.",
    "Nothing happened. They tell us to think of ourselves as-- sexual and beautiful, but it doesn\u0027t do any good-- unless someone else sees us as sexual and beautiful. You just can\u0027t demand love. You-- have to be lovable, and-- I\u0027m still trying to figure out how to do that."
