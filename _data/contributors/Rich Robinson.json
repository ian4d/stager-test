    "I felt uncomfortable. Dolly and Louis got this nervous, self-congratulatory tone when they talked to me about some of this stuff.",
    "It was just one of those situations where you never forget you\u0027re the only black person in the room. After eating, Louis took us on a short tour of their estate. We saw their expensive bedrooms, pools, Jacuzzis, and finally, tucked around the back of the house, was the servants\u0027 quarters, which consisted of a tiny main room with four beds and a closet-sized bathroom. One worker was in the room at the time watching a dim black-and-white TV. Beside his head on the wall was a photocopy of a game board.",
    "Louis told us that this was a lottery game. If you picked the right square, you won the pot for that week. I asked him who played. He pointed to the servant and said in a patronizing tone, that all of \"them\" do. The servant shook his head to say that he did not play, but Louis repeated that \"all blacks played.\"",
    "Later, there was this awkward moment-- awkward for me, anyway-- when Dolly and Louis were talking about Harold\u0027s daughter, Lisa.",
    "Well, I don\u0027t know how she meant it, but that sweeping statement about what all blacks are like, all blacks are unfaithful, that did it for me. That let me know who they were.",
    "I\u0027m saying I went over to that family and I felt tension because of a reason. That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying.",
    "Are you serious?",
    "It\u0027s just the first time that I had seen white settlers talking about blacks and their domestic help and who they keep around. And it was just I didn\u0027t realize how even the most liberal whites aren\u0027t necessarily the most-- they\u0027re proud that they have Lisa in their family because that way they can say that they are, in fact, the most liberal whites.",
    "Pfft. I\u0027m serious. I did not go in there not wanting to like them. But I definitely felt tense. And I didn\u0027t know why I felt tense. And I started to feel bad, and I started not wanting to be there. You missed it, though. When you left the room and it was just all of us in the room, we had nothing to talk about. They didn\u0027t want to talk to me at all. I mean, there was noticeable silence, and there was nothing going on.",
    "No! See, I didn\u0027t say that. I said exactly what I said. I went and I saw and that was the reality and I felt, and that\u0027s what happened to me. Period.",
    "OK.",
    "I can\u0027t fight about what I feel.",
    "Well, did you hear what I\u0027m saying? You\u0027re saying that because they were less racist than we thought they were going to be, that\u0027s good. And yes, that is good. But I\u0027m still allowed to be upset about it. And I am, in fact, upset about it.",
    "And you know what it\u0027s like? It\u0027s exactly like America. There\u0027s an underlying tension, and people want to be friends and all of that. But on the underside, they\u0027re all just [BLEEP] dicks.",
    "Crime has gotten worse since the end of apartheid, but it\u0027s not as big an increase as most people think. Since 1994, the murder has actually dropped 14%. Car thefts have dropped. Home burglaries have increased only 11%. The biggest increase in crime is non-residential robberies, which is up 50%, and rape, which is up 36%. What\u0027s happening is that crime in the white areas is now becoming the same as it\u0027s always been in the black townships.",
    "Josh and I weren\u0027t getting along so well since the fight in the hotel room. In the 10 years we have known each other, we had never really fought before. So we decided the best thing for our friendship would be to get away from his family and out of Johannesburg.",
    "There\u0027s a group of guys about our age sitting in an old car seat next to one of the huts. They looked like they were waiting for something to happen. They didn\u0027t seem happy with the new South Africa.",
    "All three men were unemployed. For Wayne, a tall, thin man who covered his shaved head with a black fedora, told us that the new government had finally brought electricity to the village just that week.",
    "They invited us into their shebeen for beers. They asked us questions about America, about our girlfriends, about the federal system, how we liked people at the office. They told us a story about why black men\u0027s noses are flat and white men\u0027s noses are long. They asked me if I was a relative of Michael Jackson. And they complained about the new South Africa. Wayne said if he were president, he\u0027d enact a much more radical redistribution than Nelson Mandela has.",
    "But doesn\u0027t hatred breed more hatred?",
    "Sitting in the shebeen, Josh and I were more relaxed with each other. There\u0027s nothing like a little talk about apartheid to make you forget your personal problems.",
    "For these guys, the new South Africa was a lot like the old South Africa. They were still without water and work, and they still felt powerless. Apartheid had done more than just separate the races. It had created a lasting sense of black inferiority.",
    "It was my idea to go to South Africa. I\u0027d met this South African guy at work. He told me that South Africa is the most beautiful country in the world and that everything you see on TV about it is wrong. I asked Josh to go with me.",
    "Josh and I met 10 years ago in college. We ended up living in the same house, and we\u0027ve lived together off and on since then. Josh is the son of a Jewish doctor in the suburbs. I grew up in the city. My parents are public high school teachers. He\u0027s white, I\u0027m black, but none of this has ever been an issue. Before this trip, I don\u0027t think we ever had one serious talk about race.",
    "We both wanted to see the new South Africa, to see how much the country had changed since Nelson Mandela took power two years ago. We decided to begin our search in a neighborhood called Yeoville. The free magazine they give you on the plane had an article about it. Lots of glossy pictures of blacks and whites laughing together in the streets, drinking together in bars and clubs, eating together in restaurants.",
    "[CLUB MUSIC]",
    "We call it \"black\" in America.",
    "It was our first day in South Africa, and it seemed like everything you\u0027d want it to be, everything you\u0027d dreamed of for the new multiracial society. Blacks and whites together, Pac-man, and personal pagers. We went to the Pita Palace for a celebratory souvlaki, and there, our celebration was cut short.",
    "You excited?",
    "What are you doing today?",
    "So how many times have you talked to them?",
    "Do you think they\u0027re shaving right now too?",
    "Are you nervous?",
    "Well, what if you don\u0027t impress them?",
    "So you\u0027re going to have a little anxious energy?",
    "Josh looks a lot like Louis. It was easy to believe they were related. Nevertheless, we spent several long hours around dinner trying to prove it.",
    "Say \"Boer.\"",
    "Say it.",
    "What does that mean?",
    "Actually, yeah, we have. On dirt roads, the dudes driving cars with the buzz cuts and crazy-looking eyes, tanned skin. Don\u0027t you think those are Boers? Don\u0027t you think they look like that? The little buzz-cut guy?",
    "The fact is, I came to South Africa hoping to confront real racists. In America now, racism is like this cloud that\u0027s still surrounding us, but you can\u0027t touch it or see it. You just feel it when you go to a party or when you go into a store. But in South Africa, white oppression officially just ended two years ago. I came here thinking it would be like seeing what it was like during the bus boycotts in the \u002760s or during the Civil War. I came here looking for the enemy.",
    "Boer.",
    "Boer. I can\u0027t do it.",
    "Boer. Boer.",
    "We had somehow wandered into a techno version of America in the \u002760s. But if America\u0027s \u002760s were about rebellion, it wasn\u0027t clear from anyone we talked to who or what, exactly, Rustler\u0027s meant to be rebelling against. In the smoky bar near the dance floor, we met the founder of Rustler\u0027s. He\u0027s 40-something with a pony tail, beard, and an African wrap that covered his hairy legs to the knees. His name was Frick. He explained the enemy.",
    "So the American government was the enemy, and the solution was the ethnic peoples. The only problem was, there were no ethnic peoples there. In a country made up of Zulus, Ndebele, Sotho, and Xhosa, a country with 12 official native languages, besides the kitchen workers and occasional gardener, I was the only black person at Rustler\u0027s. Josh and I did a little informal survey. Why no black people?",
    "Rustler\u0027s Valley wasn\u0027t really a part of the new South Africa. It was more like a theme park for recreational drug users, a summer camp escape for young, white South Africans where they didn\u0027t have to think about the crime rates or the futures in this country. After two hazy days, when we finally got back into our room, we found a young, blond-haired woman sprawled across one of our beds rolling a joint in the bedspread. It was 5:00 in the morning. We\u0027d had enough. We asked her to leave.",
    "Oh, yeah. Sure. Don\u0027t you think?",
    "It\u0027s that expectation. I walked in the main room. They had a couple people behind the desk. And two or three people were hanging out. And they were having at least two conversations, possibly three. You know, different groups of people. Not many people, six to eight people. And I walked in the room, closed the door, and everyone\u0027s quiet. Literally, I mean, come on. Two or three conversations didn\u0027t just happen to end at right the exact same moment I walked in the door. But you know, I open my mouth, I say a couple words, I make a joke, and it lightens everything up for them, and they feel, \"OK, that\u0027s all right. That\u0027s cool.\"",
    "But I only am able to do that because I know that if I prove to them that I\u0027m from out of the country, then they\u0027ll feel comfortable again, like they\u0027re not having-- like, it\u0027s something that they can feel cool about. Every time I see somebody, I try to talk and make witty jokes so that it\u0027s easier.",
    "In a mosque in Cape Town, we met a group called PAGAD, short for People Against Gangsterism And Drugs. They\u0027re a little like that group DARE that we have back in the States, except instead of soccer moms, these guys are Islamic fundamentalists.",
    "[PRAYING]",
    "It was time to return to Johannesburg to say goodbye to Josh\u0027s family and then escape from South Africa. We had been getting along fine since we left the Seftels two weeks earlier. No fighting. But now, with only four hours of highway between us and them, the tension returned. I was driving. Josh and the microphone were facing me. They had me cornered.",
    "I don\u0027t think whiteys here are automatically racist.",
    "Well, I\u0027m sure that I did not say there are active or inactive racists and there are not two categories. And we can replay the tape as many times, Mr. Seftel, as we need to.",
    "It\u0027s a two-story house still under construction. It doesn\u0027t really look like a huge breast. It\u0027s just got lots of curved walls and curved ceilings and a lot of breasty ornamentation.",
    "It was hard to dislike Louis. He was such an entertainer, I don\u0027t even think he took himself seriously. In our time in Johannesburg, he took us out, offered to lend us his car, invited friends of his over so we\u0027d have people to meet. The more I spent in South Africa, the harder and harder it was for me to tell the good guys from the bad guys.",
    "But there were still times I didn\u0027t know what to make of people like Louis. For instance, camped out in the middle of a half-built house in the rain were at least a half dozen black men who had built a fire in the middle of the living room.",
    "He showed us the kitchen and the bedrooms and the living room and a small servants\u0027 quarters attached to the side of the house.",
    "That\u0027s going to be a mainstay of Africa then. Servants forever.",
    "Well, I mean, how couldn\u0027t you? They\u0027re rich, they\u0027ve got bad-ass houses, they\u0027ve got servants, you know. It\u0027s like people living in the South that still have domestic slaves. I mean, I guess it is a job for somebody, but it just gives you bad reminders of what it was and what was.",
    "I think they\u0027re good people, and I\u0027m glad we had a chance to meet them.",
    "But--",
    "Yeah.",
    "At the end of the day, when the chips are cashed in, they still all have servants.",
    "Do you feel like if you were here, you would have done more or less than-- what position would you be in in the Seftel family, if you were here? Do you think you would have gotten involved in the struggle, or--",
    "Another day, another dinner with Josh\u0027s family. Our goodbye dinner. The conversation revolved around a few ongoing obsessions.",
    "The new South Africa wasn\u0027t working out the way they expected. They complained that since the ANC took power, the mail service is horrible, there\u0027s litter in the streets, the government\u0027s corrupt.",
    "It\u0027s been several months since we\u0027ve been back and we haven\u0027t had a single fight."
