The movie theaters are kind of dirty places. But there are people out there who wash their hands hundreds of times a day. And what separates me from that person?"

The one thing I kept thinking about though is, to me, obsessions can sometimes take the place of religion in people\u0027s lives. An organized religion gives you certain rules, certain rituals, by which to live your life. Things will be orderly if you follow those rules.

And we\u0027d been going for days and nights. And it had got really steamy on this train. And it\u0027s kind of a seedy atmosphere. And everybody was playing cards. All the time, playing cards and smoking.",
        "And then suddenly, this fight broke out. Like, out of nowhere. First, it was just these sounds. It was, like, really muffled sounds. Bodies colliding and ricocheting down the corridors and stuff. And then these kind of muffled shots.",
        "And we pulled the door across our compartment, and this body kind of rolled over, rolled past, stumbled past. And there was blood just smeared all over the glass. And you couldn\u0027t see anything because of that. It\u0027s like the sounds and the vision, and everything was muffled.",
        "But it took hours and hours before we reached the next town, and we\u0027re going through this small desert. But when we eventually got there, the train stopped. And there was this scene kind of took place in absolute silence. It was extraordinary. No one seemed to speak. And it was incredibly hot and hazy. And there was just this desert all around.",
        "And they took the body off the train. And then the guy who\u0027d killed him was taken off with handcuffs. And these few cops appeared from nowhere. And it was just like this platform in the middle of nowhere. I mean suddenly, out of the silence, this scream came. It was just like something between a wail and a scream. And it\u0027s like it just went right through the whole landscape.",
        "And it\u0027s like the dust sort of settled in the air as the scream kind of just hung there. It just seemed like for ages. I don\u0027t know if I can do that scream. I can hear it really, really clearly. I\u0027ll try, but I think it won\u0027t be like that. Anyway, it was something like this. [SCREAMING]"

        "Looking back on it now, I think maybe those moments in the snow were when my OCD began, although it didn\u0027t come to me full-fledged until my mid-20s. OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder, and some studies say over three million Americans suffer from it.",
        "Some mental health professionals claim that the onset of obsession is a response to an underlying fear-- a recent trauma, say, or a loss. I don\u0027t believe that that is always true. Because no matter how hard I think about it, I remember nothing unusual or disorienting before my first attack.",
        "I don\u0027t know exactly why at 2 o\u0027clock one Saturday afternoon what felt like a seizure shook me. I recall lying on the floor in my apartment in Cambridge. I was immersed in a book, The Seven Storey Mountain, walking my way through the tale\u0027s church. A monk moaned. And suddenly this, a thought careening across my cortex, I can\u0027t concentrate.",
        "Of course, the thought disturbed my concentration, and the monk\u0027s moan turned into a whisper, disappeared. I blinked, looked up from the book. The floor suddenly frightened me. Between the planks, I could see lines of dark dirt and the sway of a spider crawling.",
        "Let me get back, I thought, into the world of the book. I lowered my eyes to the page, but instead of being able to see the print, there was the thought blocking out all else-- I can\u0027t concentrate.",
        "Now I started to panic. Each time I tried to get back to the book, the words crumbled, lost their shapes. I said to myself, I must not allow that thought about concentration to come into my mind anymore. But of course the more I tried to suppress it, the louder it jangled.",
        "I looked at my hand. I ached for its familiar skin. But as I held it out, the sentence, I can\u0027t concentrate on my hand, blocked out my hand. So all I saw was a blur of flesh. I tried to force my brain onto other topics, but with each mental dodge, I became aware that I was dodging. And each time I itched, I became aware that I was itching. And with each inhalation, I became aware that I was inhaling. And I thought, if I think too much about breathing, will I forget how to breathe?",
        "Say \"God I\u0027m sorry\" 14 times I ordered myself. This is crazy, I said to myself. 15 times, a voice from somewhere else commanded.",
        "In the days after my attack, obsessive thoughts returned. What before had been inconsequential behaviors, like counting to three before I went through a doorway or checking the stove several times before bed, now became imperatives.",
        "There were a thousand and one of them to follow. Rules about how to step, what it meant to touch my mouth, a hot consuming urge to fix the crooked angles of the universe. It was constant, a cruel nattering. There, that tilted picture on the wall. Scratch your head with your left hand only.",
        "It was noise, the beak of a woodpecker in the soft bark of my brain. I did very little for the next year. I didn\u0027t want to go out, because any movement might set off a cycle of obsessions. I sat hunched and lost weight. Fear and grief prevented me from eating much.",
        "When I was too terrified to get out of bed, I checked into the local hospital, where I lay amidst IV drips, bags of blood, murmuring heart machines that let me know someone somewhere near was still alive.",
        "Then one day, my doctor said to me, there\u0027s a new medication called Prozac still in its trial period, but it\u0027s 70% effective with OCD. I want to send you to a Doctor Vuckovic. He\u0027s one of the physicians doing trial runs. I shrugged, willing to try. I\u0027d tried so much, surely this couldn\u0027t hurt. I didn\u0027t expect much, though. I certainly didn\u0027t expect what I finally got.",
        "The pads of paper on Vuckovic\u0027s desk are all edged in green and white with the word \"Prozac\" scripted across the bottom. The pen has \"Prozac\" embossed in tiny letters. He asks me about my symptoms for a few minutes, and then uses the Prozac pen to write out a prescription.",
        "After a couple of days of nausea and headaches, the Prozac began to work its magic. One morning, I woke up and waited for a command. Touch your nose. Blink 12 times. Try not to think about concentrating. The imperatives came. I could hear them, but from far away, like birds beyond a mountain, a sound nearly silent and easy to ignore.",
        "By the fourth day, I felt so shockingly fine that I called Doctor Vuckovic. I believed he had saved me. \"I\u0027m well,\" I told him. \"Not yet. It takes at least a month to build up the therapeutic blood level.\" \"No,\" I said. \"It doesn\u0027t.\" I felt rushing enjoy. \"The medicine you gave me has made me well. I\u0027ve actually never felt better.\" A pause on the line. \"I suppose it could be possible.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"It\u0027s happened.\"",
        "How could a drug change my mind so abruptly? My brain wasn\u0027t wet clay and paste, as all good brains should be, but a glinting thing crossed with wires. I wasn\u0027t human, but machine. No. I wasn\u0027t machine, but animal, linked to my electrified biology more completely than I could have imagined.",
        "We have come to think lately of machines and animals, of machines and nature, as occupying opposite sides of the spectrum. There is IBM, and then there\u0027s the lake. But really, they are so similar. A computer goes on when you push its button. A gazelle goes on when it sees a lynx. Only humans are supposedly different, above the pure cause and effect of the hard-wired primitive world. Free will and all.",
        "But no, maybe not. For I had swallowed a pill designed through technology. And in doing so, I was discovering myself embedded in an animal world. I was a purely chemical being, mood and personality seeping through serotonin. We are all taught to believe it\u0027s true. But how strange to feel that supposed truth bubbling right in your own tweaked brain pan.",
        "Mornings now, I got up early to jog, showered efficiently, then strode off to the library. I was able to go back to work, cutting deli part time at Formaggio\u0027s while I prepared myself for divinity school the next year by reading. I read with an appetite, hungry from all the time I\u0027d lost to illness. The pages of the book seemed very white. The words were easy, black beads shining, ebony in my quieted mind.",
        "Then one day, as though I\u0027d never swallowed a Prozac pill, my mind seized and clamped and the obsessions were back. I was staying with a family in Appalachia in Kentucky on an oral history project. During my interview with Kat, the mother, I decided to take a break in the sandy yard.",
        "It was almost 100 degrees. Chickens screamed and pecked. In one swift and seamless move, Pat\u0027s husband, Lonny, reached down to grab a bird. He laid it down on a stump, raised an ax, and cut. The body did its dance. Blood spilled. I ran inside. I took a step forward and then said to myself, don\u0027t take another step until you count to 25.",
        "After I\u0027d satisfied that imperative, I had to count to 25 again, and then halve 25, and then quarter it, before I felt safe enough to walk out the door. By the end of the day, each step took over 10 minutes to complete. I stopped taking steps. I sat on my bed.",
        "\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Kat said. \"Come out here and talk with us.\" I tried, but I got stuck in the doorway. There was a point above the doorway I just had to see, and then see again. And inside of me, something screamed, back again, back again.",
        "The next morning, a Sunday, Kat told me, \"You\u0027ll feel better if you come to church with us.\" She peered into my face, which must have been white and drawn. \"Are you suffering from some city sickness?\"",
        "\"Come to church,\" Kat said. \"We can ask the preacher to pray for you.\" But I didn\u0027t believe in prayer where my illness was concerned. I\u0027d come to think that whatever was wrong with me had a simplistic chemical cause.",
        "I woke late one night, fists clenched. It took me an hour to get out of bed, so many numbers I had to do. But I was determined. And then I was walking outside, pushing past the need to count before every step.",
        "I\u0027d passed midnight fields, a single shack with lighted windows. Cows slept in a pasture. I rounded the pasture, walked up a hill. And then before me, spreading out in moonlight, a lake. I stood by its lip. My mind was buzzing and jerking. I don\u0027t know at what point the swans appeared. White swans, they must\u0027ve been. But in silhouette, they looked black. And they seemed to materialize straight out of the water.",
        "They rose to the surface as memories rise to the surface of consciousness. Hundreds of black swans, suddenly floating absolutely silent. And as I stood there, the counting seized, my mind became silent, and I watched.",
        "The swans drifted until it seemed for a few moments that they were inside of me. Seven dark silent birds, 14 princesses, a single self swimming in a tepid sea. I don\u0027t know how long I stood there, or when exactly I left. The swans disappeared eventually. The counting, ticking, talking of my mind resumed.",
        "Still, even in shattering illness, I had been quieted for a bit. Doors in me had opened. Elegance had entered. This thought calmed me. I was not completely claimed by illness. Nor was I a prisoner of Prozac, entirely dependent on the medication to function. Part of me was still free, a private space not absolutely permeated by pain. A space I could learn to cultivate.",
        "It is a smaller space than I would have wished for myself. Even after I raised my dose, the Prozac never worked as well as it once had. And years later, I am sometimes sad about that. Other times, strangely relieved, even though my brain is hounded. I still must check my keys, the stove. I must pause many times while I write this and do a ritual count to 30.",
        "It\u0027s distracting to say the least. But still, I write this. I can walk, and talk, and play. I\u0027ve come to live my life in those brief stretches of silence that arrive throughout the day. I am learning something about the single moment. How rife with potential it is. How truly loud its tick.",
        "There is something satisfying and scary about making an angel, lowering your bulky body into the drowning fluff, stray flakes landing on your face. I am seven or eight, and the sky looms above me, gray and dead.",
        "I move my arms and legs, expanding, contracting, sculpting snow before it can swallow me up. I register a mistake on my angel, what looks like a thumb print on its left wing. I reach down to erase it, but am unable to smooth the snow perfectly. So I start again on another angel, lowering myself, swishing and sweeping, rolling over.",
        "No, yet another mistake. This time, the symmetry in the wing span is wrong. A compulsion comes over me. I do it again and again.",
        "In my memory, hours go by. My fingers inside my mittens get wrinkled and raw. My breath comes heavily and the snow begins to blue. A moon rises, a perfect crescent curl whose precise shape I will never be able to recreate. I ache for something I cannot name. Someone calls me. Come in now, come in now.",
        "Very early the next morning, I awaken, look out my bedroom window, and see the yard covered with my frantic forms. Hundreds of angels, none of them quite right. The forms twist and strain, the wings seeming to struggle up in the winter sun, as if each angel were longing for escape, for a free flight that might crack the crystal and ice of our still, stiff world."

        "You do?",
        "The big symmetry thing that I can remember is going to a Broadway show with my family. And I had this sense that it didn\u0027t feel quite right to just clap with my hands. And so, I developed this thing about clapping with my elbows, with this idea that somehow that would produce a more symmetrical experience. And so, I would clap with my hands, and then clap with my elbows, and then maybe even clap with the entire hand and elbow.",
        "And I can remember just sitting there and someone turning to me and saying, what are you doing? What are you doing with your elbows? And thinking like, this is not normal.",
        "Yeah. But I always felt like your irritation about it was just irrational. I mean, for example, it used to come up a lot with the alarm clock, right? Like, I set my alarm clock usually for 8:02. If I need a little more sleep, then it\u0027s 8:12 or 8:22. I don\u0027t really like 8:32, but I\u0027ll do that.",
        "But so, when I used to want to set the alarm clock for 8:02, and you would object and want to set it-- I mean, first of all, sometimes you would object. You would just want to set it for 8:03, which was just pure malice on your part. Like, obviously, I\u0027m not going to be happy if the alarm clock is set for 8:03. I mean, what would you really care if I set the alarm clock for 8:02?",
        "But you only think about it as piling stuff if it\u0027s something that really feels like an obligation. Which the two thing is in a certain way, but it\u0027s also just something that you like, or that I like.",
        "That\u0027s because I realized it was coming out of a sadistic impulse in you.",
        "No, you would never just happen to set it 8:01. You would set it and there\u0027d be something very sinister about your setting the alarm clock.",
        "Is this really the place to rehearse this?",
        "I mean, there is a way in which I\u0027m addicted to the two thing. And in a way, that\u0027s almost as powerful as any other physical addiction.",
        "So I started being very preoccupied with doing things twice. If I, for example, dropped keys, I would then lean down and pick them up. But before I actually picked them up, I would probably drop them again. Like really close to the floor so no one would quite know what I was doing. But I\u0027d be very aware that I was fulfilling some sort of two obligation.",
        "No. I think that I actually kind of like it. I mean, I think I like having that kind of order in my life and having routine.",
        "Well, I mean, I was clued in enough to know that people would think it would be kind of weird. Your average Joe is not going to be that sympathetic to someone who has an obsession with the number two.",
        "Although I do think-- the more I talk to people-- I do think people have variations of these things. You talked about it about being a continuum. And on the one side of the continuum, would be the people who you might just label as quirky. And the other side of the continuum would be the people who might have to start taking Prozac, right? And I think-- yeah, I think most people are on the continuum.",
        "Yes.",
        "But my siblings and stuff, I don\u0027t think they really experienced-- I could imagine that it is a kind of substitute. But if is, then it was pretty specific to me.",
        "What do you know about [? Elena ?] and the rubber bands?",
        "And do you know why she wore them?",
        "I don\u0027t know either. I think she wore them-- I mean, she wore a lot of rubber bands. She didn\u0027t just wear them around her arm. She wore big rubber bands around her neck too. [LAUGHS] She had lots of rubber bands all the time. And I think she also carried paperclips in her pockets.",
        "I think if you go into any house though, you\u0027ll find these kind of things. My mother used to say that having four kids expanded her idea of the normal. Like, what the normal could entail.",
        "My favorite color was blue, and I also had this fantasy that blue was basically an even color. So it all seemed to fit in. But yellow seemed much more odd to me. And red seemed odd to me. And brown seemed even. Black seemed odd. This doesn\u0027t resonate at all with you?",
        "Yeah, days. Both Sunday and Monday seem even to me. But I don\u0027t like them as days at all. I much prefer Tuesdays and Thursdays, which seem odd. I mean, days are weird. Monday, Wednesday seems pretty even to me. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday all seem odd."

        "I haven\u0027t had much luck describing this work. What does that mean, a beaded kitchen? You imagine a beaded skirt or a beaded top. The best I can do is I can say, this is a three-dimensional room. It\u0027s 200 square feet. It\u0027s painted. But it\u0027s painted with beads that you have to apply with the tweezers one at a time.",
        "So it\u0027s this amazing amount of color. It\u0027s pinks and blues and silvers and golds. Imagine a wood grain counter in your kitchen. Only suddenly, instead of brown wood, it\u0027s become golden and yellow and burnt copper.",
        "I didn\u0027t think about it. I thought it would take about six months to do when I started. I didn\u0027t think it would take so much. I didn\u0027t realize it would take my life. It\u0027s like falling in love, maybe. It\u0027s a form of where you watch you life-- you watch everything else fall away. You lose everything in a sense.",
        "For five years, I was in the constant stage of to-do lists. Of stress and pressure, and always feeling like a failure. Because every day you feel as though you\u0027ve got nothing done. You maybe get five inches of work done-- five inches of an entirely beaded kitchen.",
        "It\u0027s such a personal problem. I mean, yeah. I always would feel like I didn\u0027t get enough done. I never had the feeling of, wow, did I just really do well today. Maybe I\u0027ll work an 18-hour day. And then maybe I\u0027ll continue to do that for two weeks. So how much time did that take? I don\u0027t clock in.",
        "I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know. And I don\u0027t know how much it cost me to do it. I don\u0027t know. If I knew those answers, I wouldn\u0027t do it. Nobody who thinks like that would bead a kitchen.",
        "The wall panels were really challenging. Because the curiosity is the thing that motivates me. I\u0027m not patient, I\u0027m curious. So I already knew-- once I had done one wall panel, I knew what it was going to look like. Then I had to do nine more or eight more panels. And then they all get put together. And that was really difficult.",
        "I would wonder, god, why am I so depressed? And then, finally, I stood the whole wall up and I realized, my god, no wonder I\u0027ve been depressed. I\u0027ve been doing the same pattern for the last three months.",
        "It\u0027s one step backward, and then another step forward, hopefully. Hopefully, it would buy two months in the studio-- one sale or two sales. And the problem with my work is that it takes so long. So selling a soup can wouldn\u0027t just set me back a day. It would set me back maybe several weeks.",
        "For a long time, I resented how hard it was. This didn\u0027t seem right. I mean, nobody who works at I. Magnin has to work at I. Magnin in order to then work at I. Magnin. Do you know what I mean?",
        "Oh, thank god I didn\u0027t have to answer that question.",
        "The thing is, people think I\u0027m patient. And I\u0027m not patient. I\u0027m tremendously impatient. But I\u0027m very, very curious. Just to point of death, I\u0027m curious. I wanted to know what it would look like to bead a table. That\u0027s what got me through it. It\u0027s the same pattern. It\u0027s a pink and silver and blue pattern, again and again and again and again. But what sustained the interest was, what will it look like when it\u0027s finished?",
        "So if I had lost the piece, and I knew what it took to do the piece, and I already knew what it looked like, why would I do it again? What would be the motivating factor? Would that be to make it so that you could see it? I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s what motivates me. I\u0027m not sure if the approval of anyone else is what motivates me.",
        "If I had known that there would be those kind of sacrifices, I probably wouldn\u0027t have done it. But as they came up, it was sort of like, as you cross that road, you decide if you\u0027re going to jump over it or if you\u0027re going to retreat. And every time, I found that I would jump over it.",
        "Life is so-- there\u0027s so much chaos. I think that one of the great solutions to dealing with that chaos is to have a mission, to have some kind of purpose. That\u0027s sort of the way I deal with why I\u0027m here, is to make every square inch something meaningful. My materials happen to speak of that, because they are so slow and painstaking. And I have all this time to think about purpose, and why am I doing this, and is this a meaningful thing to be doing? Everything has meaning. That\u0027s the philosophy of my work. Absolutely everything has meaning if you give it meaning.",
        "I had this thing up in my studio. And also it\u0027s a loft. So I was having something repaired. And the repairman came inside and was fixing my washer and dryer. And he looked at my kitchen, and it was almost finished. So it was really what you\u0027re looking at, just about, maybe minus a tile or too. He put his hands on his hips. He said, neat hobby.

            "The big symmetry thing that I can remember is going to a Broadway show with my family. And I had this sense that it didn\u0027t feel quite right to just clap with my hands. And so, I developed this thing about clapping with my elbows, with this idea that somehow that would produce a more symmetrical experience. And so, I would clap with my hands, and then clap with my elbows, and then maybe even clap with the entire hand and elbow.",
            "And I can remember just sitting there and someone turning to me and saying, what are you doing? What are you doing with your elbows? And thinking like, this is not normal.",
            "Yeah. But I always felt like your irritation about it was just irrational. I mean, for example, it used to come up a lot with the alarm clock, right? Like, I set my alarm clock usually for 8:02. If I need a little more sleep, then it\u0027s 8:12 or 8:22. I don\u0027t really like 8:32, but I\u0027ll do that.",
            "But so, when I used to want to set the alarm clock for 8:02, and you would object and want to set it-- I mean, first of all, sometimes you would object. You would just want to set it for 8:03, which was just pure malice on your part. Like, obviously, I\u0027m not going to be happy if the alarm clock is set for 8:03. I mean, what would you really care if I set the alarm clock for 8:02?",
            "But you only think about it as piling stuff if it\u0027s something that really feels like an obligation. Which the two thing is in a certain way, but it\u0027s also just something that you like, or that I like.",
            "That\u0027s because I realized it was coming out of a sadistic impulse in you.",
            "No, you would never just happen to set it 8:01. You would set it and there\u0027d be something very sinister about your setting the alarm clock.",
            "Is this really the place to rehearse this?",
            "I mean, there is a way in which I\u0027m addicted to the two thing. And in a way, that\u0027s almost as powerful as any other physical addiction.",
            "So I started being very preoccupied with doing things twice. If I, for example, dropped keys, I would then lean down and pick them up. But before I actually picked them up, I would probably drop them again. Like really close to the floor so no one would quite know what I was doing. But I\u0027d be very aware that I was fulfilling some sort of two obligation.",
            "No. I think that I actually kind of like it. I mean, I think I like having that kind of order in my life and having routine.",
            "Well, I mean, I was clued in enough to know that people would think it would be kind of weird. Your average Joe is not going to be that sympathetic to someone who has an obsession with the number two.",
            "Although I do think-- the more I talk to people-- I do think people have variations of these things. You talked about it about being a continuum. And on the one side of the continuum, would be the people who you might just label as quirky. And the other side of the continuum would be the people who might have to start taking Prozac, right?

[LAUGHS] She had lots of rubber bands all the time. And I think she also carried paperclips in her pockets.",

            "Yeah, days. Both Sunday and Monday seem even to me. But I don\u0027t like them as days at all. I much prefer Tuesdays and Thursdays, which seem odd. I mean, days are weird. Monday, Wednesday seems pretty even to me. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday all seem odd."

            "One of the first people that I talked to is actually someone that I know really well, an ex-girlfriend of mine named Jillian. And what I wanted to talk to her about was her obsession with the number two.",
            "I\u0027ve got to say, I see it totally differently.",
            "Yeah. I see Tuesdays and Thursdays and Saturdays as even, and all the others as odd. I mean Tuesday, first of all-- it kind of goes without saying.",
            "What I want to ask you about is the relationship between the two thing and other people in your life. And I just sort of remember that there were times when you and I were going out where I would get really mad about the two thing. I mean, do you remember those times when I would get mad about twos?",
            "When she was a kid, just like any kid, she had a favorite number, a favorite color. And her favorite number was two. But it became a lot bigger than that.",
            "Well, I actually remember that the minute we started talking about it. I actually remember what made me mad about not being able to set the clock for 8:01. Because it is about unnecessarily cluttering your life with things. Spending extra time piling stuff onto your good mood or bad mood just seems totally unnecessary.",
            "But that\u0027s not what would bother me about it. It wasn\u0027t just that you would say, oh, 8:02. Oh, you set it for 8:02. That\u0027s great. That\u0027s going to be fun. It was like, if it was 8:01, you\u0027d go nuts. It wasn\u0027t just--",
            "Well, if I just happened to be fast-forwarding through the 24 hours, and then I\u0027d drop it around--",
            "It only became sinister after I had already felt like you were overdoing it.",
            "And that doesn\u0027t bother you?",
            "When you would drop the keys and pick them up again, you\u0027d do that sort of quietly, right? So that other people wouldn\u0027t think you were doing that?",
            "We talked about it a lot. And I don\u0027t think either one of us really came up with a definite answer. The one thing I kept thinking about though is, to me, obsessions can sometimes take the place of religion in people\u0027s lives. An organized religion gives you certain rules, certain rituals, by which to live your life. Things will be orderly if you follow those rules. And if you grow up in a nonreligious environment, maybe you start creating those rules for yourself.",
            "You grew up in a pretty atheist household, right?",
            "So do you think that maybe people who grew up in that sort of household, where there weren\u0027t a lot of sets of rituals and where it was sort of a hyper-rational household-- you know what I mean? There\u0027s no religion. There\u0027s two psychologists as parents, who both basically believe that everything can be figured out.",
            "But both you-- and I think your siblings too-- have this tendency towards magical thinking.",
            "Her obligations weren\u0027t all-consuming, but they were somewhat laborious. At the dinner table or in class, she\u0027d say something, and then she\u0027d have to repeat it under her breath to make it two.",
            "What about [? Elena ?] and the rubber bands?",
            "I know that she wore rubber bands around her arm every day for a couple of years or something.",
            "No.",
            "And that\u0027s a hyper-rational thing, your family--",
            "If she made a phone call and the person that she was calling wasn\u0027t there, she\u0027d have to let the phone ring an even number of times. She started to see the whole world as being divided into things that were even, things that were on the side of two, and things that were odd.",
            "Well, I\u0027ve gathered another few stories about obsession. The next one is a little bit further down that continuum. This is one with somewhat more serious consequences.",
            "Well, I can see blue being even.",
            "Tell me a little bit more about the other associations with two. Like you talked about-- I think you told me once that days of the week were as well?"

The one thing I kept thinking about though is, to me, obsessions can sometimes take the place of religion in people\u0027s lives. An organized religion gives you certain rules, certain rituals, by which to live your life. Things will be orderly if you follow those rules.

            "Looking back on it now, I think maybe those moments in the snow were when my OCD began, although it didn\u0027t come to me full-fledged until my mid-20s. OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder, and some studies say over three million Americans suffer from it.",
            "Some mental health professionals claim that the onset of obsession is a response to an underlying fear-- a recent trauma, say, or a loss. I don\u0027t believe that that is always true. Because no matter how hard I think about it, I remember nothing unusual or disorienting before my first attack.",
            "I don\u0027t know exactly why at 2 o\u0027clock one Saturday afternoon what felt like a seizure shook me. I recall lying on the floor in my apartment in Cambridge. I was immersed in a book, The Seven Storey Mountain, walking my way through the tale\u0027s church. A monk moaned. And suddenly this, a thought careening across my cortex, I can\u0027t concentrate.",
            "Of course, the thought disturbed my concentration, and the monk\u0027s moan turned into a whisper, disappeared. I blinked, looked up from the book. The floor suddenly frightened me. Between the planks, I could see lines of dark dirt and the sway of a spider crawling.",
            "Let me get back, I thought, into the world of the book. I lowered my eyes to the page, but instead of being able to see the print, there was the thought blocking out all else-- I can\u0027t concentrate.",
            "Now I started to panic. Each time I tried to get back to the book, the words crumbled, lost their shapes. I said to myself, I must not allow that thought about concentration to come into my mind anymore. But of course the more I tried to suppress it, the louder it jangled.",
            "I looked at my hand. I ached for its familiar skin. But as I held it out, the sentence, I can\u0027t concentrate on my hand, blocked out my hand. So all I saw was a blur of flesh. I tried to force my brain onto other topics, but with each mental dodge, I became aware that I was dodging. And each time I itched, I became aware that I was itching. And with each inhalation, I became aware that I was inhaling. And I thought, if I think too much about breathing, will I forget how to breathe?",
            "Say \"God I\u0027m sorry\" 14 times I ordered myself. This is crazy, I said to myself. 15 times, a voice from somewhere else commanded.",
            "In the days after my attack, obsessive thoughts returned. What before had been inconsequential behaviors, like counting to three before I went through a doorway or checking the stove several times before bed, now became imperatives.",
            "There were a thousand and one of them to follow. Rules about how to step, what it meant to touch my mouth, a hot consuming urge to fix the crooked angles of the universe. It was constant, a cruel nattering. There, that tilted picture on the wall. Scratch your head with your left hand only.",
            "It was noise, the beak of a woodpecker in the soft bark of my brain. I did very little for the next year. I didn\u0027t want to go out, because any movement might set off a cycle of obsessions. I sat hunched and lost weight. Fear and grief prevented me from eating much.",
            "When I was too terrified to get out of bed, I checked into the local hospital, where I lay amidst IV drips, bags of blood, murmuring heart machines that let me know someone somewhere near was still alive.",
            "Then one day, my doctor said to me, there\u0027s a new medication called Prozac still in its trial period, but it\u0027s 70% effective with OCD. I want to send you to a Doctor Vuckovic. He\u0027s one of the physicians doing trial runs. I shrugged, willing to try. I\u0027d tried so much, surely this couldn\u0027t hurt. I didn\u0027t expect much, though. I certainly didn\u0027t expect what I finally got.",
            "The pads of paper on Vuckovic\u0027s desk are all edged in green and white with the word \"Prozac\" scripted across the bottom. The pen has \"Prozac\" embossed in tiny letters. He asks me about my symptoms for a few minutes, and then uses the Prozac pen to write out a prescription.",
            "After a couple of days of nausea and headaches, the Prozac began to work its magic. One morning, I woke up and waited for a command. Touch your nose. Blink 12 times. Try not to think about concentrating. The imperatives came. I could hear them, but from far away, like birds beyond a mountain, a sound nearly silent and easy to ignore.",
            "By the fourth day, I felt so shockingly fine that I called Doctor Vuckovic. I believed he had saved me. \"I\u0027m well,\" I told him. \"Not yet. It takes at least a month to build up the therapeutic blood level.\" \"No,\" I said. \"It doesn\u0027t.\" I felt rushing enjoy. \"The medicine you gave me has made me well. I\u0027ve actually never felt better.\" A pause on the line. \"I suppose it could be possible.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"It\u0027s happened.\"",
            "How could a drug change my mind so abruptly? My brain wasn\u0027t wet clay and paste, as all good brains should be, but a glinting thing crossed with wires. I wasn\u0027t human, but machine. No. I wasn\u0027t machine, but animal, linked to my electrified biology more completely than I could have imagined.",
            "We have come to think lately of machines and animals, of machines and nature, as occupying opposite sides of the spectrum. There is IBM, and then there\u0027s the lake. But really, they are so similar. A computer goes on when you push its button. A gazelle goes on when it sees a lynx. Only humans are supposedly different, above the pure cause and effect of the hard-wired primitive world. Free will and all.",
            "But no, maybe not. For I had swallowed a pill designed through technology. And in doing so, I was discovering myself embedded in an animal world. I was a purely chemical being, mood and personality seeping through serotonin. We are all taught to believe it\u0027s true. But how strange to feel that supposed truth bubbling right in your own tweaked brain pan.",
            "Mornings now, I got up early to jog, showered efficiently, then strode off to the library. I was able to go back to work, cutting deli part time at Formaggio\u0027s while I prepared myself for divinity school the next year by reading. I read with an appetite, hungry from all the time I\u0027d lost to illness. The pages of the book seemed very white. The words were easy, black beads shining, ebony in my quieted mind.",
            "Then one day, as though I\u0027d never swallowed a Prozac pill, my mind seized and clamped and the obsessions were back. I was staying with a family in Appalachia in Kentucky on an oral history project. During my interview with Kat, the mother, I decided to take a break in the sandy yard.",
            "It was almost 100 degrees. Chickens screamed and pecked. In one swift and seamless move, Pat\u0027s husband, Lonny, reached down to grab a bird. He laid it down on a stump, raised an ax, and cut. The body did its dance. Blood spilled. I ran inside. I took a step forward and then said to myself, don\u0027t take another step until you count to 25.",
            "After I\u0027d satisfied that imperative, I had to count to 25 again, and then halve 25, and then quarter it, before I felt safe enough to walk out the door. By the end of the day, each step took over 10 minutes to complete. I stopped taking steps. I sat on my bed.",
            "\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Kat said. \"Come out here and talk with us.\" I tried, but I got stuck in the doorway. There was a point above the doorway I just had to see, and then see again. And inside of me, something screamed, back again, back again.",
            "The next morning, a Sunday, Kat told me, \"You\u0027ll feel better if you come to church with us.\" She peered into my face, which must have been white and drawn. \"Are you suffering from some city sickness?\"",
            "\"Come to church,\" Kat said. \"We can ask the preacher to pray for you.\" But I didn\u0027t believe in prayer where my illness was concerned. I\u0027d come to think that whatever was wrong with me had a simplistic chemical cause.",
            "I woke late one night, fists clenched. It took me an hour to get out of bed, so many numbers I had to do. But I was determined. And then I was walking outside, pushing past the need to count before every step.",
            "I\u0027d passed midnight fields, a single shack with lighted windows. Cows slept in a pasture. I rounded the pasture, walked up a hill. And then before me, spreading out in moonlight, a lake. I stood by its lip. My mind was buzzing and jerking. I don\u0027t know at what point the swans appeared. White swans, they must\u0027ve been. But in silhouette, they looked black. And they seemed to materialize straight out of the water.",
            "They rose to the surface as memories rise to the surface of consciousness. Hundreds of black swans, suddenly floating absolutely silent. And as I stood there, the counting seized, my mind became silent, and I watched.",
            "The swans drifted until it seemed for a few moments that they were inside of me. Seven dark silent birds, 14 princesses, a single self swimming in a tepid sea. I don\u0027t know how long I stood there, or when exactly I left. The swans disappeared eventually. The counting, ticking, talking of my mind resumed.",
            "Still, even in shattering illness, I had been quieted for a bit. Doors in me had opened. Elegance had entered. This thought calmed me. I was not completely claimed by illness. Nor was I a prisoner of Prozac, entirely dependent on the medication to function. Part of me was still free, a private space not absolutely permeated by pain. A space I could learn to cultivate.",
            "It is a smaller space than I would have wished for myself. Even after I raised my dose, the Prozac never worked as well as it once had. And years later, I am sometimes sad about that. Other times, strangely relieved, even though my brain is hounded. I still must check my keys, the stove. I must pause many times while I write this and do a ritual count to 30.",
            "It\u0027s distracting to say the least. But still, I write this. I can walk, and talk, and play. I\u0027ve come to live my life in those brief stretches of silence that arrive throughout the day. I am learning something about the single moment. How rife with potential it is. How truly loud its tick.",
            "There is something satisfying and scary about making an angel, lowering your bulky body into the drowning fluff, stray flakes landing on your face. I am seven or eight, and the sky looms above me, gray and dead.",
            "I move my arms and legs, expanding, contracting, sculpting snow before it can swallow me up. I register a mistake on my angel, what looks like a thumb print on its left wing. I reach down to erase it, but am unable to smooth the snow perfectly. So I start again on another angel, lowering myself, swishing and sweeping, rolling over.",
            "No, yet another mistake. This time, the symmetry in the wing span is wrong. A compulsion comes over me. I do it again and again.",
            "In my memory, hours go by. My fingers inside my mittens get wrinkled and raw. My breath comes heavily and the snow begins to blue. A moon rises, a perfect crescent curl whose precise shape I will never be able to recreate. I ache for something I cannot name. Someone calls me. Come in now, come in now.",
            "Very early the next morning, I awaken, look out my bedroom window, and see the yard covered with my frantic forms. Hundreds of angels, none of them quite right. The forms twist and strain, the wings seeming to struggle up in the winter sun, as if each angel were longing for escape, for a free flight that might crack the crystal and ice of our still, stiff world."

Ira, the thing that\u0027s I think a little scary about these compulsions, even the ones that are pretty innocent like Jillian\u0027s, is that you feel when you\u0027ve got them that something else is controlling you. And so, that makes you think that you could just suddenly go over the edge, just because you\u0027re out of control. There\u0027s a sense that something else is writing the rules.",

            "And one thing that\u0027s really interesting to me about Lauren, especially after having talked to Jillian, is that they sort of started in the same place. As a child, Lauren did a lot of the same compulsive things that Jillian did, had a lot of the same superstitious beliefs and fears. When she walked through a door, she had to tap the frame three times. When she said her prayers at night, between each prayer, she thought she had to close her eyes and then count to 10 and 1/2. But at some point, it went further than that.",

That in that kind of Judaism, nearly every act of human life is accompanied by some kind of ritual, or a thanks to God, or a prayer, including putting on clothes, washing your hands, using the bathroom, strict rules about what you can eat and how you eat it. You know, the Kosher laws. Rules on covering the head. A religious Jew kisses the mezuzah on the door frames in his own home when he enters and leaves a room. Plus all sorts of prayers and blessings.",
            "This is Mayer Silber, 35 years old, father of three, a member of the Chabad Hasidic Community here in Chicago. He\u0027s a litigator for the local district council of the IRS. He was gracious enough to come in and talk to me about the similarities and differences between the hundred rituals that he does as a religious Jew every day, and the more secular rituals that you\u0027ve been talking about, the people you\u0027ve interviewed, Paul, have been talking about over the course of the hour so far.",

Jillian\u0027s having to do things in twos-- dropping her car keys and then having to drop them a second time. Or Lauren Slater\u0027s having to count to 30 every now and then before she can allow herself to move forward in any task. And Mayer Silber said, really, he only sees one similarity between what they\u0027re doing and what he does.",
            "One interesting difference between Mayer and the people who we\u0027ve heard about so far in the program is that when Mayer goes through his daily rituals-- when any religious person, I guess, goes through their daily rituals-- it connects him to a tradition, to the Bible, to the Torah, to his family, to his people. Whereas the people who we\u0027ve heard in the show up \u0027til now, when they go through the day with their very obsessive rituals, it doesn\u0027t connect them to anyone else.

            "So you have kind of a meta-obsession going. Sort of an obsession with obsessions.",
            "At least for the purposes of this hour. And as you\u0027ve been putting this show together over the last few weeks, you\u0027ve been saying that these kinds of compulsions that we\u0027re hearing about share a lot with religion.",
            "This reminded me-- when we\u0027ve talked about this-- this reminded me of something that I learned in Hebrew school as a kid. Let me get some music going there. [MUSIC PLAYING] There we go. This music was always playing when I was a child, Paul. in the schtiebl in Baltimore."

You know, the Kosher laws. Rules on covering the head. A religious Jew kisses the mezuzah on the door frames in his own home when he enters and leaves a room.

Whereas the people who we\u0027ve heard in the show up \u0027til now, when they go through the day with their very obsessive rituals, it doesn\u0027t connect them to anyone else.

            "So this is a true story that happened long ago when I was a teenager. And I was on this train. Like, I\u0027d run away I think with this guy. And we were on this train. And we\u0027d been going for days and nights. And it had got really steamy on this train. And it\u0027s kind of a seedy atmosphere. And everybody was playing cards. All the time, playing cards and smoking.",
            "And then suddenly, this fight broke out. Like, out of nowhere. First, it was just these sounds. It was, like, really muffled sounds. Bodies colliding and ricocheting down the corridors and stuff. And then these kind of muffled shots.",
            "And we pulled the door across our compartment, and this body kind of rolled over, rolled past, stumbled past. And there was blood just smeared all over the glass. And you couldn\u0027t see anything because of that. It\u0027s like the sounds and the vision, and everything was muffled.",
            "But it took hours and hours before we reached the next town, and we\u0027re going through this small desert. But when we eventually got there, the train stopped. And there was this scene kind of took place in absolute silence. It was extraordinary. No one seemed to speak. And it was incredibly hot and hazy. And there was just this desert all around.",
            "And they took the body off the train. And then the guy who\u0027d killed him was taken off with handcuffs. And these few cops appeared from nowhere. And it was just like this platform in the middle of nowhere. I mean suddenly, out of the silence, this scream came. It was just like something between a wail and a scream. And it\u0027s like it just went right through the whole landscape.",
            "And it\u0027s like the dust sort of settled in the air as the scream kind of just hung there. It just seemed like for ages. I don\u0027t know if I can do that scream. I can hear it really, really clearly. I\u0027ll try, but I think it won\u0027t be like that. Anyway, it was something like this. [SCREAMING]"

A guy named Greg Whitehead has been collecting the sound of people screaming-- and their thoughts about the meaning of different kinds of screams-- for years all over the world.

            "Now Ira, one thing about the way that we judge obsessions is how successful the person is. I mean, take Michael Jordan. In every way, he\u0027s a completely obsessed person. He\u0027s obsessed with winning, to what we\u0027d consider to be a really unhealthy degree if he wasn\u0027t such a good basketball player. I mean, it\u0027s just lucky that he is able to carry the team on his back whenever he needs to and actually win. If not, he\u0027d be up on a freeway overpass somewhere.",
            "Well, the next person that I talked to is an artist in San Diego named Liza Lou. And she is another obsessed person who has a heroic narrative of obsession. For five years, she had a ritual that she did every day. She would get up in the morning, get dressed, get ready to go about her day, and then sit down at her studio with tweezers, and white glue, and tens of thousands of tiny little beads. And she would spend the whole day gluing them down into patterns. And at the end of five years, she\u0027d created this amazing work of art.",
            "There\u0027s a table in the middle of the kitchen with a bright beaded tablecloth. On the table are a plate of pancakes that\u0027s beaded, and a cereal box that\u0027s beaded, and toast and bacon and a newspaper-- all of them beaded.",
            "Behind the table, there are beaded cupboards, a beaded fridge, cookbook, stove. Every surface is covered with tens of thousands of beads. And the effect is one of unbelievable color. The whole place seems like it\u0027s plugged in. It\u0027s just shining. Nothing\u0027s bare. There\u0027s even a beaded dustpan on the floor that\u0027s filled with beaded dust.",
            "The thing about an obsession is you never know where it\u0027s going to lead. One minute, you\u0027re just a regular person collecting autographs or saving string or trying to keep clean. And then, something just overtakes you. For Liza-- and I think for a lot of people-- you reach a point where it\u0027s suddenly not so much fun. It\u0027s a job. It\u0027s a duty.",
            "So you really felt like a failure every day for five years?",
            "How many days in those five years did you not work on it at all?",
            "She didn\u0027t have any grants or patrons when she was working on the kitchen. So to make ends meet, she\u0027d have to sell pieces of her work from time to time. And, of course, the pieces that she\u0027d sell would be beaded. They would be pieces from the kitchen. And in fact, she says that she\u0027s probably sold the equivalent of the kitchen. There\u0027s sort of another entire kitchen out there in various people\u0027s homes. So she\u0027d have to bead in order to buy beads in order to bead.",
            "Right.",
            "She was living in LA a couple of years ago, and there was an earthquake that almost destroyed the building that her studio was in. I got this phone call in the middle of the night. I had an apartment where basically they were locking the studio out, where you would lose everything.",
            "They did this to doctors\u0027 offices. They lost all their files. Because once a building is condemned, they lock it out, and you can\u0027t get back in. So there was this moment where I didn\u0027t know if I was going to lose three years of work.",
            "And if I had lost it, if it had gotten locked out, I wondered, would I do it again? Would I make that table again? But thankfully, I had time. We had two hours to get everything. And a bunch of friends came and we just shoved everything. And this work is so fragile. Can you imagine doing this in two hours? But we got everything in the truck. And I ended up moving even further south to San Diego.",
            "So did you ever answer that question for yourself, about what you would have done if it was destroyed?",
            "Liza Lou\u0027s kitchen is currently on display in a museum in Minneapolis. And she\u0027s working on a beaded backyard, including a million beaded blades of grass."

            "I haven\u0027t had much luck describing this work. What does that mean, a beaded kitchen? You imagine a beaded skirt or a beaded top. The best I can do is I can say, this is a three-dimensional room. It\u0027s 200 square feet. It\u0027s painted. But it\u0027s painted with beads that you have to apply with the tweezers one at a time.",
            "So it\u0027s this amazing amount of color. It\u0027s pinks and blues and silvers and golds. Imagine a wood grain counter in your kitchen. Only suddenly, instead of brown wood, it\u0027s become golden and yellow and burnt copper.",
            "I didn\u0027t think about it. I thought it would take about six months to do when I started. I didn\u0027t think it would take so much. I didn\u0027t realize it would take my life. It\u0027s like falling in love, maybe. It\u0027s a form of where you watch you life-- you watch everything else fall away. You lose everything in a sense.",
            "For five years, I was in the constant stage of to-do lists. Of stress and pressure, and always feeling like a failure. Because every day you feel as though you\u0027ve got nothing done. You maybe get five inches of work done-- five inches of an entirely beaded kitchen.",
            "It\u0027s such a personal problem. I mean, yeah. I always would feel like I didn\u0027t get enough done. I never had the feeling of, wow, did I just really do well today. Maybe I\u0027ll work an 18-hour day. And then maybe I\u0027ll continue to do that for two weeks. So how much time did that take? I don\u0027t clock in.",
            "I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know. And I don\u0027t know how much it cost me to do it. I don\u0027t know. If I knew those answers, I wouldn\u0027t do it. Nobody who thinks like that would bead a kitchen.",
            "The wall panels were really challenging. Because the curiosity is the thing that motivates me. I\u0027m not patient, I\u0027m curious. So I already knew-- once I had done one wall panel, I knew what it was going to look like. Then I had to do nine more or eight more panels. And then they all get put together. And that was really difficult.",
            "I would wonder, god, why am I so depressed? And then, finally, I stood the whole wall up and I realized, my god, no wonder I\u0027ve been depressed. I\u0027ve been doing the same pattern for the last three months.",
            "It\u0027s one step backward, and then another step forward, hopefully. Hopefully, it would buy two months in the studio-- one sale or two sales. And the problem with my work is that it takes so long. So selling a soup can wouldn\u0027t just set me back a day. It would set me back maybe several weeks.",
            "For a long time, I resented how hard it was. This didn\u0027t seem right. I mean, nobody who works at I. Magnin has to work at I. Magnin in order to then work at I. Magnin. Do you know what I mean?",
            "Oh, thank god I didn\u0027t have to answer that question.",
            "The thing is, people think I\u0027m patient. And I\u0027m not patient. I\u0027m tremendously impatient. But I\u0027m very, very curious. Just to point of death, I\u0027m curious. I wanted to know what it would look like to bead a table. That\u0027s what got me through it. It\u0027s the same pattern. It\u0027s a pink and silver and blue pattern, again and again and again and again. But what sustained the interest was, what will it look like when it\u0027s finished?",
            "So if I had lost the piece, and I knew what it took to do the piece, and I already knew what it looked like, why would I do it again? What would be the motivating factor? Would that be to make it so that you could see it? I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s what motivates me. I\u0027m not sure if the approval of anyone else is what motivates me.",
            "If I had known that there would be those kind of sacrifices, I probably wouldn\u0027t have done it. But as they came up, it was sort of like, as you cross that road, you decide if you\u0027re going to jump over it or if you\u0027re going to retreat. And every time, I found that I would jump over it.",
            "Life is so-- there\u0027s so much chaos. I think that one of the great solutions to dealing with that chaos is to have a mission, to have some kind of purpose. That\u0027s sort of the way I deal with why I\u0027m here, is to make every square inch something meaningful. My materials happen to speak of that, because they are so slow and painstaking. And I have all this time to think about purpose, and why am I doing this, and is this a meaningful thing to be doing? Everything has meaning. That\u0027s the philosophy of my work. Absolutely everything has meaning if you give it meaning.",
            "I had this thing up in my studio. And also it\u0027s a loft. So I was having something repaired. And the repairman came inside and was fixing my washer and dryer. And he looked at my kitchen, and it was almost finished. So it was really what you\u0027re looking at, just about, maybe minus a tile or too. He put his hands on his hips. He said, neat hobby.
