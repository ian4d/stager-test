I mean, she\u0027d talk to a girl on the White team and everything. And all I could think was, if you have to say something like that, you know there\u0027s going to be trouble. The speculation about who will get the honor of being captain of the Color Days team, the biggest honor at camp, is so intense that, weeks before Color Days begins, Lindsay Sayowitz and some friends in Bryn Mawr East decide to consult Lindsay\u0027s Ouija board.","Everyone thinks Alissa\u0027s a shoe-in. And the Ouija board also picked Jamie Stream, another favorite, and Lindsay Sayowitz, who, coincidentally, had her hands on the Ouija pointer at the time.","Two weeks later, in the middle of the night, all the girls\u0027 counselors snake through the cabin area with lit kerosene torches and wake up the girls for the opening ceremonies of Color Days 1998.","Little girls stumble out onto the sidewalks, rubbing their eyes, wearing mismatched shoes and looking confused. Across the way, the Bryn Mawr girls have never even gone to sleep, anticipating this moment when they find out which one of them will be named Color Days captain. They stand with their faces pressed up to the screen door of their cabin, holding hands and silently crying. Counselors with torches lead 120 girls. They march down to the lakefront and surround an enormous bonfire 10 feet high. It looks like some cross between a debutante ball and a Klan rally.","Like a summer stock Grecian play, one of the counselors dressed in a white toga comes out of the forest and stands behind the fire.","The spirit for the Blue team, another counselor in a toga, appears before the fire and talks about blue and blueness. Candles are lit, and the girls vow to abide by the camp\u0027s seven virtues during Color Days. Those virtues? Friendship, determination, sportsmanship, tolerance, enthusiasm, patience, and unity.","Finally, the camp director, Dayna, picks up four whistles, two on a white string and two on blue. This is the moment everyone\u0027s been waiting for and guessing about, the moment Dayna remembers so well from 16 years ago when she was at Bryn Mawr. She walks behind all the girls to the last row, where the Bryn Mawr sit, and silently places the necklaces over the heads of the girls selected to be the captains of Color Days 1998.","[SOBBING]","","The chosen girls stand up, sob, and cling to each other. The other girls stay seated, sob, and cling to each other. It turns out the Ouija board was only right about one of the captains, Lindsay Segenreich. Alissa and Jamie looked shocked and heartbroken. There\u0027s so much crying, some of the girls can barely walk straight as they stumble back to their cabins after the ceremony. Because of the vow of silence, there are lots of sniffles, gasps, and blowing noses. Color Days hasn\u0027t even started yet.","It\u0027s the next morning, and the White team has gathered for their first team meeting. The veteran campers are dressed entirely in white-- white shoes, shirts, socks, bandannas. Their faces are painted white. Their hair is painted white. Lindsay and Jamie, the White team captains, are in charge of organizing all the girls, raising their spirits and motivating the team. But it\u0027s difficult to hold your first pep rally within the confines of a vow of silence. Under the vow, only team captains are allowed to talk.","After the flag raising on the first morning, the vow of silence is lifted. And then you realize why it was instituted in the first place. What follows are three days of solid wall-of-sound screaming. The girls cheer at the individual and team competitions. They cheer while standing around and waiting for their events to begin. They cheer on the way to the mess hall, they cheer outside the mess hall, and they cheer on the way back from the mess hall. They have constant team meetings where they talk about the importance of cheering.","But some of the girls, the older girls, are having a hard time cheering.","Lexie is on the White team. She\u0027s a Bryn Mawr, was eligible to be a Color Days captain, and spent the last night crying. Because if being chosen for Color Days captain means you\u0027re a leader, an intelligent and caring person who looks out for other people, what does it mean if you\u0027re not chosen?","Over the next two days, it\u0027s basically what you\u0027d expect an all-camp competition would be like. The younger girls and older girls split off. They do track and field events, swimming and boating events, scavenger hunts, and an all-camp songfest. Both teams seem pretty evenly matched, and for the most part, the girls win and lose with grace. Most of the girls I talk with all say Color Days is their favorite part of camp. They like the cheering. They like the games. They like feeling a part of a team.","[CROWD CHANTING AND CHEERING]","","But one night, after an intense capture the flag game, where Blue team pulls it off by one point, one of the White team girls doesn\u0027t take the loss too well.","The climax of Color Days is on the last night of camp, the obstacle course relay, where every member of each team takes part. Usually, whoever wins the relay wins the Color Days. The Blue team gathers at their meeting spot on the go-kart track to organize all of the team members for the race. Certain things are clear. Alissa Strom does the longest run. Carly Siegel always does the math problem. Rebecca Stern rules the pie eating contest. But there are some open spots, which require careful consideration.","After dinner, the captains and the two peanut butter and jelly sandwich eaters gather at the flagpole to begin the race that will last over an hour.","The relay race goes all over camp. One camper has to wait for the runner with the baton, then jump in the shower, wash her hair, get out, and passes the baton to the next runner, who goes to the waterfront, where a little girl will do 25 jumping jacks with a life jacket on, who then passes the baton to another girl, who goes all the way back to the other side of camp to a cabin, where a camper unmakes and makes a bed. All along the way, the girls are yelling for their teams, jumping up and down, and trying to control their nerves.","As an outsider watching three days of all of this, I have to say what was shocking was how gung ho everyone was. Camp is this unusually safe bubble where kids can let themselves go, crying and screaming and singing. They all buy into this. None of them stands back. Nobody thinks they\u0027re too cool for it. Back at school, the rules are completely different. Everywhere the rules are completely different.","[CHEERING]","","Down at the waterfront, the White and Blue teams stand side by side with dueling cheering, waiting for the final leg of the relay race. When the last baton is passed, the two captains from each team have to build a fire under a rope that\u0027s suspended between two sticks about 3 feet off the ground. The first team whose rope catches fire and burns all the way through wins the race. Some Bryn Mawr girls have been saving wood for the burn-the-rope since the second day of camp.","Tonight, the Blue team has about a full two minutes on the Whites as the runner hands off the baton. The Blue team captains, Carley and Dana, drop to their knees and begin with the kindling. They get only one match a minute as they add twigs and sassafras to the fire.","[CHEERING]","","Soon the White team starts on their fire. The captains\u0027 hands are shaking. Both teams are jumping up and down, cheering and hugging. The first pile of sticks to become like a real fire is the White team\u0027s, and the moment it catches, tears start streaming down Carley and Dana\u0027s cheeks on the Blue team. Both look close to hyperventilating as they lie down on the dirt, their cheeks on the ground, blowing on their fire, crying and frantically moving sticks around. But the White team\u0027s fire rises, their rope starts burning, and once it snaps, the race is pretty much over.","[SCREAMING AND CHEERING]","","Girls are jumping up and down, collapsing into each other\u0027s arms, sobbing and laughing. The younger girls, it\u0027s almost as if their little bodies can\u0027t take all this emotion. I watch one girl, about eight years old, who stands off to the side, begins to tremble, and her face gets redder and redder as tears pour down her cheeks. A teammate tries to comfort her. It\u0027s OK, she says, we won.","It might seem strange, standing in the middle of a hundred crying girls, that most of them will tell you this is the best day of camp. But it\u0027s the best day of camp precisely because it\u0027s a hundred girls all crying together. If the point of camp is to feel this camaraderie, to feel like you belong to something, that feeling is at its most concentrated during Color Days. This is also the last day of camp.","I talk to Jamie Stream and Lexie Cowurtz. Jamie\u0027s been here for seven years and can\u0027t come back as a camper again. Lexie starts high school this year, and for her, this isn\u0027t just the last day of camp, her last day living in this safe little bubble.

One of the cofounders of the Boy Scouts of America ran a camp in 1901 in which he organized boys into a make-believe tribe called the Sinaways. The Red Man is the apostle of outdoor life, he wrote back then. His example and precept are what young America needs today, above any other ethical teaching-- Indianness and a real connection to nature, an appreciation for all that was being lost with industrialization and urbanization.","Just one generation after Custer\u0027s Last Stand, fake Indianness was an integral part of the early Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations in this country. By 1910, camps with names like Camp Minnewawa, Camp Miramichi, Camp Pokanoket were springing up everywhere for middle-class and upper-class children. It is still a big part of camping all across America. And after a year without powwow, Camp Lake of the Woods brought the powwow back.","Most of this simply has to do with tradition.

And in addition, it\u0027s part of what makes camp thrilling. It is using all of the stagecraft that all the world\u0027s religions have always used, the ceremonies, the chanting, the repeated words, the official honors and offices, but for an entirely secular purpose-- to thrill children, to make them feel part of something big and special.","Well, coming up, war.

You let them know about all the extra rights and privileges and honors that they\u0027re going to get if they return as older campers.","Note number four, Ritual.

A few of the girls hold their palms up in the air and say, how. They launch into these fake, pidgin English sentences where they drop lots of verbs and add \"um\" to the ends of the words.","Before you continue, can I just say that it\u0027s really interesting that you can\u0027t even tell the story without suddenly bursting into song.","In fact, fake Indianness has been a part of camping in America since organized camping began a century ago. One of the cofounders of the Boy Scouts of America ran a camp in 1901 in which he organized boys into a make-believe tribe called the Sinaways. The Red Man is the apostle of outdoor life, he wrote back then. His example and precept are what young America needs today, above any other ethical teaching-- Indianness and a real connection to nature, an appreciation for all that was being lost with industrialization and urbanization.","Just one generation after Custer\u0027s Last Stand, fake Indianness was an integral part of the early Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations in this country. By 1910, camps with names like Camp Minnewawa, Camp Miramichi, Camp Pokanoket were springing up everywhere for middle-class and upper-class children. It is still a big part of camping all across America. And after a year without powwow, Camp Lake of the Woods brought the powwow back.","It is part of making the business run.

I mean, she\u0027d talk to a girl on the White team and everything. And all I could think was, if you have to say something like that, you know there\u0027s going to be trouble. The speculation about who will get the honor of being captain of the Color Days team, the biggest honor at camp, is so intense that, weeks before Color Days begins, Lindsay Sayowitz and some friends in Bryn Mawr East decide to consult Lindsay\u0027s Ouija board.","Everyone thinks Alissa\u0027s a shoe-in. And the Ouija board also picked Jamie Stream, another favorite, and Lindsay Sayowitz, who, coincidentally, had her hands on the Ouija pointer at the time.","Two weeks later, in the middle of the night, all the girls\u0027 counselors snake through the cabin area with lit kerosene torches and wake up the girls for the opening ceremonies of Color Days 1998.","Little girls stumble out onto the sidewalks, rubbing their eyes, wearing mismatched shoes and looking confused. Across the way, the Bryn Mawr girls have never even gone to sleep, anticipating this moment when they find out which one of them will be named Color Days captain. They stand with their faces pressed up to the screen door of their cabin, holding hands and silently crying. Counselors with torches lead 120 girls. They march down to the lakefront and surround an enormous bonfire 10 feet high. It looks like some cross between a debutante ball and a Klan rally.","Like a summer stock Grecian play, one of the counselors dressed in a white toga comes out of the forest and stands behind the fire.","The spirit for the Blue team, another counselor in a toga, appears before the fire and talks about blue and blueness. Candles are lit, and the girls vow to abide by the camp\u0027s seven virtues during Color Days. Those virtues? Friendship, determination, sportsmanship, tolerance, enthusiasm, patience, and unity.","Finally, the camp director, Dayna, picks up four whistles, two on a white string and two on blue. This is the moment everyone\u0027s been waiting for and guessing about, the moment Dayna remembers so well from 16 years ago when she was at Bryn Mawr. She walks behind all the girls to the last row, where the Bryn Mawr sit, and silently places the necklaces over the heads of the girls selected to be the captains of Color Days 1998.","[SOBBING]","","The chosen girls stand up, sob, and cling to each other. The other girls stay seated, sob, and cling to each other. It turns out the Ouija board was only right about one of the captains, Lindsay Segenreich. Alissa and Jamie looked shocked and heartbroken. There\u0027s so much crying, some of the girls can barely walk straight as they stumble back to their cabins after the ceremony. Because of the vow of silence, there are lots of sniffles, gasps, and blowing noses. Color Days hasn\u0027t even started yet.","It\u0027s the next morning, and the White team has gathered for their first team meeting. The veteran campers are dressed entirely in white-- white shoes, shirts, socks, bandannas. Their faces are painted white. Their hair is painted white. Lindsay and Jamie, the White team captains, are in charge of organizing all the girls, raising their spirits and motivating the team. But it\u0027s difficult to hold your first pep rally within the confines of a vow of silence. Under the vow, only team captains are allowed to talk.","After the flag raising on the first morning, the vow of silence is lifted. And then you realize why it was instituted in the first place. What follows are three days of solid wall-of-sound screaming. The girls cheer at the individual and team competitions. They cheer while standing around and waiting for their events to begin. They cheer on the way to the mess hall, they cheer outside the mess hall, and they cheer on the way back from the mess hall. They have constant team meetings where they talk about the importance of cheering.","But some of the girls, the older girls, are having a hard time cheering.","Lexie is on the White team. She\u0027s a Bryn Mawr, was eligible to be a Color Days captain, and spent the last night crying. Because if being chosen for Color Days captain means you\u0027re a leader, an intelligent and caring person who looks out for other people, what does it mean if you\u0027re not chosen?","Over the next two days, it\u0027s basically what you\u0027d expect an all-camp competition would be like. The younger girls and older girls split off. They do track and field events, swimming and boating events, scavenger hunts, and an all-camp songfest. Both teams seem pretty evenly matched, and for the most part, the girls win and lose with grace. Most of the girls I talk with all say Color Days is their favorite part of camp. They like the cheering. They like the games. They like feeling a part of a team.","[CROWD CHANTING AND CHEERING]","","But one night, after an intense capture the flag game, where Blue team pulls it off by one point, one of the White team girls doesn\u0027t take the loss too well.","The climax of Color Days is on the last night of camp, the obstacle course relay, where every member of each team takes part. Usually, whoever wins the relay wins the Color Days. The Blue team gathers at their meeting spot on the go-kart track to organize all of the team members for the race. Certain things are clear. Alissa Strom does the longest run. Carly Siegel always does the math problem. Rebecca Stern rules the pie eating contest. But there are some open spots, which require careful consideration.","After dinner, the captains and the two peanut butter and jelly sandwich eaters gather at the flagpole to begin the race that will last over an hour.","The relay race goes all over camp. One camper has to wait for the runner with the baton, then jump in the shower, wash her hair, get out, and passes the baton to the next runner, who goes to the waterfront, where a little girl will do 25 jumping jacks with a life jacket on, who then passes the baton to another girl, who goes all the way back to the other side of camp to a cabin, where a camper unmakes and makes a bed. All along the way, the girls are yelling for their teams, jumping up and down, and trying to control their nerves.","As an outsider watching three days of all of this, I have to say what was shocking was how gung ho everyone was. Camp is this unusually safe bubble where kids can let themselves go, crying and screaming and singing. They all buy into this. None of them stands back. Nobody thinks they\u0027re too cool for it. Back at school, the rules are completely different. Everywhere the rules are completely different.","[CHEERING]","","Down at the waterfront, the White and Blue teams stand side by side with dueling cheering, waiting for the final leg of the relay race. When the last baton is passed, the two captains from each team have to build a fire under a rope that\u0027s suspended between two sticks about 3 feet off the ground. The first team whose rope catches fire and burns all the way through wins the race. Some Bryn Mawr girls have been saving wood for the burn-the-rope since the second day of camp.","Tonight, the Blue team has about a full two minutes on the Whites as the runner hands off the baton. The Blue team captains, Carley and Dana, drop to their knees and begin with the kindling. They get only one match a minute as they add twigs and sassafras to the fire.","[CHEERING]","","Soon the White team starts on their fire. The captains\u0027 hands are shaking. Both teams are jumping up and down, cheering and hugging. The first pile of sticks to become like a real fire is the White team\u0027s, and the moment it catches, tears start streaming down Carley and Dana\u0027s cheeks on the Blue team. Both look close to hyperventilating as they lie down on the dirt, their cheeks on the ground, blowing on their fire, crying and frantically moving sticks around. But the White team\u0027s fire rises, their rope starts burning, and once it snaps, the race is pretty much over.","[SCREAMING AND CHEERING]","","Girls are jumping up and down, collapsing into each other\u0027s arms, sobbing and laughing. The younger girls, it\u0027s almost as if their little bodies can\u0027t take all this emotion. I watch one girl, about eight years old, who stands off to the side, begins to tremble, and her face gets redder and redder as tears pour down her cheeks. A teammate tries to comfort her. It\u0027s OK, she says, we won.","It might seem strange, standing in the middle of a hundred crying girls, that most of them will tell you this is the best day of camp. But it\u0027s the best day of camp precisely because it\u0027s a hundred girls all crying together.

Well, a few weeks ago, we invited your stories about camp. And you responded, so many of you, with so many great camp stories. Here is a selection."},{"speakerName":"Woman 1","text":"When I was five, my parents got divorced, and my father remarried the day after. In fact, he eloped to South Dakota because, in Minnesota, you had to wait six months between your divorce and remarriage. And then when I was eight, my mom died, and we were adopted by a nice, young couple, my sister and brother and I."},{"speakerName":"Woman 1","text":"And I remember one year, we went to a long weekend type of religious camp. It was sponsored through our church, but it had counselors there from a lot of different churches. And there was this one guy there that looked just like my dad. And I must have been, I don\u0027t know, nine and a half, 10. I was convinced that that was my father and that he had realized the error of his ways. And I had imagined that there must be some prohibition on him contacting the kids after he put them up for adoption, and I just thought this was his way of checking on us."},{"speakerName":"Woman 1","text":"And I would say things, like leading statements like, do you remember when I was little and you fixed my dolly, Peaches? Well, of course, he just looked at me like I was nuts. I mean, he must have thought, what an odd little girl. But I was sure. And I told my sister, Tracy, isn\u0027t that Dad? And she said, no, of course not. But I was sure. Somehow, it made me feel better, as strange as that seems. For that long weekend, that was my dad."},{"speakerName":"Woman 2","text":"My mother emigrated to the United States from Germany in the \u002750s, and her understanding of American culture and traditions wasn\u0027t always quite clear. And one of her confusions was about summer camp. She knew that kids should go to summer camp, but she didn\u0027t realize that it usually involved 24-hour adult supervision. So one week, she drove us up to a campground on the coast of Malibu and set us up in this tent and left us some groceries, and then she drove home to go back to work."},{"speakerName":"Woman 2","text":"And so I was left in charge of my brothers, and I was 12 and my brothers were 10 and 7. And we were at summer camp. We played in the ocean. We played in the little stream that ran by our campsite. We picked things and tried to figure out whether they were edible. And the only problem that we had, really, was that we had to keep it a secret that our parents weren\u0027t there, and this involved lots of stealth and subterfuge. We would notice that campers were looking over in our direction at some point and kind of wondering where our parents were."},{"speakerName":"Woman 2","text":"So in the morning, when we got ready to go to the beach, I would unzip the tent and yell into the tent, bye, Mom, bye, Dad. We\u0027re going to the beach, see you later and hope that we\u0027d be overheard doing this. And my brothers kind of picked up on this, so one of them, when he would see a man in a car driving out of the campground, if he was alone, he would yell after him, bye, Dad. Don\u0027t forget the Popsicles, as if the guy in the car were going to get us some groceries. We were pretty obsessed with groceries."},{"speakerName":"Woman 2","text":"And a week later, my mom came back. We had called her and told her how much we hated summer camp. And she thought that we were extremely spoiled because we didn\u0027t appreciate this great outdoor experience that was obviously a big part of American life."},{"speakerName":"Adina","text":"The first year I went, I was 10 years old. And that was a kind of a fluke because my parents were very committed left-wingers, and they wouldn\u0027t let me join the Girl Scouts because my mother called them a bunch of little brown shirts. And they wouldn\u0027t let me go to a fashionable summer camp because they didn\u0027t believe in fashion. So my father asked a friend where his kids went, and his kids went to this very left-wing, Zionist camp. And so they got me in."},{"speakerName":"Adina","text":"But we had, one day at lunchtime, a rock came through the window of the dining hall. And it landed in my soup, and there was a note wrapped around the rock. And it said, we don\u0027t want no Jew camps in Wisconsin. And so, of course, being a highly political group of people, they got together, and they had discussions, and they went on and on. And they posted guards. We had to paint our faces black so we wouldn\u0027t show up at night, and so on."},{"speakerName":"Adina","text":"And so a bunch of us were sitting in the dining hall, and somebody said, look, out on the lawn. And there was this large cross burning out on the lawn of the campgrounds. And these people came in, and they were all wearing white sheets, and they had these white things over their heads like pillowcases. And they made us all go outside, and there was another guy in a white sheet and a white pillowcase riding up and down on a horse."},{"speakerName":"Adina","text":"And they started to yell at us that they wanted the lousy Jews out of Wisconsin and that they didn\u0027t want no Jew camps in Wisconsin. And they said, don\u0027t bother trying to call the authorities because in this neck of the woods, we are the authorities. And everybody was just petrified."},{"speakerName":"Adina","text":"And we all stood around, shaking in our boots, and all of a sudden, one of the counselors said, I\u0027m an American citizen. You can\u0027t treat me like this. So two of the guys in sheets grabbed him by the arms and marched him away. And another counselor said, I\u0027m an American citizen. You can\u0027t treat us like this."},{"speakerName":"Adina","text":"And pretty soon, all the counselors were being marched away, and we were all left there. And I got really frightened. So I went, I\u0027m an American citizen too. And somebody came over in a white sheet and took me down towards the beach. And as he was marching me down to the beach, he said to me, Adina, couldn\u0027t you have kept your big mouth shut? And it was all a political lesson that we were supposed to be learning."},{"speakerName":"Woman 3","text":"Anyway, I was seven, and it was church camp. And several men dressed in black holding machine guns entered the chapel at different areas. They immediately tied the hands of the four pastors on stage and held a gun on the main pastor."},{"speakerName":"Woman 3","text":"I think as soon as the man said, if you\u0027re a Christian, stand up, the devoted stood, and the rest just ran off. And there were kids running all over the woods. And as we walked to our cabin, we saw counselors with flashlights and bullhorns proclaiming it was only a play. We heard kids yelling and cursing and crying, and it was pretty bad."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Thanks to everybody who called. Thanks to everybody who wrote."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Note number four, Ritual. Down by the lake, some of the Bryn Mawr girls explained it all to me. Every year it\u0027s the same-- same songs, same ceremonies. There\u0027s Circle and Olympic Days. There\u0027s Color Days. There\u0027s Mohawk privileges and cabin nights. And there\u0027s the dance where the girls choose a boy who they\u0027ll marry for one day. And there\u0027s the powwow."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Last year, first session, they took powwow away from us because it was politically incorrect or something. And we were all really upset because powwow was one of our biggest camp traditions, because we have a little song or whatever in the beginning. And it\u0027s--"},{"speakerName":"Girls","text":"[SINGING CHANT]"},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"And you do different hand motions and everything to it, and it\u0027s really fun. And then you challenge other teams. It\u0027s fun. But then--"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Before you continue, can I just say that it\u0027s really interesting that you can\u0027t even tell the story without suddenly bursting into song."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[CHUCKLING]"},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Our camp sings a lot."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Besides the singing, powwow includes a talent competition. One girl, her talent-- she crosses her eyes."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"And Jolie can, like, snap her belly button."},{"speakerName":"Jolie","text":"Aw, I\u0027m wearing a bathing suit."},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"I can sing all the vowels in \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\" And you just do weird talents, and you challenge other teams."},{"speakerName":"Girl 3","text":"At the end, if your team is the best, you get a peace feather."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"The reason it got taken away last year was because a lot of the counselors felt that it was politically incorrect because the speeches that the Indians make are derogatory towards Native American culture, if you look at it that way."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I asked for examples. A few of the girls hold their palms up in the air and say, how. They launch into these fake, pidgin English sentences where they drop lots of verbs and add \"um\" to the ends of the words."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"We go to Lake-um of the Woods-um Camp-um."},{"speakerName":"Girl 4","text":"Live-um in Vassar East-um. I teach-um camper naps how to walk-um on water-um. Inside jokes [INAUDIBLE] put into with adding stuff that Indians or whatever."},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"They\u0027re just so funny that it\u0027s not even-- no one even really thinks about it like that."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In fact, fake Indianness has been a part of camping in America since organized camping began a century ago. One of the cofounders of the Boy Scouts of America ran a camp in 1901 in which he organized boys into a make-believe tribe called the Sinaways. The Red Man is the apostle of outdoor life, he wrote back then. His example and precept are what young America needs today, above any other ethical teaching-- Indianness and a real connection to nature, an appreciation for all that was being lost with industrialization and urbanization."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Just one generation after Custer\u0027s Last Stand, fake Indianness was an integral part of the early Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations in this country. By 1910, camps with names like Camp Minnewawa, Camp Miramichi, Camp Pokanoket were springing up everywhere for middle-class and upper-class children. It is still a big part of camping all across America. And after a year without powwow, Camp Lake of the Woods brought the powwow back."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Most of this simply has to do with tradition. The special songs and ceremonies are a part of so many American camps, and it\u0027s not just because they\u0027re fun. A camp director in Wisconsin told us as we were putting together today\u0027s program that, financially, you cannot run a camp without lots of repeat customers. These traditions bring kids back year after year. You have the kids singing constantly about their loyalty to their cabinmates and their camp. You let them know about all the extra rights and privileges and honors that they\u0027re going to get if they return as older campers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It is part of making the business run. And in addition, it\u0027s part of what makes camp thrilling. It is using all of the stagecraft that all the world\u0027s religions have always used, the ceremonies, the chanting, the repeated words, the official honors and offices, but for an entirely secular purpose-- to thrill children, to make them feel part of something big and special."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"I think it\u0027s a really important part of camp. I mean, I personally-- I like the traditions because you know what\u0027s going to happen, and you can trust things that--"},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"You expect it."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Girl 3","text":"I come back for the traditions. I expect everything to be here the way it was last year because that\u0027s the reason I come back. If everything changed, I don\u0027t think I would like it anymore."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, coming up, war. What is it good for? Answers. Also, the second mention of the Israeli Army in one radio show. That\u0027s in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Notes on Camp-- summer camp. A lot of the pleasure of being in camp is the pleasure of being part of this team, this group that you just feel loyal to, which also happens to be one of the pleasures of being in the military, since ancient times."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, Adam Davidson is half Israeli, grew up in America. And when he was 15, he went to a camp run by the Israeli Army in Israel on their own training facilities. The campers ran the same drills. They shot M16s. It was all designed to convince these American Jews to move to Israel and join the Israeli Army someday."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"It\u0027s so exciting because you really feel-- I mean, you know-- that at that age, when you\u0027re 15, and you\u0027re in Israeli Army summer camp, there is no one in the history of the world who is cooler than an elite army unit soldier. I loved the fact that we would go to the bathroom, and the toilets wouldn\u0027t have a seat because that\u0027s a place where terrorists could put a bomb. And it just felt so macho crouching on top of the seat and showering in this freezing cold water. Because what? (IN ISRAELI ACCENT) A Sayeret Matkal would need hot water? Why?"},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"Now for me, for the first few weeks, what was tough about this was that I was really a nobody there, and I\u0027d always be bringing up the rear. I\u0027d always be kind of slow. And I wasn\u0027t showing myself to be macho even though there were so many opportunities in a given day to prove yourself macho."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"I mean, we were always, for no apparent reason, running like crazy from one tree to another tree, or up some mountain every few minutes, or something you could be the best at. And I was never the best."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"But all of this changed. My geek status was completely transformed. One night, the different units would put on plays, and we were supposed to do take-offs of fairy tales. And this was some kind of a competition. There was voting over who did the best job."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"So my group, [INAUDIBLE], our fairy tale was Steve White and the Seven Dwarfs. And I would be Steve White, this fabulous gay man who lives with these seven dwarfs, and the prince who comes to rescue me would be Rambo."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"This was one of those moments where I just knew that I was in the zone. I was in my element. I mean, I was from Greenwich Village. I had been an actor all through my childhood. My dad was an actor."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"But more than that, there\u0027s a way that Americans can be very free that Israelis can\u0027t be, precisely because they have to be macho. And no matter what they\u0027re doing, even if they\u0027re mocking themselves, they have to maintain that studliness. And I had no obligations in that area."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"I dressed myself just-- I tried not to be too outrageous, but I had to be kind of outrageous for them to get it. So a little bit of rouge, a little bit of eyeliner, my hair kind of slicked back with mousse, and sort of ridiculously short shorts."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"And so I\u0027m lying there, and I hear a knock on the door. And I just stand up, and I remember the entire crowd is howling, just howling. And I just do the most awful, mincing gay voice, just who is it?"},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"And my friend, who was a skinhead from Toronto whose parents happened to be Israeli, says, it\u0027s Rambo. And I say, oh, Rambo, you sexy beast. And everyone is freaking out, just laughing like mad, like maniacs. And of course, throughout it all, I\u0027m making jokes about the camp members themselves, like saying, oh, I think Commander Oloney is just the thing. And everything I say, the entire crowd is just with me, is just laughing hysterically."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"And what happens to Snow White-- to Steve White-- I eat the apple, I pass out, and I need to be resuscitated. So Rambo comes to kiss me, and what we had worked out is he put his hand in front of his mouth, and I put my hand in front of my mouth, and we just touched hands. And we\u0027r kissing our mouths, but from a distance, it looks like we\u0027re making out."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"And I mean, at this point, the camp, they\u0027re standing up, they\u0027re howling. I mean, I have transgressed every boundary that the Israeli man sets for himself, and they are loving the other side."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"And from that point on, I was no longer the unknown American bringing up the rear of the obstacle course. I was like a movie star. I mean, everyone-- the Israeli guys, particularly the macho-est, toughest Israeli guys, constantly wanted to do this make out thing where we put our hands over our mouths and make out."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"We\u0027d be relaxing after some really long hike in the Negev Desert or something, and Nehtyu or Shaoul or whatever would come up to me and say, (IN ISRAELI ACCENT) it\u0027s very funny the way you do this make out thing. Show me do it. Let\u0027s do it."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"And the first few times I would do it. I mean, I guess part of me was flattered that, like, the macho future Sayeret Matkal guys were into me in any way. But after a while, it was just so weird. I\u0027d just be like, look, Shaoul, I\u0027m just not going to do that. I don\u0027t do that anymore. I\u0027m just not going to do it. And they\u0027d be like, (IN ISRAELI ACCENT) why not? Do it. It\u0027s very funny, that\u0027s all. It\u0027s not for anything, but just the funny."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"Now, I\u0027ve been to plenty of camps, and in every camp, you\u0027re somehow a part of a team. I remember in Boy Scout camp when I was at horse riding camp, it was the people who rode horses in the morning versus the people who rode horses in the afternoon. And I just loved my guys, and I would look in the lunchroom at the other bunk and just-- I just didn\u0027t understand how you could even live in that bunk."},{"speakerName":"Adam Davidson","text":"But Israeli Army summer camp is the purest distillation I\u0027ve ever seen of this joy in being a part of the group. Every week, I would do things that I wouldn\u0027t have thought I could possibly do, and that was so incredible. And I knew that was because of the group. I knew that was giving me the force. And there was never a moment where I had to ask myself, can I do it? It was just, we\u0027re doing this. [INAUDIBLE] is going to do this."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Adam Davidson is now a member of our Planet Money team. Though he intended to join the Israeli Army when he was 15, it never worked out."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Note on Camp number six, Color Days. It is impossible to overstate what a big deal Color Days is at the camp in Michigan Julie Snyder and I visited. It is like any Color Wars at any camp, except that it\u0027s three days, and once you\u0027re assigned a team-- a Blue team or a White team for girls, Black or Red for boys-- you will stay on that team all your years at camp. There are legacies. Your brothers and sisters will be on the same team as you are."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Being named a captain of the Color Days teams is considered such a big deal that many older campers can name all the captains of all their Color Day teams going back years. Two girls and two boys are named as captain each year for each team. Only campers from the oldest bunks can be captain. Bryn Mawr is for girls, Mohawks and Blackhawks for boys."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Counselors who were once named as captains, if you talk to them about it, they get all choked up when they tell you about the moment they were chosen. Even Dayna Hardin, the 29-year-old owner of the camp, went into this long explanation of the ceremony with me at one point, her voice cracking, ending with--"},{"speakerName":"Dayna Hardin","text":"Oh, I\u0027m almost in tears right now. [LAUGHS] I really am, because, I mean, it was the biggest honor in my life."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Julie Snyder watched the girls Color Days this year."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Just to give you a sense of the intensity of Color Days, a month before it all begins, an 11-year-old Blue team member tells me Color Days isn\u0027t all that competitive. I mean, she\u0027d talk to a girl on the White team and everything. And all I could think was, if you have to say something like that, you know there\u0027s going to be trouble. The speculation about who will get the honor of being captain of the Color Days team, the biggest honor at camp, is so intense that, weeks before Color Days begins, Lindsay Sayowitz and some friends in Bryn Mawr East decide to consult Lindsay\u0027s Ouija board."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay Sayowitz","text":"Is anyone here?"},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Hello? Who is this? B-L-A-I-R. Blair."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay Sayowitz","text":"Our old friend."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Blair? We talk to her a lot. OK."},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"Do you know who the Color Days captains are for girls? Could you name one of them? OK."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"A-L-I-S-S-A. Alissa. Alissa Strom."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay Sayowitz","text":"She\u0027ll get it, I bet."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Everyone thinks Alissa\u0027s a shoe-in. And the Ouija board also picked Jamie Stream, another favorite, and Lindsay Sayowitz, who, coincidentally, had her hands on the Ouija pointer at the time."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Two weeks later, in the middle of the night, all the girls\u0027 counselors snake through the cabin area with lit kerosene torches and wake up the girls for the opening ceremonies of Color Days 1998."},{"speakerName":"Counselor","text":"Girls, it\u0027s time to wake up. Everybody up out of bed. Get a pair of pants on, shoes on. Wake up, [INAUDIBLE]."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Little girls stumble out onto the sidewalks, rubbing their eyes, wearing mismatched shoes and looking confused. Across the way, the Bryn Mawr girls have never even gone to sleep, anticipating this moment when they find out which one of them will be named Color Days captain. They stand with their faces pressed up to the screen door of their cabin, holding hands and silently crying. Counselors with torches lead 120 girls. They march down to the lakefront and surround an enormous bonfire 10 feet high. It looks like some cross between a debutante ball and a Klan rally."},{"speakerName":"Counselor 1","text":"We are here tonight to usher in our three days of competition known as Color Days. I call forth the first spirit. Do you hear me, O spirit? Come forth and tell us who you are and why you are here."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Like a summer stock Grecian play, one of the counselors dressed in a white toga comes out of the forest and stands behind the fire."},{"speakerName":"Counselor 2","text":"I am the spirit of the white. I represent the clouds of a summer\u0027s day, white caps in the water, and the dove of peace and purity."},{"speakerName":"Counselor 1","text":"What is the message you bring, O white spirit?"},{"speakerName":"Counselor 2","text":"It is a difficult thought to convey, but rich in meaning in every way. One can\u0027t find peace in a world of dream. Each person is a fraction, a part of the team. We have no choice, everyone must belong. If no one is weak, can the team be strong?"},{"speakerName":"Counselor 1","text":"I call forth the next spirit. Do you hear me, O spirit?"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"The spirit for the Blue team, another counselor in a toga, appears before the fire and talks about blue and blueness. Candles are lit, and the girls vow to abide by the camp\u0027s seven virtues during Color Days. Those virtues? Friendship, determination, sportsmanship, tolerance, enthusiasm, patience, and unity."},{"speakerName":"Counselor 1","text":"In order that you may have time to consider carefully the meaning of these next few days, we ask that you now take a vow of silence. Please repeat after me. I will be silent."},{"speakerName":"Campers","text":"I will be silent."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Finally, the camp director, Dayna, picks up four whistles, two on a white string and two on blue. This is the moment everyone\u0027s been waiting for and guessing about, the moment Dayna remembers so well from 16 years ago when she was at Bryn Mawr. She walks behind all the girls to the last row, where the Bryn Mawr sit, and silently places the necklaces over the heads of the girls selected to be the captains of Color Days 1998."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"[SOBBING]"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"The chosen girls stand up, sob, and cling to each other. The other girls stay seated, sob, and cling to each other. It turns out the Ouija board was only right about one of the captains, Lindsay Segenreich. Alissa and Jamie looked shocked and heartbroken. There\u0027s so much crying, some of the girls can barely walk straight as they stumble back to their cabins after the ceremony. Because of the vow of silence, there are lots of sniffles, gasps, and blowing noses. Color Days hasn\u0027t even started yet."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"OK, for those who don\u0027t know yet, I\u0027m Jamie."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay","text":"I\u0027m Lindsey."},{"speakerName":"Beth","text":"I\u0027m Beth."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay","text":"And we have an awesome team. I\u0027m so excited."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"It\u0027s the next morning, and the White team has gathered for their first team meeting. The veteran campers are dressed entirely in white-- white shoes, shirts, socks, bandannas. Their faces are painted white. Their hair is painted white. Lindsay and Jamie, the White team captains, are in charge of organizing all the girls, raising their spirits and motivating the team. But it\u0027s difficult to hold your first pep rally within the confines of a vow of silence. Under the vow, only team captains are allowed to talk."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"OK, are you guys excited? Just nod your head."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay","text":"Just like that."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"After the flag raising on the first morning, the vow of silence is lifted. And then you realize why it was instituted in the first place. What follows are three days of solid wall-of-sound screaming. The girls cheer at the individual and team competitions. They cheer while standing around and waiting for their events to begin. They cheer on the way to the mess hall, they cheer outside the mess hall, and they cheer on the way back from the mess hall. They have constant team meetings where they talk about the importance of cheering."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay","text":"You guys, cheering tonight is the most important night to cheer. That\u0027s why--"},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"Cheer so loud. You guys, it is not normal if you don\u0027t lose your voices."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay","text":"White team, listen! This is really important."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"This is really important, you guys. Really important."},{"speakerName":"Lindsay","text":"Trying your best is the most important thing right now."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"You run your butt over here as fast as you can because it is so important that you guys don\u0027t miss any of our meetings."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"[CROWD CHANTING AND CHEERING]"},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"But some of the girls, the older girls, are having a hard time cheering."},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"It is really hard to get in on it, because I\u0027m telling people to be louder because I know they\u0027re not being loud enough, but yet, I can\u0027t do it myself."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Lexie is on the White team. She\u0027s a Bryn Mawr, was eligible to be a Color Days captain, and spent the last night crying. Because if being chosen for Color Days captain means you\u0027re a leader, an intelligent and caring person who looks out for other people, what does it mean if you\u0027re not chosen?"},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"I didn\u0027t expect it, but I really, really wanted captain. And I mean, it is a disappointment because it\u0027s something that you\u0027re eligible for. And if you don\u0027t get it, then you think about, or at least I think about, what I did to not do it and what I did wrong and how I\u0027m not as decent as a person as other people. And it\u0027s just-- I mean, it\u0027s a letdown, but it\u0027s not everything. And that\u0027s what a lot of people lose grip of. That\u0027s what I always lose grip of, is that it\u0027s not everything, as much as it means. But it means a lot."},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"[CROWD CHANTING AND CHEERING]"},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Over the next two days, it\u0027s basically what you\u0027d expect an all-camp competition would be like. The younger girls and older girls split off. They do track and field events, swimming and boating events, scavenger hunts, and an all-camp songfest. Both teams seem pretty evenly matched, and for the most part, the girls win and lose with grace. Most of the girls I talk with all say Color Days is their favorite part of camp. They like the cheering. They like the games. They like feeling a part of a team."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"[CROWD CHANTING AND CHEERING]"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"But one night, after an intense capture the flag game, where Blue team pulls it off by one point, one of the White team girls doesn\u0027t take the loss too well."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"White team, can I talk to you for a second? You guys, the Blue team is playing very dirty, and none of us should play like that at all. They knew I was already over, and yet they still felt that they needed to trip me."},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"But just don\u0027t complain about it. We\u0027re just going to kill them tonight."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"No, I say we get them back right now by screaming so loud that they will have to plug their ears because that is how upset I am right now."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"The climax of Color Days is on the last night of camp, the obstacle course relay, where every member of each team takes part. Usually, whoever wins the relay wins the Color Days. The Blue team gathers at their meeting spot on the go-kart track to organize all of the team members for the race. Certain things are clear. Alissa Strom does the longest run. Carly Siegel always does the math problem. Rebecca Stern rules the pie eating contest. But there are some open spots, which require careful consideration."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"OK. First person--"},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"Shh, you guys.

Absolutely amazing. Do you have any idea how much it takes to keep up with Lexie?"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"The relay race goes all over camp. One camper has to wait for the runner with the baton, then jump in the shower, wash her hair, get out, and passes the baton to the next runner, who goes to the waterfront, where a little girl will do 25 jumping jacks with a life jacket on, who then passes the baton to another girl, who goes all the way back to the other side of camp to a cabin, where a camper unmakes and makes a bed. All along the way, the girls are yelling for their teams, jumping up and down, and trying to control their nerves."},{"speakerName":"Girl 1","text":"Oh, I am so scared right now. I am, like, here, but I\u0027m not. I\u0027m, like, somewhere else. Go Blue."},{"speakerName":"Girl 2","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"As an outsider watching three days of all of this, I have to say what was shocking was how gung ho everyone was. Camp is this unusually safe bubble where kids can let themselves go, crying and screaming and singing. They all buy into this. None of them stands back. Nobody thinks they\u0027re too cool for it. Back at school, the rules are completely different. Everywhere the rules are completely different."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"[CHEERING]"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Down at the waterfront, the White and Blue teams stand side by side with dueling cheering, waiting for the final leg of the relay race. When the last baton is passed, the two captains from each team have to build a fire under a rope that\u0027s suspended between two sticks about 3 feet off the ground. The first team whose rope catches fire and burns all the way through wins the race. Some Bryn Mawr girls have been saving wood for the burn-the-rope since the second day of camp."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Tonight, the Blue team has about a full two minutes on the Whites as the runner hands off the baton. The Blue team captains, Carley and Dana, drop to their knees and begin with the kindling. They get only one match a minute as they add twigs and sassafras to the fire."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"[CHEERING]"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Soon the White team starts on their fire. The captains\u0027 hands are shaking. Both teams are jumping up and down, cheering and hugging. The first pile of sticks to become like a real fire is the White team\u0027s, and the moment it catches, tears start streaming down Carley and Dana\u0027s cheeks on the Blue team. Both look close to hyperventilating as they lie down on the dirt, their cheeks on the ground, blowing on their fire, crying and frantically moving sticks around. But the White team\u0027s fire rises, their rope starts burning, and once it snaps, the race is pretty much over."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"[SCREAMING AND CHEERING]"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":""},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Girls are jumping up and down, collapsing into each other\u0027s arms, sobbing and laughing. The younger girls, it\u0027s almost as if their little bodies can\u0027t take all this emotion. I watch one girl, about eight years old, who stands off to the side, begins to tremble, and her face gets redder and redder as tears pour down her cheeks. A teammate tries to comfort her. It\u0027s OK, she says, we won."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"It might seem strange, standing in the middle of a hundred crying girls, that most of them will tell you this is the best day of camp. But it\u0027s the best day of camp precisely because it\u0027s a hundred girls all crying together. If the point of camp is to feel this camaraderie, to feel like you belong to something, that feeling is at its most concentrated during Color Days. This is also the last day of camp."},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"It\u0027s strange. It\u0027s this whole thing, there\u0027s so many things to deal with. And then it\u0027s just all jumbled in at once, and it\u0027s confusing and-- I don\u0027t know."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"I talk to Jamie Stream and Lexie Cowurtz. Jamie\u0027s been here for seven years and can\u0027t come back as a camper again. Lexie starts high school this year, and for her, this isn\u0027t just the last day of camp, her last day living in this safe little bubble. In a way, it\u0027s her last day of childhood."},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"One camp summer has never meant so much to me now that we\u0027re getting older. And I\u0027m so frightened of going into high school that I don\u0027t want to leave here anyway, but I\u0027m so secure here. It\u0027s such a haven for me that I can\u0027t imagine going home."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"Also, I think it\u0027s hard, maybe not for you, but for me, since this is my last year, these are my last, like, three days of ever being a camper. And it\u0027s so weird. It\u0027s like, this is my last Tuesday at camp. This is my last dinner with my cabin. This is my last time ever being in a cabin with my friends. And that\u0027s what\u0027s so weird about it because you\u0027re just thinking about the last this, last that."},{"speakerName":"Jamie","text":"I\u0027m kind of scared to go home, in a way, because my friends at home are so different from my friends here, and it\u0027s going to be scary."},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"They\u0027re so dull. I don\u0027t mean that as in like-- I mean, I love my friends to death. But when you think of the things that we go through here, we\u0027re not really living at home. We go to school, and we go out. And It\u0027s not their fault, but the environment is so different that it\u0027s dull living at home."},{"speakerName":"Lexie","text":"I\u0027m perfectly content here just sitting here getting mail. I don\u0027t really care as long as I just-- it\u0027s so strange. And I\u0027m going to miss walking-- I was just talking to Lauren [INAUDIBLE] about this. I\u0027m going to miss walking down the path. I\u0027m going to miss the doors slamming. I\u0027m going to miss the overflowing bathrooms.
