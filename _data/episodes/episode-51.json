        "I have a cat at home. He had leukemia. He got cancer, he got lymphosarcoma. He has tumors and he\u0027s building up with fluid. And we did a special new surgery. We put a tube inside him. And twice a day, I use that tube to pull fluid out of him. He\u0027s in no pain and he purrs constantly. He just purrs and purrs and purrs, and he eats. And the most important thing is to make him well. And even then, it\u0027s only for a few months. I mean, you know he\u0027s going to get it eventually. And I said, it\u0027s amazing, but we only really pay that kind of attention and that kind of devotion to them when they\u0027re in that kind of trouble.",
        "That could be it. My wife has another answer. She says when they\u0027re that close to death, they become perfect. And that\u0027s the attraction. I don\u0027t know. They\u0027re becoming-- they know more. All of a sudden, they know. They know what\u0027s going on. They know here and beyond and they know what the hell we\u0027re doing caught up in the middle of the two. And they know something. And whatever it is, it changes them. And they become worth more if that\u0027s possible. I don\u0027t know. Just give them every shot. And let me see what\u0027s going on out there.",

        "I guess I can\u0027t stand the suffering of an animal. An animal looks up at you, and to me, I can feel what he\u0027s feeling as a human little thing. Or there\u0027s something going on. I don\u0027t just see a furry thing. I see the eyes and I get right into the feelings of the animal. And something affects me and I have to do something about it. I don\u0027t have that empathy, maybe, with people. Or maybe I don\u0027t allow it, to have that with people. Because somehow people can take care of themselves. These guys can\u0027t. These animals can\u0027t. So I see that and I have to do something about it. But I won\u0027t draw the line.",
        "See, I can\u0027t go to the pound. I have meetings with the director, the whole set up out here. I can\u0027t go to the pound. He has to meet me in a coffee shop. Because if I go to the pound, I\u0027m going to walk through, look at every animal, take every dog that\u0027s ready to be killed that day and bring them to the shelter. I can\u0027t do that. But I will. So for me, I know the weakness. The weakness is don\u0027t communicate. Don\u0027t be there. Just be removed. I can\u0027t go over the next hill if I don\u0027t have the room.",
        "Still, there\u0027s just this thing inside of me that pulls me and I go into the next hill. And I find things all the time. I always find somebody when I do that. And this is my code. And this is the way I live. My one message to animals is if you\u0027re hungry or if you\u0027re hurt, cross my path. That\u0027s my message. And since the day I said that, I was in Hollywood, I told you, and I\u0027m walking down the street and cats are jumping out in front of me ever since then.",
        "I mean, my friends, nobody has this problem. I go down the street and they pop out of everywhere. And they\u0027re limping or they\u0027re hungry or whatever. And that makes me feel OK that I don\u0027t have to worry about did I miss one. Because I\u0027ll say, no, he\u0027s OK because he didn\u0027t cross my path.",
        "And it is the same way, it\u0027s the same thing when you have one that\u0027s very sick, making the same decision. You tell me, what am I supposed to do? I don\u0027t want you to suffer, but if you can make it, and do you want to make it, and all these other things being considered. And still, even then, it has to be suffering with absolutely no prognosis.",
        "I have a dog at home that I got and it had distemper. It ended up this dog lost the use of its rear legs. The vet said put her down. No way, she lost the front legs. Now I\u0027m carrying her in and out five times, six times a day. At night, I\u0027m waking up twice to flip her over because she can\u0027t move. She had a heating pad on. She couldn\u0027t regulate her heat.",
        "Everybody except my wife that heard about it said it\u0027s insane. We just stopped letting people know. The vet said, \"How\u0027d that dog do?\" I said, \"Oh, we put her down.\" I didn\u0027t tell them. Six weeks, I did this, back and forth. Because she wanted to make it. There was just something about her. One day, when I\u0027m bouncing her up and down on her feet so she can get muscle tone, I\u0027m bouncing her, and she\u0027s just limp. And all of a sudden, a foot goes out to get her balance.",
        "And it was the best thing-- Bailey put a foot out. Two weeks later, she could walk. Now she\u0027s running, tearing up. We\u0027ve had her a year and a half now of tearing up everything. I mean, she\u0027s just-- she always remembers that she was appealing to live. And she just needed somebody to give her the chance. I give them everything I can if they want to make it. If they want to live, there\u0027s something about it, they fight. I fight with them."

I mean, my guess would be that since there are tons of colophons, that is, little inscriptions in the back, saying \"Oh, I\u0027m so pleased to have done this for you, God. This was wonderful.

        "A friend of mine, a classical pianist I know, had a dream that he was sleeping in his own room when something woke him up. Gathering at the foot of his bed was every animal he had ever even. They were just looking at him, breathing quietly. They pushed in closer and closer around his bed as more kept coming. Then when the room was full, the ones that came first started to file out through the bathroom door. And for the rest of the dream, each animal in turn simply paused by my friend\u0027s bed, looked at him, and passed on by to make room for the next one."

I mean, my guess would be that since there are tons of colophons, that is, little inscriptions in the back, saying \"Oh, I\u0027m so pleased to have done this for you, God. This was wonderful. It was worth all the time.\" So probably they thought that it was great for the animal too. The animal was serving God just like they were by being in a book.",

They might change their tune if they ever spoke with Ellen Burtomly regarding the beautiful night we spent at her brother Bob\u0027s cottage.

Before it started getting to me, I\u0027d bring boot-loads of quarters and a special bottom cushion and watch hours and hours of Scandinavian women romping. It was shameful. Finally, last Christmas, I said enough is enough. I\u0027d rather be sexless than evil. And since then, I have been. Sexless and good, but very, very tense.",

When mocked, which is nearly every day, I recall Christ covered with spittle. When filled with lust, I remember Gandhi purposely sleeping next to a sexy teen to test himself. After work, I go home, watch a little TV, maybe say a rosary or two. 30 more years of this and I\u0027m out of it without hurting anybody or embarrassing myself.",
            "Sadly, I find my feelings for Frieda returning. I must have a death wish. Clearly I repulse her. Sometimes I catch her looking at my gut overhangs with a screwed-up face. I see her licking her lips while typing and certain unholy thoughts go through my head. I hear her speaking tenderly on the phone to her little son Len and can\u0027t help picturing myself sitting on a specially reinforced porch swing while she fries up some chops and Len digs in the muck.",
            "Today as we prepare a mailer, she says she\u0027s starting to want to be home with Len all the time. But there\u0027s the glaring problem of funds. She makes squat. I\u0027ve seen her stub. There\u0027s the further problem that she suspects Mrs. Rasputin, Len\u0027s babysitter, is a lush. \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" Frieda says. I come home after work and she\u0027s sitting there tipsy in her bra, fanning herself with a racing form. Before I know what I\u0027m saying, I suggest that perhaps we should go out for dinner and offer each other some measure of comfort.",
            "In response, she spits her Tab out across her cubicle. She says now she\u0027s heard it all. She goes to fetch Tim and Claude so they can join her in guffawing at my nerve. She faxes a comical note about my arrogance to her girlfriend at the DMV. All afternoon, she keeps looking at me with her head cocked. Needless to say, it\u0027s a long day.",
            "Then at 5:00, after everyone else is gone, she comes shyly by and says she\u0027d love to go out with me. She says I\u0027ve always been there for her. She says she likes a man with a little meat on his bones. She says pick her up at 8:00 and bring something for Len. I\u0027m shocked. I\u0027m overjoyed. My knees are nearly shaking my little desk apart.",
            "I buy Len a football helmet and a baseball glove and an aquarium and a set of encyclopedias. I basically clean out my pitiful savings. Who cares? It\u0027s worth it to get a chance to observe her beautiful face from across a table without Claude et al. hooting at me.",
            "When I ring her bell, someone screams, \"Come in.\" Inside, I find Len behind the home entertainment center and Mrs. Rasputin drunkenly poring over her grade school yearbook with a highlighter.",
            "At noon, another load of raccoons comes in, and Claude takes them out back of the office and executes them with a tire iron. Then he checks for vitals wearing protective gloves. Then he drags the cage across 209 and initiates burial by dumping the raccoons into the pit that\u0027s our little corporate secret. After burial comes prayer, a personal touch that never fails to irritate Tim, our ruthless CEO.",
            "She looks up and says, \"Where\u0027s that kid?\"",
            "I feel like saying, \"How should I know?\" Instead I say, \"He\u0027s behind the home entertainment center.\"",
            "\"He loves it back there,\" she says. \"He likes eating the lint balls. They won\u0027t hurt him. They\u0027re like roughage.\"",
            "\"Come out, Len,\" I say. \"I have gifts.\" He comes out. One tiny eyebrow cocks up at my physical appearance. Then he crawls into my lap holding his Mega Death Dealer by the cowl. What a sweet boy. The Dealer\u0027s got a severed human head in its hand. When you pull the string, the Dealer cries, \"You\u0027re dead and I\u0027ve killed you, Prince of Slime,\" and sticks its Day-Glo tongue out. I give Len my anti-violence spiel. I tell him only love can dispel hate. I tell him we were meant to live in harmony and give one another emotional support. He looks at me blankly then flings his Death Dealer at the cat.",
            "Frieda comes down looking sweet and casts a baleful eye on Mrs. Rasputin and away we go. I take her to Ace\u0027s Volcano Island. Ace\u0027s is an old service station now done up Hawaiian. They\u0027ve got a tape loop of surf sounds and some Barbies in grass skirts climbing a paper mache mountain. I purposely starve myself.",
            "We talk about her life philosophy. We talk about her hair style and her treasured childhood memories and her paranormally gifted aunt. I fail to get a word in edgewise, and that\u0027s fine. I like listening. I like learning about her. I like putting myself in her shoes and seeing things her way.",
            "I walk her home. Kids in doorways whistle at my width. I handle it with grace by shaking my rear. Frieda laughs. A kiss seems viable. It all feels too good to be true. Then on her porch, she shakes my hand and says great, she can now pay her phone bill, courtesy of Tim. She shows me the written agreement. It says, \"In consideration of your consenting to be seen in public with Jeffrey, I, Tim, will pay you, Frieda, the sum of $50.\"",
            "I take a weekend vacation and play Oilcan Man nonstop. I achieve level nine. At the end of night three, I step outside for some air. Up in the sky are wild clouds that make me think of Tahiti and courageous sailors on big sinking wooden ships. Meanwhile, here\u0027s me, a grown man with a joystick burn on his thumb.",
            "So I throw the game cartridge in the trash and go back to work. I take the ribbing, I take the abuse. Someone snipped my head out of the office folder and mounted it on a bride\u0027s body. Tim says, what the heck, the thought of the visual incongruity of our pairing was worth the $50.",
            "\"Do you hate me?\" Frieda asks.",
            "Before founding Humane Raccoon Alternatives, Tim purposely backed his car over a frat boy and got 10 to 12 for manslaughter. In jail, he earned his MBA by designing and marketing a line of light-up Halloween lapel broaches. Now he gives us the broaches as performance incentives and sporadically trashes a bookshelf or two to remind us of his awesome temper and of how ill-advised we\u0027d be to cross him in any way whatsoever.",
            "\"No,\" I say, \"I truly enjoyed our evening together.\"",
            "\"God, I didn\u0027t,\" she says. \"Everyone kept staring at us. It made me feel bad about myself that they thought I was actually with you. Do you know what I mean?\" I can\u0027t think of anything to say so I nod. Then I retreat moist-eyed to my cubicle for some invoicing fun.",
            "I\u0027m not a bad guy. If only I could stop hoping. If only I could say to my heart, \"Give up. Be alone forever. There\u0027s always opera. There\u0027s angel food cake and neighborhood children caroling and the look of autumn leaves on a wet roof.\" But no. My heart\u0027s some kind of idiotic fishing bobber. My invoices go very well. The sun sinks, the moon rises, brown and pale as my stupid face.",
            "I minimize my office time by volunteering for the Carlisle entrapment. The Carlisles are rich. A poor guy has a raccoon problem, he sprinkles poison in his trash and calls it a day. Not the Carlisles. They dominate bread routes throughout the city. Carlisle supposedly strong-armed his way to the top of the bread heap, but in person, he\u0027s nice enough.",
            "I let him observe me laying out the rotten fruit. I show him how the cage door coming down couldn\u0027t hurt a flea. Then he goes inside and I wait patiently in my car. Just after midnight, I trip the wire. I fetch the Carlisles and encourage them to squat down and relate to the captured raccoon. Then I recite our canned speech congratulating them for their advance thinking. I describe the wilderness where the release will take place, the streams and fertile valleys, the romp in the raccoon\u0027s stride when it catches its first whiff of pristine air.",
            "Mr. Carlisle says thanks for letting him sleep at night sans guilt. I tell him that\u0027s my job. Just then, the raccoon\u0027s huge mate bolts out of the woods and tears into my calf. I struggle to my car and kick the mate repeated against my wheel well until it dies with my leg in its mouth. The Carlisles stand aghast in the carport. I stand aghast in the driveway, sick at heart. I\u0027ve trapped my share of raccoons and helped Claude with more burials than I care to remember, but I\u0027ve never actually killed anything before.",
            "I throw both coons in the trunk and drive myself to the emergency room, where I\u0027m given the first of a series of extremely painful shots. I doze off on a bench post-treatment and dream of a den of pathetic baby raccoons in V-neck sweaters yelping for food. When I wake up, I call in. Tim asks if I\u0027m crazy kicking a raccoon to death in front of clients. Couldn\u0027t I have gently lifted it off, he asks, or offered it some rotting fruit? Am I proud of my ability to screw up one-car funerals?",
            "I tell Tim I\u0027m truly sorry I didn\u0027t handle the situation more effectively. He says the raccoon must\u0027ve had a said last couple of minutes once it realized it had given up its life for the privilege of gnawing on a shank of pure fat. That hurts. Why I continue to expect decent treatment from someone who\u0027s installed a torture chamber in the corporate basement is beyond me. Down there, he\u0027s got a Hide-A-Bed and a whip collection and an executioner\u0027s mask with a built-in Walkman. Sometimes when I\u0027m invoicing late, he\u0027ll bring in one of his willing victims. Usually, they\u0027re both wasto.",
            "I get as much of me under my desk as I can. Talk about the fall of man. Talk about some father somewhere being crestfallen if he knew what his daughter was up to. Once I peeked out as they left and saw a blonde with a black eye going wherever Tim pointed and picking up his coat whenever he purposely dropped it. How do people get like this? I thought. Can they change back? Can they learn again to love and be gentle? How can they look at themselves in the mirror or hang Christmas ornaments without overflowing with self-loathing?",
            "Then I thought, I may be obese, but at least I\u0027m not cruel to the point of being satanic. The next day, Tim was inducted into Rotary and we all went to the luncheon. He spoke on turning one\u0027s life around. He spoke on the bitter lessons of incarceration. He sang the praises of America and joked with balding, sweetheart ophthalmologists and after lunch hung his Rotary plaque in the torture chamber stairwell and ordered me to Windex it daily or face extremely grim consequences.",
            "Post-burial, I write up the invoices and a paragraph or two on how overjoyed the raccoons were when we set them free. Sometimes I\u0027ll throw in something about spontaneous mating beneath the box elders. No one writes a better misleading letter than me. In the area of phone inquiries, I\u0027m also unsurpassed. When a client calls to ask how their release went, everyone in the office falls all over themselves transferring the call to me. I\u0027m reassuring and joyful. I laugh until tears run down my face at the stories I make up regarding the wacky things their raccoon did upon gaining its freedom.",
            "Tuesday, a car pulls up as Claude and I approach the burial pit with the Carlisle raccoons. We drag the cage into a shrub and squat, panting. Claude whispers that I smell. He whispers that if he weighed 400, he\u0027d take into account that people around him and go on a diet. A pale girl in a sari gets out of the car and walks to the lip of the pit. She paces off the circumference and scribbles in a notebook. She takes photos. She slides down on her rear and comes back up with some coon bones in a baggy. After she leaves, we rush back to the office.",
            "Tim\u0027s livid and starts baby-oiling his trademark blackjack. He says no more coons in the pit until further notice. He says we\u0027re hereby in crisis mode and will keep the coons on blue ice in our cubicles and if need be, wear nose clips. He says the next time she shows up, he may have to teach her a lesson about jeopardizing our meal ticket. He says animal rights are all well and good, but there\u0027s a big difference between a cute bunny or cat and a disgusting raccoon that thrives on carrion and trash and creates significant sanitation problems with its inquisitiveness.",
            "\"Oh, get off it,\" Claude says, affection for Tim shining from his dull eyes. \"You\u0027d eliminate your own mother if there was a buck in it for you.\"",
            "\"Undeniably,\" Tim says, \"especially if she knocked over a client trash can or turned rabid. Then he hands me the corporate Visa and sends me to Hardware Niche for coolers.",
            "When I get back to the office, everyone\u0027s gone for the night. The Muzak\u0027s off for a change and loud wax and harsh words are floating up from the basement via the heat ducts. Before long, Tim tromps up the stairs swearing. I hide pronto. He shouts thanks for nothing and says he could have had more rough and tumble fun dangling a cat over a banister, that there\u0027s nothing duller than a clerk with the sexual imagination of a grape.",
            "\"Document placement and retrieval specialist,\" Frieda says in a hurt tone.",
            "\"Whatever,\" Tim says and speeds off in his Porsche.",
            "I emerge overwhelmed from my cubicle. Over her shoulder and through the plate glass is a shocked autumnal moon. Frieda\u0027s cheek is badly bruised. Otherwise, she\u0027s radiant with love. My mouth hangs open. \"What can I say?\" she says. \"I can\u0027t get enough of the man.\"",
            "\"Good night,\" I say and forget about my car and walked the nine miles home in a daze.",
            "All day Wednesday, I prepare to tell Tim off, but I\u0027m too scared. Plus he could rightly say she\u0027s a consenting adult. Instead, I drop a few snots in his coffee cup and use my network access privileges to cancel his print jobs. He asks can I work late, and in spite of myself, I fawningly say sure. I hate him. I hate myself.",
            "Then, as per Tim, I ask if they\u0027d mind sending back our promotional materials. The brochures don\u0027t come cheap. They show glossies of raccoons in the wild contrasted with glossies of poisoned raccoons in their death throes. You lay that on a housewife with perennially knocked-over trash cans and she breathes a sigh of relief. Then she hires you and you get a 10% commission.",
            "Everybody else goes home. Big clouds roll in. I invoice like mad. Birds light on the dumpster and feed on substances caked on the lid. What a degraded cosmos. What a case of something starting out nice and going bad.",
            "Just after 7:00, I hear him shout, \"You, darling, will rot in hell with the help of a swift push to the grave from me.\" At first, I think he\u0027s pillow talking with Frieda by phone. Then I look out the window and see the animal rights girl at the lip of our pit with a camcorder. Tim runs out the door with his blackjack unsheathed.",
            "What to do? Clearly, he means her harm. I follow him, leaving behind my loafers to minimize noise. I keep to the shadows and scurry in my socks from tiny berm to tiny berm. I heave in an unattractive manner. My heart rate\u0027s in the ionosphere. To my credit, I\u0027m able to keep up with him. Meanwhile, she\u0027s struggling up the slope with her hair in sweet disarray, backlit by a moon the color of honey, camcorder on her head like some kind of Kenyan water jug.",
            "\"Harlot,\" Tim hisses, \"attempted defiler of my dream,\" and whips his blackjack down. Am I quick? I am so quick. I lunge up and take it on the wrist. My arm bone goes to mush and my head starts to spin and I wrap Tim up in a hug the size of Tulsa.",
            "\"Run,\" I gasp to the girl and see in the moonlight the affluent white souls of her fleeing boat-type shoes. I hug hard. I tell him drop the jack, and to my surprise, he does. Do I then release him? To my shame, no. So much sick rage is stored up in me. I never knew. And out it comes in one mondo squeeze and something breaks and he goes limp and I lay him gently down in the dirt.",
            "I CPR like anything. I beg him to rise up and thrash me. I do a crazy little dance of grief. But it\u0027s no good. I\u0027ve killed Tim.",
            "I sprint across 209 and ineffectually drag my bulk around Industrial Grotto, weeping and banging on locked corporate doors. United Knee Wrap\u0027s having a gala. Their top brass are drunkenly lip-synching hits of the \u002750s en masse and their foot soldiers are laughing like subservient fools, so no one hears my frantic knocking. I prepare to heave a fake boulder through the plate glass.",
            "But then I stop. By now, Tim\u0027s beyond help. What do I gain by turning myself in? Did I or did I not save an innocent girl\u0027s life? Was he or was he not a cruel monster? And standing there outside the gala, I learned something vital about myself. When push comes to shove, I could care less about lofty ideals. It\u0027s me I love. It\u0027s me I want to protect. Me.",
            "These days, commissions are my main joy. I\u0027m too large to attract female company. I weigh 400. I don\u0027t like it, but it\u0027s beyond my control. I\u0027ve tried running and rowing the stationary canoe and Hatha yoga and belly staples and even a muzzle back in the dark days when I had it bad for Frieda, our document placement and retrieval specialist. When I was merely portly, it was easy to see myself as a kind of exuberant sportsman who overate out of lust for life. Now, no one could possibly mistake me for a sportsman.",
            "I hustle back to the office for the burial gear. I roll Tim into the pit. I sprinkle on lime and cover him with dirt. I forge a letter in which he claims to be going to Mexico to clarify his relationship with God via silent meditation and a rugged desert setting. \"My friends,\" I write through tears in his childish scrawl, \"you slave away for minimal rewards. Freedom can be yours if you open yourself to the eternal. Good health and happiness to you all. I\u0027m truly sorry for any offense I may have given. Also, I have thought long and hard on this and have decided to turn over the reins to Jeffrey whom I have always wrongly maligned. I see now that he is a man of considerable gifts and ask you all to defer to him as you would to me.\"",
            "I leave the letter on Claude\u0027s chair and go out to sleep in my car. I dream of Tim wearing a white robe in a Mexican cantina. A mangy dog sits on his lap explaining the rules of the dead. No weeping, no pushing the other dead, don\u0027t bore everyone with tales of how great you were. Tim smiles sweetly and rubs the dog behind the ears. He sees me and says no hard feelings and thanks for speeding him onto the realm of bliss.",
            "I wake with a start. The sun comes up driving sparrows before it, turning the corporate reflective windows wild with orange. I roll out of my car and brush my teeth with my finger. My first day as a killer.",
            "I walk to the pit in the light of fresh day hoping it was all a dream, but no. There\u0027s our scuffling footprints. There\u0027s the mound of fresh dirt, under which lies Tim. I sit on a paint can in a patch of waving weeds and watch my colleagues arrive. I weep. I think sadly of the kindly bumbler I used to be, bleary-eyed in the morning, guiltless and looking forward to coffee.",
            "When I finally go in, everyone\u0027s gathered stunned around the microwave. \"El Presidente,\" Claude says, disgustedly.",
            "\"Sorry?\" I say. I make a big show of shaking my head in shock as I read and reread the note I wrote. I ask if this means I\u0027m in charge. Claude says with that kind of conceptual grasp, we\u0027re not exactly in for salad days. He asks Frieda if she had an inkling. She says she always knew Tim had certain unplumbed depths, but this is ridiculous. Claude says he smells a rat. He says Tim never had a religious bone in his body and didn\u0027t speak a word of Spanish. My face gets red. Thank God Blamphin, that toady, pipes up.",
            "\"I say in terms of giving Jeffrey a chance, we should give Jeffrey a chance. In as much as Tim was a good manager but a kind of a mean guy,\" he says.",
            "\"Well put,\" Claude says cynically. \"And I say this fatty knows something he\u0027s not telling.\" I praise Tim to the skies and admit I could never fill his shoes. I demean my organizational skills and leadership abilities but vow to work hard for the good of all. Then I humbly propose a vote. Do I assume leadership or not? Claude says he\u0027ll honor a quorum, and then via show of hands, I achieve a nice one. I move my things into Tim\u0027s office.",
            "Because he\u0027d always perceived me as a hefty milquetoast with no personal aspirations, he trusted me implicitly. So I\u0027m able to access the corporate safe. I\u0027m able to cater in prime rib and a trio of mustachioed violinists who stroll from cubicle to cubicle hoping for tips.",
            "Claude\u0027s outraged. Standing on his chair, he demands to know what ever happened to the profit motive. He says one can\u0027t run a corporation on good intentions and blatant naivete. He pleads that the staff fire me and appoint him CEO. Finally, Blamphin proposes I can him. Torson from Personnel seconds the motion. I shrug my shoulders and we vote and Claude\u0027s axed. He kicks the water cooler, he gives me the finger, but out he goes, leaving us to our chocolate mousse and cocktails.",
            "When I\u0027ve finished invoicing, I enjoy a pecan cluster. Two, actually. Claude comes in all dirty from the burial and sees me snacking and feels compelled to point out that even my sub-rolls have sub-rolls. He\u0027s right, but still it isn\u0027t nice to say. Tim asks did Claude make that observation after having wild sex with me all night? That\u0027s a comment I\u0027m not fond of, but Tim\u0027s the boss. His T-shirt says, \"I hold your purse strings in my hot, little hand.\"",
            "By nightfall, the party\u0027s kicked into high gear. I bring in jugglers and a comedian and drinks, drinks, drinks. My staff swears their undying loyalty. We make drunken toasts to my health and theirs. I tell them we\u0027ll kill no more. I tell them we\u0027ll come clean with the appropriate agencies and pay all relevant fines. Henceforth, we\u0027ll relocate the captured raccoons as we\u0027ve always claimed to be doing. The company will be owned by us, the employees, who will come and go as we please. Day care will be available on site. Frieda brightens and sits on the arm of my chair.",
            "Muzak will give way to personal stereos in each cubicle. We will support righteous charities, take troubled children under our collective wing, enjoy afternoons off when the sun is high and the air sweet with the smell of mown grass. And when one of us finally has to die, we will have the consolation of knowing that, aided by corporate largess, our departed colleague has known his or her full measure of power, love, and beauty. And arm in arm, we will all march to the graveyard singing sad hymns.",
            "Just then, the cops break in led by Claude, who\u0027s holding one of Tim\u0027s shoes. \"If you went to Mexico,\" he shouts triumphantly, \"wouldn\u0027t you take your Porsche? Would you be so stupid as to turn your life\u0027s work over to this tub of lard? Things started to add up. I did some literal digging. And there I found my friend Tim with a crushed rib cage that broke my heart and a look of total surprise on his face.\"",
            "\"My Timmy,\" Frieda says, rising from my chair. \"This disgusting pig killed my beautiful boy.\" They cuff me and lead me away.",
            "In court, I tell the truth. The animal rights girl comes out of the woodwork and corroborates my story. The judge says he appreciates my honesty and the fact that I saved a life. He wonders why having saved a life, I didn\u0027t simply release Tim and reap the laurels of my courage. I tell him I lost control. I tell him a lifetime of scorn boiled over. He says he empathizes completely and says he had a weight problem himself when a lad. Then he gives me 50 as opposed to life without parole.",
            "So now I know misery. I know the acute discomfort of a gray jail suit pieced together from two garments of normal size. I know the body odor of Vic, a Chicago kingpin who\u0027s claimed me for his own and compels me to wear a feminine hat with fruit on the brim for nightly interludes. Do my ex-colleagues write? No. Does Frieda? Ha. Have I achieved serenity? No. Do I have a meaningful hobby that makes the days fly by like minutes? No.",
            "I have a wild desire to smell the ocean. I have a sense that God is unfair and preferentially punishes his weak, his dumb, his fat, his lazy. I believe he takes more pleasure in his perfect creatures and cheers them on like a brainless dad as they run roughshod over the rest of us. He gives us a need for love and no way to get any. He gives us a desire to be liked and personal attributes that make us utterly unlikable. Having placed his flawed and needy children in a world of exacting specifications, he deducts the difference between what we have and what we need from our hearts and our self-esteem and our mental health. This is how I feel. These things seem to be true. But what\u0027s there to do but behave with dignity, keep a nice cell, be polite but firm when Vic asks me to shimmy while wearing a hat, join in at the top of my lungs when the geriatric murderer from Baton Rouge begins his nightly spiritual?",
            "Maybe the God we see, the God who calls the daily shots is merely a sub-god. Maybe there\u0027s a God above this sub-god who\u0027s busy for a few God minutes with something else and will be right back and when he gets back will take the sub-god by the ear and say, \"Now look, look at that fat man. What did he ever do to you? Wasn\u0027t he humble enough? Didn\u0027t he endure enough abuse for 1,000 men? Weren\u0027t the simplest tasks hard? Didn\u0027t you sense him craving affection? Were you unaware that his days unraveled as one long bad dream?\"",
            "And maybe as this sub-god slinks away, the true God will sweep me up in his arms, saying, \"My sincere apologies. A mistake has been made. Accept a new birth as token of my esteem.\" And I will emerge again from between the legs of my mother a slighter and more beautiful baby, destined for a different life in which I am masterful, sleek as a deer, a winner.",
            "\"Haha, Tim,\" says Claude. \"I\u0027m no homo. But if I was one, I\u0027d die before doing it with Mr. Lard.\"",
            "\"Haha,\" says Tim. \"Good one. Isn\u0027t that a good one, Jeffrey?\""

Am I proud of my ability to screw up one-car funerals?"

Why I continue to expect decent treatment from someone who\u0027s installed a torture chamber in the corporate basement is beyond me. Down there, he\u0027s got a Hide-A-Bed and a whip collection and an executioner\u0027s mask with a built-in Walkman. Sometimes when I\u0027m invoicing late, he\u0027ll bring in one of his willing victims. Usually, they\u0027re both wasto."

            "Act Three, Dead Animal Man. It\u0027s our program on dead animals and on human thoughts. This next story is a story recorded during the summer, years ago, in Washington DC. Society has a deal with people in certain unpleasant jobs. It pays them money, and they handle disgusting smelling stuff so nobody else has to. Well, meet Clarence Hicks.",
            "OK, we\u0027re running across the highway now.",
            "What is it?",
            "It\u0027s all flat on one side.",
            "The cat\u0027s head was still normal, but the body was blackened and dissolving. Mr. hicks slid a pitchfork under the poor thing and carried it back to his truck, where he dropped it into a metal trash can in the back. It was hot. Summer is the busy season for dead animal catchers. More animals are outside so more are dead on the road. And then there\u0027s the smell to deal with. In the hot sun, the animals decompose fast.",
            "What sort of person does this kind of work? Clarence Hicks is 51 with a gray goatee. He has kids and grandkids, but no pets. Before taking this job a year and a half ago, he worked in other divisions in the Department of Sanitation, cleaning alleys, working at the city incinerator. He says this job is definitely a step up.",
            "Driving around alone.",
            "It\u0027s not very strenuous. Mostly Mr. Hicks stops by people\u0027s houses, picks up their dead pets, or dead animals in the neighborhood. Maybe a dozen a day. Few enough so he doesn\u0027t have to rush. A dispatcher gives him a list of animals and addresses over the radio.",
            "At one house, we were supposed to find a cat. But after looking in the street, in the backyard, everywhere, we only found a fish, 10 inches long, silver blue, in perfect condition, but dead.",
            "Maybe they got confused.",
            "Washington DC has three dead animal catchers in the Department of Sanitation. This week, I went out with Clarence Hicks.",
            "We had other stops. A cat under a tree, a dog covered with maggots. Over on 30th Place, we were called out for a squirrel.",
            "There it is.",
            "It took less than a minute.",
            "People have strong personal reactions to dead animals. A stranger wearing a white cap and a beeper just walked up to us and started talking.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Are you the person who called it in to the Department of Sanitation to pick this up?",
            "What highway are we on here?",
            "Back in the truck, Mr. Hicks said that in his job, you can\u0027t just throw the animals around. People will complain. You have to respect people\u0027s feelings about animals, be more funeral director than garbage man. Like yesterday, he said, when he picked up a woman\u0027s dog.",
            "What was this animal yesterday?",
            "So what did you do? What did you say?",
            "This is a big black dog.",
            "The next stop for us was the animal shelter, where ordinary people bring their animals to be put to sleep, as they say. Mr. Hicks and another animal man, William Daniels, put on aprons and gloves and carried five big, gray, plastic barrels of animals into the truck, 50 or 60 animals in all.",
            "And that garbage bucket had a couple of dogs, a couple cats.",
            "And now another dog.",
            "All the animals are taken to what Mr. Hicks calls \"The Box,\" a walk-in freezer near the city incinerator. There, the animals are lifted into metal oil barrels and left.",
            "Has this job changed the way that you see animals?",
            "Come on. I don\u0027t believe you. I feel like I see animals differently just from seeing those dogs in one of those gray, plastic--",
            "So you\u0027ve just picked up that--",
            "Well, that\u0027s a new point of view.",
            "I\u0027ll tell you, the next time I see a dog on the street, I\u0027m going to think to myself-- I\u0027m just going to remember what those dogs in the back of your truck looked like.",
            "They looked dead, yeah.",
            "Did you ever see those pictures of-- I guess it\u0027s the angel of death? You know, big black hood and a sickle, a guy holding a sickle? The Grim Reaper.",
            "Well, it shouldn\u0027t bother you because that\u0027s who you are for these dogs.",
            "That\u0027s you.",
            "Give them a decent disposal.",
            "A few times a week, a rendering company comes down from Baltimore to pick up the animals that Mr. Hicks has gathered and left in The Box. In Baltimore, these smelly creatures that nobody wants are changed into smelly things that people sell to each other, ingredients for perfume, fertilizer, stuff that ordinary folks can handle themselves.",
