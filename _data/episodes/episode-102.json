Over the last eight years I figure I\u0027ve ridden at least 100,000 miles on Greyhound. In total, about four solid months of my life have been spent cooped up in their buses. I would consider it my home away from home, if only I had a home.","What I like most about Greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on the bus. Airline passengers love to complain about the five excruciatingly long hours it takes to fly from coast to coast. But on the bus that same distance takes three full days to cover, which is what I think is about the perfect amount of time for such a trip. And unlike airplane flights, no movies are shown on Greyhound, no headsets handed out, no free magazines available. No waitresses force bags of peanuts on you every five minutes. On the bus, passengers are largely left alone with their thoughts.","I have this theory about people who ride Greyhound. About how, as we sit on the bus for hours and days, waiting to reach our destination, we travel in what I call a transitional state, thinking about where we\u0027re coming from and where we\u0027re going to. I know I do. And from my talking to other people on the bus, I know many others do as well.","For example, this one route I\u0027ve ridden a lot goes south through Crescent City, California, home of the Pelican Bay maximum security prison. I rode next to this guy who\u0027d been locked away for 14 years and had just gotten out. Across the aisle from me was a teenager with a buzz cut on his way to boot camp. We talked for a while, but mostly we just sat and thought about the different places we were headed.","For a long time I\u0027ve been wanting to tape record the stories I\u0027ve heard on the bus, to document this phenomenon that I\u0027ve been trying to figure out. So I was pretty excited when This American Life offered to send me on a Greyhound trip with a fancy tape recorder and a seven-day Ameripass. For a week, I could wander any Greyhound route I chose and test my theory about the bus.","So I packed up a loaf of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a bunch of bananas and stepped on a Greyhound.","I spent the first 10 hours traveling down the coast of Oregon. I was so eager to talk with the other passengers I stayed awake all night even though everyone else was sleeping. It wasn\u0027t until we stopped for breakfast in Crescent City that I was finally able to strike up a conversation. Steve was about 50 years old, sported a bushy beard and wore an olive green army jacket. A large wooden crucifix dangled from his neck. He said he was an itinerant preacher and that Greyhound was his chapel.","You avoid audiences. Then who are you talking to?","And Greyhound\u0027s conducive for your traveling ministry?","So normally your preaching on the bus would come with you just talking to the person sitting next to you?","Steve\u0027s ministry is not limited to the teachings of Christ but also included a healthy dose of praise for natural medicines, like cannabis and opium. I thought I was agreeing with him when I said that it did seem ridiculous that pharmaceutical companies simply sold nature back to us. But Steve took offense and pulled out a bottle of Anbesol, which he described as 60% grain alcohol plus benzocaine.","What\u0027s it for?","Chug a lug.","So is that numbing your whole mouth now?","Steve continued talking, but it became increasingly difficult to understand what he was saying as his speech slurred. By the end of our 15 minute talk he told me it was the longest conversation he had in the last three and a half years. Then Steve got on the northbound bus bound for Portland and I continued on to San Francisco.","From San Francisco I rode 10 hours to Los Angeles, sitting next to an 11-year-old kid that didn\u0027t want to talk to me. At the Hollywood bus station I saw a bus headed for San Francisco and figured, what the heck? Maybe I\u0027d get lucky on that bus. So I spent the next 10 hours retracing my route back north, sitting beside a guy who slept the whole way.","I had to wonder, where were all the talkers, all those chatty passengers that usually sit next to me and share their stories about where they\u0027re coming from or going to?","In Reno I switched to a bus route I\u0027ve always been curious about, the one that headed south through old mining towns down to Las Vegas. My attempts to find out who rode that particular bus led nowhere. I approached the other half dozen passengers one by one. But no one would talk to me.","On the bus from Las Vegas to Flagstaff, Arizona, I asked the woman sitting next to me if I could record our conversation for the radio. She acted like I was nuts. \"You want to talk to me about Greyhound for the radio? What radio station is that?\" \"Well,\" I explained, \"it\u0027s a show that\u0027s on different stations in different cities.\" \"What station is it on in Los Angeles then?\" she asked. \"Los Angeles, I\u0027m not sure.\" \"You want to record me for the radio, and you don\u0027t even know what station it is? Yeah, right,\" she\u0027s scoffed. \"Give me a break.\"","She alerted the other passengers around us that I was trying to pull something over on her. Soon I was verbally assaulted from all sides, the butt of everyone\u0027s jokes. I put the tape recorder away and stared out the window. My enthusiasm for this trip was rapidly dwindling.","At a rest stop I slinked away from the pack of passengers who were smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing me and stood off by myself. Maybe I\u0027d been wrong. Maybe there wasn\u0027t anything significant on the minds of Greyhound passengers after all. When the smoke break ended, I reluctantly got back on the bus.","On any bus there\u0027s usually some sort of outcast, like the drunk guy who smells like urine or the woman babbling to herself. Then it dawned on me. With these dorky headphones on my head, this foot long microphone in hand, trying to get people to let me interview them about where they\u0027re going, it was me. I was the weirdo on this bus.","Hello? Well, I guess since nobody else will talk to me on this bus and there are only a couple people on this bus and we\u0027ve got about nine more hours to go and it doesn\u0027t look like anybody else will be getting on the bus because we are in the middle of the desert. So I may as well talk to myself.","We are somewhere in the desert. I can see we\u0027re traveling under a clear blue sky. I can see about 30 miles. And a whole lot of dirt, rocks.","Um--","All these years I\u0027ve boasted of being some sort of hardy Greyhound passenger, impervious to all those things that many people complain about. The seemingly never ending rides, the annoying passengers, the claustrophobia. I mean, I sat next to a guy vomiting on himself and it\u0027s no big deal. I sat across the aisle from people having noisy sex and it didn\u0027t bother me. But now, on this trip, Greyhound was starting to get to me.","On the bus to Phoenix, I found myself wedged between the window and a guy who took up way too much of my seat. I tried to sleep for the first time in days but found that I couldn\u0027t. My whole body was sore. I had shooting pains in the back of my thighs. My back ached. I had a headache. The baby in front of me cried the whole way. The toddler behind me got smacked around for not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy. I was becoming increasingly claustrophobic. I was beginning to lose it.","Normally I survive long bus rides by concentrating on my destination, but now I didn\u0027t have a destination. I wasn\u0027t really going anywhere. How could I expect to find anyone in the transitional state when I wasn\u0027t even in transition myself? Maybe this was the problem with the whole mission. I had ceased being a regular Greyhound passenger. I was an outsider.","I stood in line for the bus to Las Cruces, New Mexico, trying to calm down. I thought I was in control until I watched a mother drag her kicking and crying toddler across the bus station by the kid\u0027s hair. I snapped. I couldn\u0027t take it. I couldn\u0027t handle being constantly surrounded by so many people anymore. I sure wasn\u0027t feeling at home like I usually do.","I stepped out of line for the Las Cruces bus. I had to get home. Sadly, Portland was still a 36-hour ride away.","At the Arizona-California border, a new passenger sat down across the aisle from me. Not needing any more abuse from strangers, I resisted my initial temptation to talk with her. A couple miles down the road I watched her pull a Polaroid photo from her purse, stare at it for a half minute, and then tuck it back in her purse. A minute later she had the photo out again and this time I snuck a peek and saw that it was a photo of her sitting in the lap of a guy wearing prison garb. Since she had boarded the bus in a prison town, I realized she had probably just visited a jailed boyfriend or husband.","Now she had to sit on the bus for who knows how many hours and dwell upon the person she had just left. At last, I thought, the one person I had been looking for on this whole trip. Someone in transition. Someone who could help me prove my theory about the bus. Her name was Lisa. And she was just as suspicious of me as any other passenger had been. But she did consent to let our conversation be recorded.","[INAUDIBLE]","The conversation didn\u0027t get very far. She gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions. Eventually she ended up asking me the majority of the questions. After a couple of awkward minutes, I put the microphone and tape recorder away. She stared at her photograph some more while I watched the desert in the fading sunlight.","A half hour later, after the bus had darkened and people dozed off, Lisa tapped me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandmother. Powers with which she could grant me any wish I desired. For this service she would only charge me $5.00. \"At my shop,\" she said, \"usually I charge $10, uh, $20 for a wish.\" She said it just like that. \"$10, uh, $20.\"","Well, $5 for a wish seemed like a bargain so I started counting up the hundreds of nickles I had won in a Las Vegas slot machine. But she said it would only work with a $5 bill. I didn\u0027t have any fives, but I did have a 10. \"A 10 will work,\" she said.","I followed her instructions, folding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her. She squeezed it in her fist and said, \"Now make a wish. But you can\u0027t tell anyone what it is.\" So I made a wish. Then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes. That these wishes were important, too, but not as important as the super important first wish. Well, in my state I only had one wish that I needed fulfilling, so I just made stuff up for the merely important second and third wishes, wishing for better health and a new romance.","On the dark bus she whispered across the aisle, assuring me that I was now in better health and that I could expect a new love in my life. Then she asked me to tell her my super important wish, my number one wish. \"But you told me not to tell me anyone,\" I said. \"You can tell me,\" she said, \"but don\u0027t tell anyone else.\"","So I told her I wished I wasn\u0027t riding the bus anymore. \"Oh,\" she said. \"You\u0027re tired of riding the bus. I can see it in your face that you\u0027re very tired. You have a kind face.\" She whispered about my face and described how tired I looked for five minutes, mentioning three times that while I might be laughing on the outside I was really crying on the inside. But I wasn\u0027t laughing, not even on the outside.","When she was done I watched her slip my 10 in her pocket. Meanwhile, I was still on the bus."],"spokenWords":["I have this theory about people who ride Greyhound.

There are those that make you feel like a person. Then there are the kind who make you feel like a blip. There\u0027s nothing wrong with a blip interview. In fact, it\u0027s liberating. You can say whatever you want to them. They will not remember you.","9 o\u0027clock Friday night, Moscow, Idaho. University Inn. We sit around in the common living room that connects George and Irving\u0027s bedrooms. George and Irving always get connected bedrooms, with a living room in between if they can. In the late afternoon when it\u0027s quiet, this is where George and Irving like to sit. They watch television. They read the trades.","Right now Morty\u0027s here. The sun is set and it\u0027s early evening. In general, they have three main topics of conversation, the act, the schedule, and where they want to eat. Here\u0027s some typical dialogue. Morty will say, \"Where should we eat?\" And Irving will say, \"The Broiler Room.\" That\u0027s the hotel steakhouse. And then George will say, \"John will know.\" John\u0027s the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove us to the hotel. And then Irving will say, \"I think we should do the Broiler Room.\" And then George will say, \"John will know. Ask John.\" And then Irving will say, \"I\u0027m making a reservation at the Broiler Room.\" But not moved towards the telephone. And on and on and on. It\u0027s like dialogue that David Mamet would write if David Mamet wrote scenes where absolutely nothing was at stake.","We head down to the Broiler Room. All through dinner there\u0027s this constant traffic of fans, including at one point four cheerleaders. They\u0027re wearing short skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the room. \"Go, George, Go!\" they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattle their crepe paper pom poms. Then, floor show over, they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine.","Then in comes the chef to ask for George\u0027s autograph. But George Burns likes these intrusions. He\u0027s nourished by them. When it\u0027s finally quite he says to me, \"Aren\u0027t people nice?\"","Because I\u0027m a reporter, I\u0027m a blip. But the public gets his full attention. He establishes eye contact with each approaching fan and he smiles at them and he asks how they\u0027re doing. And when he leaves the Broiler Room, he\u0027ll choose the most complicated route, slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room, touching people on the shoulder lightly, and saying things like, \"Don\u0027t pay the check.\"","While we\u0027re on the road I probably see him do his act five times. Each time it sounds totally spontaneous, like he\u0027s making it up right there, just riffing for the crowd, even though, give or take a gag or two, it\u0027s the exact same act he\u0027s been doing for 15 years.","What\u0027s amazing about all this is that on the surface the act doesn\u0027t seem to vary from city to city. But to George it\u0027s an eternal work in progress. Every night he makes microscopic changes. Maybe he\u0027ll decide to sing \"Young at Heart\" before \"Old Bones.\" When he does this, he gets all worked up about it, thinks about it all day long. But this is how he\u0027s been able to be on the road for so long. This is how he keeps the act feeling fresh for himself.","Sometimes he\u0027ll change a punchline. He has a gag in his act about people having to retire when they\u0027re 70. He says, \"When I was 70, I had pimples.\" But one day George tries out a new line on me. He says, \"When I was 70, I had cupid\u0027s eczema.\" I think that sounds sort of dirty, but I\u0027m not going to be the one to tell him. In fact, I have tape of this, of myself lying to the nicest man on earth.","Is that like, I don\u0027t know, young--","No.","Is it?","Oh. No it doesn\u0027t sound dirty.","A rash.","That\u0027s true.","George and Irving can go on like this for hours. They go back and forth and back and forth. And that night, George tries out the cupid\u0027s eczema line. It doesn\u0027t get laughs. On the way home in the car we\u0027re silent. George and a driver in the front. Me in the back, squeezed hip to elbow between Irving and Morty. Suddenly, George\u0027s rumbling voice cuts through the darkness. \"I\u0027ll never do that again,\" he says. It\u0027s quiet for a while more. \"Morty,\" he says, \"tomorrow night let\u0027s--\" and then the conversation starts all over again.","Normally when I think of going on the road, I think of waking up at any hour, of not having to be anywhere at a certain time. You\u0027re on a big adventure. The rules no longer apply. There\u0027s no accountability. But that\u0027s a civilian\u0027s road trip. I am on a very different kind of road trip.","The road trip I\u0027m on is not about adventure and unpredictability. The road trip I\u0027m on is about making sure that everything is the same. This is the secret to George Burns\u0027 longevity, of how he\u0027s been able to stay on the road for so long without going crazy. He wakes up at a certain time. He goes to sleep at a certain time.","When he goes on the road, he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning. When he agrees to a booking it\u0027s stipulated in his contract that he\u0027ll be provided with a backless stool to sit on, a lightly rehearsed orchestra, an ashtray to flick his ashes in, and a pre-show speed ball made up of a couple of martinis chased by a cup of black coffee. He will only smoke El Productos. In the afternoon he likes to take a two hour nap. He hates fresh fruit and vegetables.","By the end of our time together, I could order for him in a restaurant if necessary. He likes bay shrimp cocktails. He likes roast chicken. He likes his martinis, but doesn\u0027t care what brand of liquor they\u0027re made with. He just wants them to come one after the other. He is 92 and no one can tell him what is good or bad for him to put in his own mouth. Same goes for what comes out of it.","As the gin and vermouth kick in, his conversation tends to get naughty. One night he recites to me a particularly memorable limerick that involves a mouse, the phrase \"hickory dickory dock\" and a reference to his own private parts. Morty and Irving laugh, but I don\u0027t know what to do. If I laugh too hard, I\u0027m scared they\u0027re going to think I\u0027m some sort of slut girl. And if I don\u0027t, then I\u0027m a pill, no fun at all. I feel as if I\u0027m in another country with different customs and mores, and so I simply try every possible reaction one after the other, laughing, groaning, shaking my head, waiting for something that works.","The pace is very slow. I wake up in the morning, drink coffee, wait for Irving\u0027s call. Mostly I have free time. I lay on a variety of queen-sized beds in a variety of shag carpet hotel rooms and stare up at the ceiling.","One day Irving calls to invite me to talk to George as he eats breakfast.","Nah. I\u0027m just going to--","It\u0027s OK. I already had breakfast.","Yes, I did.","George is wearing a thick beige terry cloth bathrobe, beige pajamas, and slippers. His stiff grey toupee is somewhere in the other room. It\u0027s startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair, the stacked heeled shoes, the crisp tuxedo. He looks vulnerable, bird like.","I have this realization. This will be a man who I will get to know in the moments between words. Even on a road trip designed to avoid surprises, I find myself surprised by these men. My view of them comes to change as we spend more time together.","11:00 AM. Reno, Nevada, Bally\u0027s hotel. I\u0027m trying to keep my focus, but I\u0027m tired. Tired of the empty hours, tired of waiting for Irving to call. Whenever I call my boyfriend, his answering machine picks up. Finally I take the elevator to the hotel casino. I play the slot machines, mindlessly pulling down the handle. Somehow Irving finds me. I\u0027m playing the quarter slots. I\u0027m risking a grand total of $10, but he\u0027s positive that I will return home having handed over the title to my car. He goes away, then comes back and tells me it\u0027s time to quit. He goes away, then comes back 15 minutes later and tells me again. I\u0027m annoyed at his nagging, and touched. To save me from financial ruin, he asks me to take a walk with him.","Irving takes my hand and loops it past his bent elbow. Arm in arm, we stroll past places with names like The Mapes Hotel and the Liberty Bell Saloon. The way Irving is almost bouncing down the street lets me know he\u0027s enjoying that we come off like a mismatched couple, that I\u0027m his babe and he is my silver-haired, energetic sugar daddy.","Most of the time Irving does the talking. He tells me about his past. It\u0027s a history of 20th century show business, big jobs at CBS radio, in the movie studios. Jack Benny hired him to be the president of his production company. It\u0027s a long story. Every once in awhile, though, Irving asks me personal questions about my family, about my friends, about my boyfriend. And then we head back to the hotel.","And when we get to my room, he drops me off with this thought. He says, \"Leave your boyfriend. He\u0027s no good. Find someone else.\" And he walks away, and I stand there feeling conflicted. I think, I\u0027m no longer a blip to Irving, but who does he think he is? He doesn\u0027t know me. He\u0027s never met my boyfriend. A couple of years later I foll his advice. And every once in awhile I think back, trying to remember what it was that I said to him, what allowed him to distill this conclusion from my small talk. How come he knew something that took so long for me to figure out?","All I could come up with was how transparent I must have seemed to these men. Transparent like teenagers are to me. I mean, how many different human stories are there? These men had already been there.","Finally, we are on the road for so long that George is treating me like old news, which is where you want to be with George. When Irving lets me into George\u0027s suite before a show, George emerges from his room wearing shiny patent leather loafers, a crisp white shirt, a bow tie, and a knee-length paisley dressing down. He is pantless. He doesn\u0027t want to put on his tuxedo slacks until the very last minute so they don\u0027t lose their knife-sharp crease.","In the pocket of these pants is a watch chain. On the watch chain is Gracie\u0027s tiny gold wedding ring. The way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one true talent when he met Gracie Allen. And he stayed married to her for 38 years. He was the brains of the act, the one who wrote almost every word she said. But she was the one who the public loved. He tells me that since her death in 1964, he visits her once a month at Forest Lawn Cemetery so he can tell her what\u0027s been going on in his life. But at first, his need to see her was so great that he\u0027d go every day.","Tonight he shows me the ring.","That\u0027s a wonderful thing to do.","But I mean, did it take you a long time to get your life back together?","So, how long did it take you to get back to work?","But at that time, you were financially solvent. I mean, you had plenty of money. Wasn\u0027t it more just to take your mind off of things?","But you enjoy it.","OK, so at that time was it more to-- what are you going to do? Just sit around.","One night, years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in west Los Angeles when I saw George come in. He was with a couple of men and a youngish woman. And they all hovered around him. He had aged so much. He moved slowly and was so tiny that he seemed to be lost inside of the dark suit he was wearing. They all slipped into a red booth and ordered dinner. I think the waiter brought George a martini.","When it was time to go, I walked right by him, but I didn\u0027t say hello. To George I was always a blip, just another friendly face on the road."],"spokenWords":["I have this realization. This will be a man who I will get to know in the moments between words. Even on a road trip designed to avoid surprises, I find myself surprised by these men. My view of them comes to change as we spend more time together.","11:00 AM. Reno, Nevada, Bally\u0027s hotel. I\u0027m trying to keep my focus, but I\u0027m tired. Tired of the empty hours, tired of waiting for Irving to call. Whenever I call my boyfriend, his answering machine picks up.

To save me from financial ruin, he asks me to take a walk with him.","Right now Morty\u0027s here. The sun is set and it\u0027s early evening. In general, they have three main topics of conversation, the act, the schedule, and where they want to eat. Here\u0027s some typical dialogue. Morty will say, \"Where should we eat?\" And Irving will say, \"The Broiler Room.\" That\u0027s the hotel steakhouse. And then George will say, \"John will know.\" John\u0027s the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove us to the hotel. And then Irving will say, \"I think we should do the Broiler Room.\" And then George will say, \"John will know. Ask John.\" And then Irving will say, \"I\u0027m making a reservation at the Broiler Room.\" But not moved towards the telephone. And on and on and on. It\u0027s like dialogue that David Mamet would write if David Mamet wrote scenes where absolutely nothing was at stake.","We head down to the Broiler Room. All through dinner there\u0027s this constant traffic of fans, including at one point four cheerleaders. They\u0027re wearing short skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the room. \"Go, George, Go!\" they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattle their crepe paper pom poms. Then, floor show over, they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine.","That\u0027s true.","The pace is very slow. I wake up in the morning, drink coffee, wait for Irving\u0027s call. Mostly I have free time. I lay on a variety of queen-sized beds in a variety of shag carpet hotel rooms and stare up at the ceiling.","While we\u0027re on the road I probably see him do his act five times. Each time it sounds totally spontaneous, like he\u0027s making it up right there, just riffing for the crowd, even though, give or take a gag or two, it\u0027s the exact same act he\u0027s been doing for 15 years.","Tonight he shows me the ring.","Is that like, I don\u0027t know, young--","Most of the time Irving does the talking. He tells me about his past. It\u0027s a history of 20th century show business, big jobs at CBS radio, in the movie studios. Jack Benny hired him to be the president of his production company. It\u0027s a long story. Every once in awhile, though, Irving asks me personal questions about my family, about my friends, about my boyfriend. And then we head back to the hotel.","What\u0027s amazing about all this is that on the surface the act doesn\u0027t seem to vary from city to city. But to George it\u0027s an eternal work in progress. Every night he makes microscopic changes. Maybe he\u0027ll decide to sing \"Young at Heart\" before \"Old Bones.\" When he does this, he gets all worked up about it, thinks about it all day long. But this is how he\u0027s been able to be on the road for so long. This is how he keeps the act feeling fresh for himself.","A rash.","But at that time, you were financially solvent. I mean, you had plenty of money. Wasn\u0027t it more just to take your mind off of things?","There are two ways you feel when you interview a celebrity. There are those that make you feel like a person. Then there are the kind who make you feel like a blip. There\u0027s nothing wrong with a blip interview. In fact, it\u0027s liberating. You can say whatever you want to them. They will not remember you.","Irving takes my hand and loops it past his bent elbow. Arm in arm, we stroll past places with names like The Mapes Hotel and the Liberty Bell Saloon. The way Irving is almost bouncing down the street lets me know he\u0027s enjoying that we come off like a mismatched couple, that I\u0027m his babe and he is my silver-haired, energetic sugar daddy.","It\u0027s OK. I already had breakfast.","Sometimes he\u0027ll change a punchline. He has a gag in his act about people having to retire when they\u0027re 70. He says, \"When I was 70, I had pimples.\" But one day George tries out a new line on me. He says, \"When I was 70, I had cupid\u0027s eczema.\" I think that sounds sort of dirty, but I\u0027m not going to be the one to tell him. In fact, I have tape of this, of myself lying to the nicest man on earth.","When he goes on the road, he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning. When he agrees to a booking it\u0027s stipulated in his contract that he\u0027ll be provided with a backless stool to sit on, a lightly rehearsed orchestra, an ashtray to flick his ashes in, and a pre-show speed ball made up of a couple of martinis chased by a cup of black coffee. He will only smoke El Productos. In the afternoon he likes to take a two hour nap. He hates fresh fruit and vegetables.","One night, years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in west Los Angeles when I saw George come in. He was with a couple of men and a youngish woman.

But George Burns likes these intrusions. He\u0027s nourished by them. When it\u0027s finally quite he says to me, \"Aren\u0027t people nice?\"","In the pocket of these pants is a watch chain. On the watch chain is Gracie\u0027s tiny gold wedding ring. The way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one true talent when he met Gracie Allen.

The road trip I\u0027m on is about making sure that everything is the same. This is the secret to George Burns\u0027 longevity, of how he\u0027s been able to stay on the road for so long without going crazy. He wakes up at a certain time. He goes to sleep at a certain time.","That\u0027s a wonderful thing to do.","Is it?","Nah. I\u0027m just going to--","9 o\u0027clock Friday night, Moscow, Idaho. University Inn. We sit around in the common living room that connects George and Irving\u0027s bedrooms. George and Irving always get connected bedrooms, with a living room in between if they can. In the late afternoon when it\u0027s quiet, this is where George and Irving like to sit. They watch television. They read the trades.","But I mean, did it take you a long time to get your life back together?","So, how long did it take you to get back to work?","As the gin and vermouth kick in, his conversation tends to get naughty. One night he recites to me a particularly memorable limerick that involves a mouse, the phrase \"hickory dickory dock\" and a reference to his own private parts. Morty and Irving laugh, but I don\u0027t know what to do. If I laugh too hard, I\u0027m scared they\u0027re going to think I\u0027m some sort of slut girl. And if I don\u0027t, then I\u0027m a pill, no fun at all. I feel as if I\u0027m in another country with different customs and mores, and so I simply try every possible reaction one after the other, laughing, groaning, shaking my head, waiting for something that works.","No.","When it was time to go, I walked right by him, but I didn\u0027t say hello. To George I was always a blip, just another friendly face on the road.","One day Irving calls to invite me to talk to George as he eats breakfast.","George and Irving can go on like this for hours. They go back and forth and back and forth. And that night, George tries out the cupid\u0027s eczema line. It doesn\u0027t get laughs. On the way home in the car we\u0027re silent. George and a driver in the front. Me in the back, squeezed hip to elbow between Irving and Morty. Suddenly, George\u0027s rumbling voice cuts through the darkness. \"I\u0027ll never do that again,\" he says. It\u0027s quiet for a while more. \"Morty,\" he says, \"tomorrow night let\u0027s--\" and then the conversation starts all over again.","Normally when I think of going on the road, I think of waking up at any hour, of not having to be anywhere at a certain time. You\u0027re on a big adventure. The rules no longer apply. There\u0027s no accountability. But that\u0027s a civilian\u0027s road trip. I am on a very different kind of road trip.","But you enjoy it.","And when we get to my room, he drops me off with this thought. He says, \"Leave your boyfriend. He\u0027s no good.

His stiff grey toupee is somewhere in the other room. It\u0027s startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair, the stacked heeled shoes, the crisp tuxedo. He looks vulnerable, bird like.","Because I\u0027m a reporter, I\u0027m a blip. But the public gets his full attention. He establishes eye contact with each approaching fan and he smiles at them and he asks how they\u0027re doing. And when he leaves the Broiler Room, he\u0027ll choose the most complicated route, slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room, touching people on the shoulder lightly, and saying things like, \"Don\u0027t pay the check.\"","By the end of our time together, I could order for him in a restaurant if necessary. He likes bay shrimp cocktails. He likes roast chicken. He likes his martinis, but doesn\u0027t care what brand of liquor they\u0027re made with. He just wants them to come one after the other. He is 92 and no one can tell him what is good or bad for him to put in his own mouth. Same goes for what comes out of it.","Yes, I did.","OK, so at that time was it more to-- what are you going to do? Just sit around.","Oh. No it doesn\u0027t sound dirty.","All I could come up with was how transparent I must have seemed to these men. Transparent like teenagers are to me.

So the last thing I want to see is a chess table.","Bonifacio, it\u0027s the southernmost city.","And we\u0027re kind of feeling good, but we\u0027re just reading the vibe and we\u0027re like, OK, we shouldn\u0027t say anything.","Yeah, but that was like a malaise.","You didn\u0027t go camping with me. You went to Paris first. And you said you were going to come here earlier. But then you were here too long in my house and you used the washing machine. Like, oh my god, make up your mind. If you\u0027re upset at me, just pick something. I was so confused. And then it dawned on me kind of, you know, this is not the friendship I thought it was. And I\u0027m like, well, you know what? I\u0027m not going to deal with this. I\u0027m out of here. She was like, fine, get out of my house right now. So I go get Candido, in the back yard studying chess.","So we\u0027re in this great romantic city, city of love, and we\u0027re supposed to be, you know, trying to reconnect and cure our malaise and he spent all his time in Paris playing chess and I spent my time--","I fell in love again. It was really beautiful.","Modena.","OK. All right. So the next stage of this whole trip is to go to Corsica. And we had made plans, so we all go. So my friend is mad. They\u0027re fighting and we\u0027re fighting. And we wind up in Corsica.","That\u0027s not true. Don\u0027t exaggerate.","And leaves us with our bags, walking down this road.","She starts arguing. She just rehashes the whole argument all over again and how we couldn\u0027t make it on our own to the train station.","--malaise. So the next thing we know, we\u0027re in Paris. And it\u0027s better than I ever thought it could be. The light was amazing, and the architecture\u0027s amazing.","It\u0027s built into the rock, but it looks like Monaco. It has those kind of lights. It\u0027s very romantic. And our friend drops us off in our hotel and she goes, \"Well, I\u0027ll see you next week.\" And she just drives off.","Thank you very much.","Because they were pretty nice.","On liquor made out of chestnuts, and they were very nice to us. But he\u0027s complaining again, there\u0027s no chess. Everything\u0027s old, it looks like a tomb. I\u0027m upset, there\u0027s no chess players here. I want to leave.","She\u0027s like, get out of here, I never want to see you again.","All right, that\u0027s kind of true. OK. So I\u0027m really psyched and I\u0027m thinking, OK, maybe if we go to Paris we can work on our, you know--","And we had just done it before--","But, you know, we\u0027re happy so I don\u0027t feel like a chess widow anymore, so it\u0027s OK. So I go tell him we have to leave.","So we start fighting more and more. My friend asks me if I support her decision about this wedding. I tell her, no. I mean, you know, you\u0027re 35 years old, you should tell your parents you\u0027re married. And so she\u0027s mad at me. So she stops talking to me. Him and I have one of the hugest fights, and we break up. And he says, \"You know what?\"","Throw us out.","OK. So we\u0027re in this malaise. We haven\u0027t decided yet. And we get a phone call from Paris, from a friend of ours, [? Malika ?], who invites us to stay in her house in Paris. And we tell her about the wedding in Italy and she goes, well, why don\u0027t you come stay with me and then we\u0027ll all go together to Italy? So I think that\u0027s a great idea. We can kind of be with friends in Europe--","That\u0027s true. So she says, if you don\u0027t let me speak, I\u0027m going to throw you out of the car.","The art, the food. It was wonderful.","Her mother doesn\u0027t know anything.","So I tell him, \"Look, Candido, look at the puppet show over there. Isn\u0027t that really great? All these little kids. Look, tennis courts. Wow, there\u0027s so many things to do in the park--\"","Then it\u0027s time to go to the wedding."]},"Candido Tirado":{"name":"Candido Tirado","episodes":{"102":"Road Trip!"},"statements":["Malaise?

Malika ?], the person that was going to give us the apartment to stay in?","Look, chess tables over here. Let\u0027s go see.","Going to museums, stuff like that. Who cares?","The week passes and we take a train overnight to Paris.","To Modena. Excuse me. But we get to Modena, and her friend, we call her, and she says, yeah, I\u0027ll be there in 25 minutes. Comes to pick us up in three hours. And I saw that as a sign that we shouldn\u0027t be there. We should be in Paris where I could be playing chess.

Over the last eight years I figure I\u0027ve ridden at least 100,000 miles on Greyhound. In total, about four solid months of my life have been spent cooped up in their buses. I would consider it my home away from home, if only I had a home.","What I like most about Greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on the bus. Airline passengers love to complain about the five excruciatingly long hours it takes to fly from coast to coast. But on the bus that same distance takes three full days to cover, which is what I think is about the perfect amount of time for such a trip. And unlike airplane flights, no movies are shown on Greyhound, no headsets handed out, no free magazines available. No waitresses force bags of peanuts on you every five minutes. On the bus, passengers are largely left alone with their thoughts.","I have this theory about people who ride Greyhound. About how, as we sit on the bus for hours and days, waiting to reach our destination, we travel in what I call a transitional state, thinking about where we\u0027re coming from and where we\u0027re going to. I know I do. And from my talking to other people on the bus, I know many others do as well.","For example, this one route I\u0027ve ridden a lot goes south through Crescent City, California, home of the Pelican Bay maximum security prison. I rode next to this guy who\u0027d been locked away for 14 years and had just gotten out. Across the aisle from me was a teenager with a buzz cut on his way to boot camp. We talked for a while, but mostly we just sat and thought about the different places we were headed.","For a long time I\u0027ve been wanting to tape record the stories I\u0027ve heard on the bus, to document this phenomenon that I\u0027ve been trying to figure out. So I was pretty excited when This American Life offered to send me on a Greyhound trip with a fancy tape recorder and a seven-day Ameripass. For a week, I could wander any Greyhound route I chose and test my theory about the bus.","So I packed up a loaf of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a bunch of bananas and stepped on a Greyhound.","I spent the first 10 hours traveling down the coast of Oregon. I was so eager to talk with the other passengers I stayed awake all night even though everyone else was sleeping. It wasn\u0027t until we stopped for breakfast in Crescent City that I was finally able to strike up a conversation. Steve was about 50 years old, sported a bushy beard and wore an olive green army jacket. A large wooden crucifix dangled from his neck. He said he was an itinerant preacher and that Greyhound was his chapel.","You avoid audiences. Then who are you talking to?","And Greyhound\u0027s conducive for your traveling ministry?","So normally your preaching on the bus would come with you just talking to the person sitting next to you?","Steve\u0027s ministry is not limited to the teachings of Christ but also included a healthy dose of praise for natural medicines, like cannabis and opium. I thought I was agreeing with him when I said that it did seem ridiculous that pharmaceutical companies simply sold nature back to us. But Steve took offense and pulled out a bottle of Anbesol, which he described as 60% grain alcohol plus benzocaine.","What\u0027s it for?","Chug a lug.","So is that numbing your whole mouth now?","Steve continued talking, but it became increasingly difficult to understand what he was saying as his speech slurred. By the end of our 15 minute talk he told me it was the longest conversation he had in the last three and a half years. Then Steve got on the northbound bus bound for Portland and I continued on to San Francisco.","From San Francisco I rode 10 hours to Los Angeles, sitting next to an 11-year-old kid that didn\u0027t want to talk to me. At the Hollywood bus station I saw a bus headed for San Francisco and figured, what the heck? Maybe I\u0027d get lucky on that bus. So I spent the next 10 hours retracing my route back north, sitting beside a guy who slept the whole way.","I had to wonder, where were all the talkers, all those chatty passengers that usually sit next to me and share their stories about where they\u0027re coming from or going to?","In Reno I switched to a bus route I\u0027ve always been curious about, the one that headed south through old mining towns down to Las Vegas. My attempts to find out who rode that particular bus led nowhere. I approached the other half dozen passengers one by one. But no one would talk to me.","On the bus from Las Vegas to Flagstaff, Arizona, I asked the woman sitting next to me if I could record our conversation for the radio. She acted like I was nuts. \"You want to talk to me about Greyhound for the radio? What radio station is that?\" \"Well,\" I explained, \"it\u0027s a show that\u0027s on different stations in different cities.\" \"What station is it on in Los Angeles then?\" she asked. \"Los Angeles, I\u0027m not sure.\" \"You want to record me for the radio, and you don\u0027t even know what station it is? Yeah, right,\" she\u0027s scoffed. \"Give me a break.\"","She alerted the other passengers around us that I was trying to pull something over on her. Soon I was verbally assaulted from all sides, the butt of everyone\u0027s jokes. I put the tape recorder away and stared out the window. My enthusiasm for this trip was rapidly dwindling.","At a rest stop I slinked away from the pack of passengers who were smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing me and stood off by myself. Maybe I\u0027d been wrong. Maybe there wasn\u0027t anything significant on the minds of Greyhound passengers after all. When the smoke break ended, I reluctantly got back on the bus.","On any bus there\u0027s usually some sort of outcast, like the drunk guy who smells like urine or the woman babbling to herself. Then it dawned on me. With these dorky headphones on my head, this foot long microphone in hand, trying to get people to let me interview them about where they\u0027re going, it was me. I was the weirdo on this bus.","Hello? Well, I guess since nobody else will talk to me on this bus and there are only a couple people on this bus and we\u0027ve got about nine more hours to go and it doesn\u0027t look like anybody else will be getting on the bus because we are in the middle of the desert. So I may as well talk to myself.","We are somewhere in the desert. I can see we\u0027re traveling under a clear blue sky. I can see about 30 miles. And a whole lot of dirt, rocks.","Um--","All these years I\u0027ve boasted of being some sort of hardy Greyhound passenger, impervious to all those things that many people complain about. The seemingly never ending rides, the annoying passengers, the claustrophobia. I mean, I sat next to a guy vomiting on himself and it\u0027s no big deal. I sat across the aisle from people having noisy sex and it didn\u0027t bother me. But now, on this trip, Greyhound was starting to get to me.","On the bus to Phoenix, I found myself wedged between the window and a guy who took up way too much of my seat. I tried to sleep for the first time in days but found that I couldn\u0027t. My whole body was sore. I had shooting pains in the back of my thighs. My back ached. I had a headache. The baby in front of me cried the whole way. The toddler behind me got smacked around for not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy. I was becoming increasingly claustrophobic. I was beginning to lose it.","Normally I survive long bus rides by concentrating on my destination, but now I didn\u0027t have a destination. I wasn\u0027t really going anywhere. How could I expect to find anyone in the transitional state when I wasn\u0027t even in transition myself? Maybe this was the problem with the whole mission. I had ceased being a regular Greyhound passenger. I was an outsider.","I stood in line for the bus to Las Cruces, New Mexico, trying to calm down. I thought I was in control until I watched a mother drag her kicking and crying toddler across the bus station by the kid\u0027s hair. I snapped. I couldn\u0027t take it. I couldn\u0027t handle being constantly surrounded by so many people anymore. I sure wasn\u0027t feeling at home like I usually do.","I stepped out of line for the Las Cruces bus. I had to get home. Sadly, Portland was still a 36-hour ride away.","At the Arizona-California border, a new passenger sat down across the aisle from me. Not needing any more abuse from strangers, I resisted my initial temptation to talk with her. A couple miles down the road I watched her pull a Polaroid photo from her purse, stare at it for a half minute, and then tuck it back in her purse. A minute later she had the photo out again and this time I snuck a peek and saw that it was a photo of her sitting in the lap of a guy wearing prison garb. Since she had boarded the bus in a prison town, I realized she had probably just visited a jailed boyfriend or husband.","Now she had to sit on the bus for who knows how many hours and dwell upon the person she had just left. At last, I thought, the one person I had been looking for on this whole trip. Someone in transition. Someone who could help me prove my theory about the bus. Her name was Lisa. And she was just as suspicious of me as any other passenger had been. But she did consent to let our conversation be recorded.","[INAUDIBLE]","The conversation didn\u0027t get very far. She gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions. Eventually she ended up asking me the majority of the questions. After a couple of awkward minutes, I put the microphone and tape recorder away. She stared at her photograph some more while I watched the desert in the fading sunlight.","A half hour later, after the bus had darkened and people dozed off, Lisa tapped me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandmother. Powers with which she could grant me any wish I desired. For this service she would only charge me $5.00. \"At my shop,\" she said, \"usually I charge $10, uh, $20 for a wish.\" She said it just like that. \"$10, uh, $20.\"","Well, $5 for a wish seemed like a bargain so I started counting up the hundreds of nickles I had won in a Las Vegas slot machine. But she said it would only work with a $5 bill. I didn\u0027t have any fives, but I did have a 10. \"A 10 will work,\" she said.","I followed her instructions, folding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her. She squeezed it in her fist and said, \"Now make a wish. But you can\u0027t tell anyone what it is.\" So I made a wish. Then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes. That these wishes were important, too, but not as important as the super important first wish. Well, in my state I only had one wish that I needed fulfilling, so I just made stuff up for the merely important second and third wishes, wishing for better health and a new romance.","On the dark bus she whispered across the aisle, assuring me that I was now in better health and that I could expect a new love in my life. Then she asked me to tell her my super important wish, my number one wish. \"But you told me not to tell me anyone,\" I said. \"You can tell me,\" she said, \"but don\u0027t tell anyone else.\"","So I told her I wished I wasn\u0027t riding the bus anymore. \"Oh,\" she said. \"You\u0027re tired of riding the bus. I can see it in your face that you\u0027re very tired. You have a kind face.\" She whispered about my face and described how tired I looked for five minutes, mentioning three times that while I might be laughing on the outside I was really crying on the inside.

What radio station is that?\" \"Well,\" I explained, \"it\u0027s a show that\u0027s on different stations in different cities.\" \"What station is it on in Los Angeles then?\" she asked. \"Los Angeles, I\u0027m not sure.\" \"You want to record me for the radio, and you don\u0027t even know what station it is? Yeah, right,\" she\u0027s scoffed. \"Give me a break.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"She alerted the other passengers around us that I was trying to pull something over on her. Soon I was verbally assaulted from all sides, the butt of everyone\u0027s jokes. I put the tape recorder away and stared out the window. My enthusiasm for this trip was rapidly dwindling."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"At a rest stop I slinked away from the pack of passengers who were smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing me and stood off by myself. Maybe I\u0027d been wrong. Maybe there wasn\u0027t anything significant on the minds of Greyhound passengers after all. When the smoke break ended, I reluctantly got back on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On any bus there\u0027s usually some sort of outcast, like the drunk guy who smells like urine or the woman babbling to herself. Then it dawned on me. With these dorky headphones on my head, this foot long microphone in hand, trying to get people to let me interview them about where they\u0027re going, it was me. I was the weirdo on this bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Hello? Well, I guess since nobody else will talk to me on this bus and there are only a couple people on this bus and we\u0027ve got about nine more hours to go and it doesn\u0027t look like anybody else will be getting on the bus because we are in the middle of the desert. So I may as well talk to myself."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"We are somewhere in the desert. I can see we\u0027re traveling under a clear blue sky. I can see about 30 miles. And a whole lot of dirt, rocks."},{"text":"I guess I didn\u0027t have much more to say than anybody else on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Um--"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"All these years I\u0027ve boasted of being some sort of hardy Greyhound passenger, impervious to all those things that many people complain about. The seemingly never ending rides, the annoying passengers, the claustrophobia. I mean, I sat next to a guy vomiting on himself and it\u0027s no big deal. I sat across the aisle from people having noisy sex and it didn\u0027t bother me. But now, on this trip, Greyhound was starting to get to me."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On the bus to Phoenix, I found myself wedged between the window and a guy who took up way too much of my seat. I tried to sleep for the first time in days but found that I couldn\u0027t. My whole body was sore. I had shooting pains in the back of my thighs. My back ached. I had a headache. The baby in front of me cried the whole way. The toddler behind me got smacked around for not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy. I was becoming increasingly claustrophobic. I was beginning to lose it."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Normally I survive long bus rides by concentrating on my destination, but now I didn\u0027t have a destination. I wasn\u0027t really going anywhere. How could I expect to find anyone in the transitional state when I wasn\u0027t even in transition myself? Maybe this was the problem with the whole mission. I had ceased being a regular Greyhound passenger. I was an outsider."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I stood in line for the bus to Las Cruces, New Mexico, trying to calm down. I thought I was in control until I watched a mother drag her kicking and crying toddler across the bus station by the kid\u0027s hair. I snapped. I couldn\u0027t take it. I couldn\u0027t handle being constantly surrounded by so many people anymore. I sure wasn\u0027t feeling at home like I usually do."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I stepped out of line for the Las Cruces bus. I had to get home. Sadly, Portland was still a 36-hour ride away."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"At the Arizona-California border, a new passenger sat down across the aisle from me. Not needing any more abuse from strangers, I resisted my initial temptation to talk with her. A couple miles down the road I watched her pull a Polaroid photo from her purse, stare at it for a half minute, and then tuck it back in her purse. A minute later she had the photo out again and this time I snuck a peek and saw that it was a photo of her sitting in the lap of a guy wearing prison garb. Since she had boarded the bus in a prison town, I realized she had probably just visited a jailed boyfriend or husband."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Now she had to sit on the bus for who knows how many hours and dwell upon the person she had just left. At last, I thought, the one person I had been looking for on this whole trip. Someone in transition. Someone who could help me prove my theory about the bus. Her name was Lisa. And she was just as suspicious of me as any other passenger had been. But she did consent to let our conversation be recorded."},{"speakerName":"Lisa","text":"Arizona. Yeah. Nothing great."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"[INAUDIBLE]"},{"speakerName":"Lisa","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"The conversation didn\u0027t get very far. She gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions. Eventually she ended up asking me the majority of the questions. After a couple of awkward minutes, I put the microphone and tape recorder away. She stared at her photograph some more while I watched the desert in the fading sunlight."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"A half hour later, after the bus had darkened and people dozed off, Lisa tapped me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandmother. Powers with which she could grant me any wish I desired. For this service she would only charge me $5.00. \"At my shop,\" she said, \"usually I charge $10, uh, $20 for a wish.\" She said it just like that. \"$10, uh, $20.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Well, $5 for a wish seemed like a bargain so I started counting up the hundreds of nickles I had won in a Las Vegas slot machine. But she said it would only work with a $5 bill. I didn\u0027t have any fives, but I did have a 10. \"A 10 will work,\" she said."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I followed her instructions, folding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her. She squeezed it in her fist and said, \"Now make a wish. But you can\u0027t tell anyone what it is.\" So I made a wish. Then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes. That these wishes were important, too, but not as important as the super important first wish. Well, in my state I only had one wish that I needed fulfilling, so I just made stuff up for the merely important second and third wishes, wishing for better health and a new romance."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On the dark bus she whispered across the aisle, assuring me that I was now in better health and that I could expect a new love in my life. Then she asked me to tell her my super important wish, my number one wish. \"But you told me not to tell me anyone,\" I said. \"You can tell me,\" she said, \"but don\u0027t tell anyone else.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"So I told her I wished I wasn\u0027t riding the bus anymore. \"Oh,\" she said. \"You\u0027re tired of riding the bus. I can see it in your face that you\u0027re very tired. You have a kind face.\" She whispered about my face and described how tired I looked for five minutes, mentioning three times that while I might be laughing on the outside I was really crying on the inside. But I wasn\u0027t laughing, not even on the outside."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"When she was done I watched her slip my 10 in her pocket. Meanwhile, I was still on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Dishwasher Pete will be putting out a new issue of his zine Dishwasher in a few weeks. Grab a pen.

The night where Gracie died, that night, Bobby Darin said to me, George-- Mr. Burns he always called me-- he says, you don\u0027t want to sleep alone. Why don\u0027t I go home and sleep with you? I says, Bobby I\u0027d love it.","When I was 70 I had cupid\u0027s eczema.","What would you do if somebody died? You sit home and cry? How long can you cry? Cry for two hours? You cry.

You can say whatever you want to them. They will not remember you.","9 o\u0027clock Friday night, Moscow, Idaho. University Inn.

Morty will say, \"Where should we eat?\" And Irving will say, \"The Broiler Room.\" That\u0027s the hotel steakhouse. And then George will say, \"John will know.\" John\u0027s the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove us to the hotel.

Ask John.\" And then Irving will say, \"I\u0027m making a reservation at the Broiler Room.\" But not moved towards the telephone. And on and on and on. It\u0027s like dialogue that David Mamet would write if David Mamet wrote scenes where absolutely nothing was at stake.","We head down to the Broiler Room. All through dinner there\u0027s this constant traffic of fans, including at one point four cheerleaders. They\u0027re wearing short skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the room. \"Go, George, Go!\" they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattle their crepe paper pom poms. Then, floor show over, they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine.","Then in comes the chef to ask for George\u0027s autograph.

Each time it sounds totally spontaneous, like he\u0027s making it up right there, just riffing for the crowd, even though, give or take a gag or two, it\u0027s the exact same act he\u0027s been doing for 15 years.","What\u0027s amazing about all this is that on the surface the act doesn\u0027t seem to vary from city to city. But to George it\u0027s an eternal work in progress. Every night he makes microscopic changes. Maybe he\u0027ll decide to sing \"Young at Heart\" before \"Old Bones.\" When he does this, he gets all worked up about it, thinks about it all day long. But this is how he\u0027s been able to be on the road for so long. This is how he keeps the act feeling fresh for himself.","Sometimes he\u0027ll change a punchline. He has a gag in his act about people having to retire when they\u0027re 70. He says, \"When I was 70, I had pimples.\" But one day George tries out a new line on me. He says, \"When I was 70, I had cupid\u0027s eczema.\" I think that sounds sort of dirty, but I\u0027m not going to be the one to tell him.

Me in the back, squeezed hip to elbow between Irving and Morty. Suddenly, George\u0027s rumbling voice cuts through the darkness. \"I\u0027ll never do that again,\" he says. It\u0027s quiet for a while more. \"Morty,\" he says, \"tomorrow night let\u0027s--\" and then the conversation starts all over again.","Normally when I think of going on the road, I think of waking up at any hour, of not having to be anywhere at a certain time. You\u0027re on a big adventure. The rules no longer apply. There\u0027s no accountability. But that\u0027s a civilian\u0027s road trip.

He goes to sleep at a certain time.","When he goes on the road, he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning. When he agrees to a booking it\u0027s stipulated in his contract that he\u0027ll be provided with a backless stool to sit on, a lightly rehearsed orchestra, an ashtray to flick his ashes in, and a pre-show speed ball made up of a couple of martinis chased by a cup of black coffee. He will only smoke El Productos. In the afternoon he likes to take a two hour nap. He hates fresh fruit and vegetables.","By the end of our time together, I could order for him in a restaurant if necessary. He likes bay shrimp cocktails. He likes roast chicken. He likes his martinis, but doesn\u0027t care what brand of liquor they\u0027re made with. He just wants them to come one after the other. He is 92 and no one can tell him what is good or bad for him to put in his own mouth. Same goes for what comes out of it.","As the gin and vermouth kick in, his conversation tends to get naughty. One night he recites to me a particularly memorable limerick that involves a mouse, the phrase \"hickory dickory dock\" and a reference to his own private parts. Morty and Irving laugh, but I don\u0027t know what to do. If I laugh too hard, I\u0027m scared they\u0027re going to think I\u0027m some sort of slut girl. And if I don\u0027t, then I\u0027m a pill, no fun at all. I feel as if I\u0027m in another country with different customs and mores, and so I simply try every possible reaction one after the other, laughing, groaning, shaking my head, waiting for something that works.","The pace is very slow. I wake up in the morning, drink coffee, wait for Irving\u0027s call. Mostly I have free time. I lay on a variety of queen-sized beds in a variety of shag carpet hotel rooms and stare up at the ceiling.","One day Irving calls to invite me to talk to George as he eats breakfast.","Nah. I\u0027m just going to--","It\u0027s OK. I already had breakfast.","Yes, I did.","George is wearing a thick beige terry cloth bathrobe, beige pajamas, and slippers. His stiff grey toupee is somewhere in the other room. It\u0027s startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair, the stacked heeled shoes, the crisp tuxedo. He looks vulnerable, bird like.","I have this realization. This will be a man who I will get to know in the moments between words. Even on a road trip designed to avoid surprises, I find myself surprised by these men. My view of them comes to change as we spend more time together.","11:00 AM. Reno, Nevada, Bally\u0027s hotel. I\u0027m trying to keep my focus, but I\u0027m tired. Tired of the empty hours, tired of waiting for Irving to call. Whenever I call my boyfriend, his answering machine picks up. Finally I take the elevator to the hotel casino. I play the slot machines, mindlessly pulling down the handle. Somehow Irving finds me. I\u0027m playing the quarter slots. I\u0027m risking a grand total of $10, but he\u0027s positive that I will return home having handed over the title to my car. He goes away, then comes back and tells me it\u0027s time to quit. He goes away, then comes back 15 minutes later and tells me again. I\u0027m annoyed at his nagging, and touched. To save me from financial ruin, he asks me to take a walk with him.","Irving takes my hand and loops it past his bent elbow. Arm in arm, we stroll past places with names like The Mapes Hotel and the Liberty Bell Saloon. The way Irving is almost bouncing down the street lets me know he\u0027s enjoying that we come off like a mismatched couple, that I\u0027m his babe and he is my silver-haired, energetic sugar daddy.","Most of the time Irving does the talking. He tells me about his past. It\u0027s a history of 20th century show business, big jobs at CBS radio, in the movie studios. Jack Benny hired him to be the president of his production company. It\u0027s a long story. Every once in awhile, though, Irving asks me personal questions about my family, about my friends, about my boyfriend. And then we head back to the hotel.","And when we get to my room, he drops me off with this thought. He says, \"Leave your boyfriend. He\u0027s no good. Find someone else.\" And he walks away, and I stand there feeling conflicted. I think, I\u0027m no longer a blip to Irving, but who does he think he is? He doesn\u0027t know me. He\u0027s never met my boyfriend. A couple of years later I foll his advice. And every once in awhile I think back, trying to remember what it was that I said to him, what allowed him to distill this conclusion from my small talk. How come he knew something that took so long for me to figure out?","All I could come up with was how transparent I must have seemed to these men. Transparent like teenagers are to me. I mean, how many different human stories are there? These men had already been there.","Finally, we are on the road for so long that George is treating me like old news, which is where you want to be with George. When Irving lets me into George\u0027s suite before a show, George emerges from his room wearing shiny patent leather loafers, a crisp white shirt, a bow tie, and a knee-length paisley dressing down. He is pantless. He doesn\u0027t want to put on his tuxedo slacks until the very last minute so they don\u0027t lose their knife-sharp crease.","In the pocket of these pants is a watch chain. On the watch chain is Gracie\u0027s tiny gold wedding ring. The way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one true talent when he met Gracie Allen. And he stayed married to her for 38 years. He was the brains of the act, the one who wrote almost every word she said. But she was the one who the public loved. He tells me that since her death in 1964, he visits her once a month at Forest Lawn Cemetery so he can tell her what\u0027s been going on in his life. But at first, his need to see her was so great that he\u0027d go every day.","Tonight he shows me the ring.","That\u0027s a wonderful thing to do.","But I mean, did it take you a long time to get your life back together?","So, how long did it take you to get back to work?","But at that time, you were financially solvent. I mean, you had plenty of money. Wasn\u0027t it more just to take your mind off of things?","But you enjoy it.","OK, so at that time was it more to-- what are you going to do? Just sit around.","One night, years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in west Los Angeles when I saw George come in. He was with a couple of men and a youngish woman. And they all hovered around him. He had aged so much. He moved slowly and was so tiny that he seemed to be lost inside of the dark suit he was wearing. They all slipped into a red booth and ordered dinner. I think the waiter brought George a martini.","When it was time to go, I walked right by him, but I didn\u0027t say hello.

Act Three, On the Road in a Tuxedo."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"There are two ways you feel when you interview a celebrity. There are those that make you feel like a person. Then there are the kind who make you feel like a blip. There\u0027s nothing wrong with a blip interview. In fact, it\u0027s liberating. You can say whatever you want to them. They will not remember you."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"10 years ago reporter Margy Rochlin was sent to do a magazine story about George Burns. For a 92-year-old, he was spending a lot of time on the road. 25 shows a year at conventions and other one night gigs. Plus weeklong stints in Vegas and Atlantic City."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is the story of a road trip as business not pleasure. George\u0027s entourage in its entirety at that time included Irving Fein, his then 77-year-old manager, and Morty Jacobs, his piano player for, at that time, 23 years."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"From the start it was clear to Margy, they were kind men, they were polite men. They called her \"kid\" the way they called everybody \"kid.\" They reminded her a lot of some of her older Jewish relatives. But this was a blip story."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"9 o\u0027clock Friday night, Moscow, Idaho. University Inn. We sit around in the common living room that connects George and Irving\u0027s bedrooms. George and Irving always get connected bedrooms, with a living room in between if they can. In the late afternoon when it\u0027s quiet, this is where George and Irving like to sit. They watch television. They read the trades."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Right now Morty\u0027s here. The sun is set and it\u0027s early evening. In general, they have three main topics of conversation, the act, the schedule, and where they want to eat. Here\u0027s some typical dialogue. Morty will say, \"Where should we eat?\" And Irving will say, \"The Broiler Room.\" That\u0027s the hotel steakhouse. And then George will say, \"John will know.\" John\u0027s the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove us to the hotel. And then Irving will say, \"I think we should do the Broiler Room.\" And then George will say, \"John will know. Ask John.\" And then Irving will say, \"I\u0027m making a reservation at the Broiler Room.\" But not moved towards the telephone. And on and on and on. It\u0027s like dialogue that David Mamet would write if David Mamet wrote scenes where absolutely nothing was at stake."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"We head down to the Broiler Room. All through dinner there\u0027s this constant traffic of fans, including at one point four cheerleaders. They\u0027re wearing short skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the room. \"Go, George, Go!\" they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattle their crepe paper pom poms. Then, floor show over, they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Then in comes the chef to ask for George\u0027s autograph. But George Burns likes these intrusions. He\u0027s nourished by them. When it\u0027s finally quite he says to me, \"Aren\u0027t people nice?\""},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Because I\u0027m a reporter, I\u0027m a blip. But the public gets his full attention. He establishes eye contact with each approaching fan and he smiles at them and he asks how they\u0027re doing. And when he leaves the Broiler Room, he\u0027ll choose the most complicated route, slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room, touching people on the shoulder lightly, and saying things like, \"Don\u0027t pay the check.\""},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"It\u0027s nice to be here. It\u0027s nice to be anywhere."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"While we\u0027re on the road I probably see him do his act five times. Each time it sounds totally spontaneous, like he\u0027s making it up right there, just riffing for the crowd, even though, give or take a gag or two, it\u0027s the exact same act he\u0027s been doing for 15 years."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"And thank you for that standing ovation. But it made me nervous. See, as a rule, an entertainer gets a standing ovation at the end of the show. You were afraid I wouldn\u0027t last that long."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"What\u0027s amazing about all this is that on the surface the act doesn\u0027t seem to vary from city to city. But to George it\u0027s an eternal work in progress. Every night he makes microscopic changes. Maybe he\u0027ll decide to sing \"Young at Heart\" before \"Old Bones.\" When he does this, he gets all worked up about it, thinks about it all day long. But this is how he\u0027s been able to be on the road for so long. This is how he keeps the act feeling fresh for himself."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Sometimes he\u0027ll change a punchline. He has a gag in his act about people having to retire when they\u0027re 70. He says, \"When I was 70, I had pimples.\" But one day George tries out a new line on me. He says, \"When I was 70, I had cupid\u0027s eczema.\" I think that sounds sort of dirty, but I\u0027m not going to be the one to tell him. In fact, I have tape of this, of myself lying to the nicest man on earth."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"What would you think that is, cupid\u0027s eczema?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Is that like, I don\u0027t know, young--"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"It doesn\u0027t sound dirty, does it?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"Good. OK. That\u0027s all."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Is it?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"No. It\u0027s not supposed to be."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Oh. No it doesn\u0027t sound dirty."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"When I was 70 I had cupid\u0027s eczema."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"Well, that is dirty."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"It isn\u0027t dirty. You\u0027re making it dirty. You don\u0027t know what cupid\u0027s eczema is. It could be anything."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"Well, eczema is a--"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"A rash."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"A rash. And cupid is the love. It\u0027s a love rash."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"OK. A love rash. What\u0027s dirty about a love rash?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"That\u0027s true."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"George and Irving can go on like this for hours. They go back and forth and back and forth. And that night, George tries out the cupid\u0027s eczema line. It doesn\u0027t get laughs. On the way home in the car we\u0027re silent. George and a driver in the front. Me in the back, squeezed hip to elbow between Irving and Morty. Suddenly, George\u0027s rumbling voice cuts through the darkness. \"I\u0027ll never do that again,\" he says. It\u0027s quiet for a while more. \"Morty,\" he says, \"tomorrow night let\u0027s--\" and then the conversation starts all over again."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Normally when I think of going on the road, I think of waking up at any hour, of not having to be anywhere at a certain time. You\u0027re on a big adventure. The rules no longer apply. There\u0027s no accountability. But that\u0027s a civilian\u0027s road trip. I am on a very different kind of road trip."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"The road trip I\u0027m on is not about adventure and unpredictability. The road trip I\u0027m on is about making sure that everything is the same. This is the secret to George Burns\u0027 longevity, of how he\u0027s been able to stay on the road for so long without going crazy. He wakes up at a certain time. He goes to sleep at a certain time."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"When he goes on the road, he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning. When he agrees to a booking it\u0027s stipulated in his contract that he\u0027ll be provided with a backless stool to sit on, a lightly rehearsed orchestra, an ashtray to flick his ashes in, and a pre-show speed ball made up of a couple of martinis chased by a cup of black coffee. He will only smoke El Productos. In the afternoon he likes to take a two hour nap. He hates fresh fruit and vegetables."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"By the end of our time together, I could order for him in a restaurant if necessary. He likes bay shrimp cocktails. He likes roast chicken. He likes his martinis, but doesn\u0027t care what brand of liquor they\u0027re made with. He just wants them to come one after the other. He is 92 and no one can tell him what is good or bad for him to put in his own mouth. Same goes for what comes out of it."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"As the gin and vermouth kick in, his conversation tends to get naughty. One night he recites to me a particularly memorable limerick that involves a mouse, the phrase \"hickory dickory dock\" and a reference to his own private parts. Morty and Irving laugh, but I don\u0027t know what to do. If I laugh too hard, I\u0027m scared they\u0027re going to think I\u0027m some sort of slut girl. And if I don\u0027t, then I\u0027m a pill, no fun at all. I feel as if I\u0027m in another country with different customs and mores, and so I simply try every possible reaction one after the other, laughing, groaning, shaking my head, waiting for something that works."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"The pace is very slow. I wake up in the morning, drink coffee, wait for Irving\u0027s call. Mostly I have free time. I lay on a variety of queen-sized beds in a variety of shag carpet hotel rooms and stare up at the ceiling."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"One day Irving calls to invite me to talk to George as he eats breakfast."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"You want something, kid?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Nah. I\u0027m just going to--"},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"I could have ordered something for you."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"It\u0027s OK. I already had breakfast."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"You did, eh?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Yes, I did."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"Did you do your cereal already, George?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"No. I don\u0027t know if I can do the cereal."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"You can do the cereal, George."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"George is wearing a thick beige terry cloth bathrobe, beige pajamas, and slippers. His stiff grey toupee is somewhere in the other room. It\u0027s startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair, the stacked heeled shoes, the crisp tuxedo. He looks vulnerable, bird like."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"I have this realization. This will be a man who I will get to know in the moments between words. Even on a road trip designed to avoid surprises, I find myself surprised by these men. My view of them comes to change as we spend more time together."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"11:00 AM. Reno, Nevada, Bally\u0027s hotel. I\u0027m trying to keep my focus, but I\u0027m tired. Tired of the empty hours, tired of waiting for Irving to call. Whenever I call my boyfriend, his answering machine picks up. Finally I take the elevator to the hotel casino. I play the slot machines, mindlessly pulling down the handle. Somehow Irving finds me. I\u0027m playing the quarter slots. I\u0027m risking a grand total of $10, but he\u0027s positive that I will return home having handed over the title to my car. He goes away, then comes back and tells me it\u0027s time to quit. He goes away, then comes back 15 minutes later and tells me again. I\u0027m annoyed at his nagging, and touched. To save me from financial ruin, he asks me to take a walk with him."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Irving takes my hand and loops it past his bent elbow. Arm in arm, we stroll past places with names like The Mapes Hotel and the Liberty Bell Saloon. The way Irving is almost bouncing down the street lets me know he\u0027s enjoying that we come off like a mismatched couple, that I\u0027m his babe and he is my silver-haired, energetic sugar daddy."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Most of the time Irving does the talking. He tells me about his past. It\u0027s a history of 20th century show business, big jobs at CBS radio, in the movie studios. Jack Benny hired him to be the president of his production company. It\u0027s a long story. Every once in awhile, though, Irving asks me personal questions about my family, about my friends, about my boyfriend. And then we head back to the hotel."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"And when we get to my room, he drops me off with this thought. He says, \"Leave your boyfriend. He\u0027s no good. Find someone else.\" And he walks away, and I stand there feeling conflicted. I think, I\u0027m no longer a blip to Irving, but who does he think he is? He doesn\u0027t know me. He\u0027s never met my boyfriend. A couple of years later I foll his advice. And every once in awhile I think back, trying to remember what it was that I said to him, what allowed him to distill this conclusion from my small talk. How come he knew something that took so long for me to figure out?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"All I could come up with was how transparent I must have seemed to these men. Transparent like teenagers are to me. I mean, how many different human stories are there? These men had already been there."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Finally, we are on the road for so long that George is treating me like old news, which is where you want to be with George. When Irving lets me into George\u0027s suite before a show, George emerges from his room wearing shiny patent leather loafers, a crisp white shirt, a bow tie, and a knee-length paisley dressing down. He is pantless. He doesn\u0027t want to put on his tuxedo slacks until the very last minute so they don\u0027t lose their knife-sharp crease."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"In the pocket of these pants is a watch chain. On the watch chain is Gracie\u0027s tiny gold wedding ring. The way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one true talent when he met Gracie Allen. And he stayed married to her for 38 years. He was the brains of the act, the one who wrote almost every word she said. But she was the one who the public loved. He tells me that since her death in 1964, he visits her once a month at Forest Lawn Cemetery so he can tell her what\u0027s been going on in his life. But at first, his need to see her was so great that he\u0027d go every day."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Tonight he shows me the ring."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"When Gracie died, it was terrible. Terribly dry. Then finally I started sleeping in Gracie\u0027s bed, and that helped a lot. The night where Gracie died, that night, Bobby Darin said to me, George-- Mr. Burns he always called me-- he says, you don\u0027t want to sleep alone. Why don\u0027t I go home and sleep with you? I says, Bobby I\u0027d love it."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"That\u0027s a wonderful thing to do."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"Yeah, he slept with me that night."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"But I mean, did it take you a long time to get your life back together?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"I was shocked when Gracie died. I didn\u0027t think Gracie should die. But you can\u0027t do anything."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"So, how long did it take you to get back to work?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"I started to work right away. That got nothing to with it. Show business has got nothing to do with that. You\u0027re doing your act. You\u0027re making a living. It\u0027s a different kind of--"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"But at that time, you were financially solvent. I mean, you had plenty of money. Wasn\u0027t it more just to take your mind off of things?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"I\u0027ve got plenty of money now and I\u0027m working."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"But you enjoy it."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"That\u0027s right."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"OK, so at that time was it more to-- what are you going to do? Just sit around."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"What would you do if somebody died? You sit home and cry? How long can you cry? Cry for two hours? You cry. And you cry, and you cry. Finally there are no more tears. Now you go to work. And you feel bad. Every time you come home, you feel bad because Gracie isn\u0027t there."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"One night, years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in west Los Angeles when I saw George come in. He was with a couple of men and a youngish woman. And they all hovered around him. He had aged so much. He moved slowly and was so tiny that he seemed to be lost inside of the dark suit he was wearing. They all slipped into a red booth and ordered dinner. I think the waiter brought George a martini."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"When it was time to go, I walked right by him, but I didn\u0027t say hello. To George I was always a blip, just another friendly face on the road."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Margy Rochlin is a magazine writer in Los Angeles."}]},"5":{"actNumber":5,"actName":"Act Four: Paw Paw for Jesus","contributorMap":{"Cheryl Trykv":{"name":"Cheryl Trykv","episodes":{"102":"Road Trip!"},"statements":["It\u0027s 1990 and she\u0027s wearing a 1977 bleached blond Farrah Fawcett feather do and electric blue Maybelline mascara which contrast nicely with the lime green polyester manager\u0027s pantsuit she\u0027s got on. And she\u0027s telling me, no, not for under $50 dollars a night. Not for under $50 a night will she let me leave my car in the parking lot of her Paw Paw, Michigan Speedway convenience store gas station. This, after an hour and a half of my going in and out, buying chips and juice and cigarettes, wondering what I\u0027m going to do with the Ford Lynx I have borrowed from a friend, which has now got a split valve or something and is busted all to hell and I\u0027m in the middle of goddamn nowhere on the other side of Dowagiac on my way to Kalamazoo for a getaway weekend. I wanted to see America.","I ask her why I can\u0027t leave my car in the parking lot. She says it\u0027s the rule. I ask who makes the decisions about that rule. She says she does.

I tell her that I noticed on my way in through her charming little town a sweet and simple church with a banner out front that read \"Bold yet humble. Paw Paw for Jesus.\" There are few customers in the store, so I say it again, louder. Paw Paw for Jesus. Paw Paw for Jesus.","An older gentlemen with an Abraham Lincoln beard and an Elvis Presley coiffe stares at me blankly. The manager tells me to cut the crap and get out of the store.

As I walk away, I accidentally shove my body against a candy bar display case, knocking over hundreds and thousands of Three Musketeers, Reese\u0027s, Special Dark, and Snickers. Sweet Tarts fly and spill. A grand gesture of public nuisance. That\u0027s it, missus, Mary Ann says from behind the counter. Your big city ass is cooked. I\u0027m calling the police. You idiot, I think to myself on my way out the door. Do I look married to you?","I make it to the highway in no time flat, speed walk backwards with my thumb in the air, calling out to passing cars, Paw Paw for Jesus, Paw Paw for Jesus. A few cars honk and wave, but nobody stops.","I can\u0027t imagine it might be what I\u0027m wearing, the same jet black cocktail dress I wore the night before. Maybe my lipstick is too blood red for broad daylight in a small town like Paw Paw. Maybe I just don\u0027t seem like I belong here. Finally a van pulls over. It\u0027s a Chevy van, one with a mural painted on the side depicting what King Arthur and Guinevere might look like in the year 2500.","King Arthur wears a gold mesh nuclear cleanup suit. He carries a sword in one hand and a laser gun in the other. Guinevere is nude and amply buxom. Where her pubic hair might be she holds the Holy Grail. The driver leans over and opens the door.

Cops.","What have I got against cops, he wants to know. Nothing, it\u0027s just that I\u0027m allergic to pork. It occurs to me at this point to shut up.

But it didn\u0027t happen like that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Any road trip is going to feel longer than you think it will. And you\u0027ll be tired and you won\u0027t get a meal exactly when you\u0027re hungry. You never find a bed exactly when you want to go to sleep.

That somewhere, anywhere, is better than here. That somewhere on the road I will turn into the person that I want to be. I\u0027ll turn into the person that I believe I could be, that I am.

What it is like when being on the road has been your job for decades."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Four, Paw Paw for Jesus. Cheryl Trykv achieves what everyone wants when they hit the road. She actually finds adventure, and it is not pretty. Stay with us."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Busman\u0027s Holiday. Regular listeners to our program may remember Dishwasher Pete who travels from state to state washing dishes and publishing his zine Dishwasher. Usually he only stays in one place for a few weeks. And then he takes the Greyhound bus to the next town. Lately he\u0027s been living in Portland. But he was only too happy to get back on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I like riding Greyhound. Over the last eight years I figure I\u0027ve ridden at least 100,000 miles on Greyhound. In total, about four solid months of my life have been spent cooped up in their buses. I would consider it my home away from home, if only I had a home."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"What I like most about Greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on the bus. Airline passengers love to complain about the five excruciatingly long hours it takes to fly from coast to coast. But on the bus that same distance takes three full days to cover, which is what I think is about the perfect amount of time for such a trip. And unlike airplane flights, no movies are shown on Greyhound, no headsets handed out, no free magazines available. No waitresses force bags of peanuts on you every five minutes. On the bus, passengers are largely left alone with their thoughts."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I have this theory about people who ride Greyhound. About how, as we sit on the bus for hours and days, waiting to reach our destination, we travel in what I call a transitional state, thinking about where we\u0027re coming from and where we\u0027re going to. I know I do. And from my talking to other people on the bus, I know many others do as well."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"For example, this one route I\u0027ve ridden a lot goes south through Crescent City, California, home of the Pelican Bay maximum security prison. I rode next to this guy who\u0027d been locked away for 14 years and had just gotten out. Across the aisle from me was a teenager with a buzz cut on his way to boot camp. We talked for a while, but mostly we just sat and thought about the different places we were headed."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"For a long time I\u0027ve been wanting to tape record the stories I\u0027ve heard on the bus, to document this phenomenon that I\u0027ve been trying to figure out. So I was pretty excited when This American Life offered to send me on a Greyhound trip with a fancy tape recorder and a seven-day Ameripass. For a week, I could wander any Greyhound route I chose and test my theory about the bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"So I packed up a loaf of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a bunch of bananas and stepped on a Greyhound."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I spent the first 10 hours traveling down the coast of Oregon. I was so eager to talk with the other passengers I stayed awake all night even though everyone else was sleeping. It wasn\u0027t until we stopped for breakfast in Crescent City that I was finally able to strike up a conversation. Steve was about 50 years old, sported a bushy beard and wore an olive green army jacket. A large wooden crucifix dangled from his neck. He said he was an itinerant preacher and that Greyhound was his chapel."},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Well, I just preach in my own time. Not any specific times. And usually try to avoid audiences when I do speak because that way I reduce the possibilities of rejection or mockery. [LAUGHS]"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"You avoid audiences. Then who are you talking to?"},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Well, see, I believe in the transmission of voice or spirit can transmit 360 degrees into the world times 360 degrees."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"And Greyhound\u0027s conducive for your traveling ministry?"},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Well, in the fact that I do not have my own privacy, like in a private vehicle, there becomes an either intermeshing or clashing of spirits like on a crowded-type Greyhound. Sometimes things are more harmonious, and other times people pick and poke and they solicit a reaction."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"So normally your preaching on the bus would come with you just talking to the person sitting next to you?"},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Most of my preaching is done by myself, just speaking into the air, though, without another human being being there. You might be one of the first human beings that\u0027s ever really listened to me or acknowledged that in my presence."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Steve\u0027s ministry is not limited to the teachings of Christ but also included a healthy dose of praise for natural medicines, like cannabis and opium. I thought I was agreeing with him when I said that it did seem ridiculous that pharmaceutical companies simply sold nature back to us. But Steve took offense and pulled out a bottle of Anbesol, which he described as 60% grain alcohol plus benzocaine."},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Which is a chemical, as a chemical similar to the naturally occurring cocaine. And so if a person likes the cocaine--"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"What\u0027s it for?"},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Well, it\u0027s just a little topical anesthetic which is like a local number. And so they talk about toothache and things of that nature. Certainly not a central nervous system relaxant like the opium poppy. Which I consider more of a valuable plant. Because of its pain relief but--"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Chug a lug."},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Just a little nip. Just a little nip now."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"So is that numbing your whole mouth now?"},{"speakerName":"Steve","text":"Well, it takes about 10, 15 seconds. Actually, there is an immediate effect, but, yes, it is actually, believe it or not, numbing and very pleasant."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Steve continued talking, but it became increasingly difficult to understand what he was saying as his speech slurred. By the end of our 15 minute talk he told me it was the longest conversation he had in the last three and a half years. Then Steve got on the northbound bus bound for Portland and I continued on to San Francisco."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"From San Francisco I rode 10 hours to Los Angeles, sitting next to an 11-year-old kid that didn\u0027t want to talk to me. At the Hollywood bus station I saw a bus headed for San Francisco and figured, what the heck? Maybe I\u0027d get lucky on that bus. So I spent the next 10 hours retracing my route back north, sitting beside a guy who slept the whole way."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I had to wonder, where were all the talkers, all those chatty passengers that usually sit next to me and share their stories about where they\u0027re coming from or going to?"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"In Reno I switched to a bus route I\u0027ve always been curious about, the one that headed south through old mining towns down to Las Vegas. My attempts to find out who rode that particular bus led nowhere. I approached the other half dozen passengers one by one. But no one would talk to me."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On the bus from Las Vegas to Flagstaff, Arizona, I asked the woman sitting next to me if I could record our conversation for the radio. She acted like I was nuts. \"You want to talk to me about Greyhound for the radio? What radio station is that?\" \"Well,\" I explained, \"it\u0027s a show that\u0027s on different stations in different cities.\" \"What station is it on in Los Angeles then?\" she asked. \"Los Angeles, I\u0027m not sure.\" \"You want to record me for the radio, and you don\u0027t even know what station it is? Yeah, right,\" she\u0027s scoffed. \"Give me a break.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"She alerted the other passengers around us that I was trying to pull something over on her. Soon I was verbally assaulted from all sides, the butt of everyone\u0027s jokes. I put the tape recorder away and stared out the window. My enthusiasm for this trip was rapidly dwindling."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"At a rest stop I slinked away from the pack of passengers who were smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing me and stood off by myself. Maybe I\u0027d been wrong. Maybe there wasn\u0027t anything significant on the minds of Greyhound passengers after all. When the smoke break ended, I reluctantly got back on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On any bus there\u0027s usually some sort of outcast, like the drunk guy who smells like urine or the woman babbling to herself. Then it dawned on me. With these dorky headphones on my head, this foot long microphone in hand, trying to get people to let me interview them about where they\u0027re going, it was me. I was the weirdo on this bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Hello? Well, I guess since nobody else will talk to me on this bus and there are only a couple people on this bus and we\u0027ve got about nine more hours to go and it doesn\u0027t look like anybody else will be getting on the bus because we are in the middle of the desert. So I may as well talk to myself."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"We are somewhere in the desert. I can see we\u0027re traveling under a clear blue sky. I can see about 30 miles. And a whole lot of dirt, rocks."},{"text":"I guess I didn\u0027t have much more to say than anybody else on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Um--"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"All these years I\u0027ve boasted of being some sort of hardy Greyhound passenger, impervious to all those things that many people complain about. The seemingly never ending rides, the annoying passengers, the claustrophobia. I mean, I sat next to a guy vomiting on himself and it\u0027s no big deal. I sat across the aisle from people having noisy sex and it didn\u0027t bother me. But now, on this trip, Greyhound was starting to get to me."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On the bus to Phoenix, I found myself wedged between the window and a guy who took up way too much of my seat. I tried to sleep for the first time in days but found that I couldn\u0027t. My whole body was sore. I had shooting pains in the back of my thighs. My back ached. I had a headache. The baby in front of me cried the whole way. The toddler behind me got smacked around for not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy. I was becoming increasingly claustrophobic. I was beginning to lose it."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Normally I survive long bus rides by concentrating on my destination, but now I didn\u0027t have a destination. I wasn\u0027t really going anywhere. How could I expect to find anyone in the transitional state when I wasn\u0027t even in transition myself? Maybe this was the problem with the whole mission. I had ceased being a regular Greyhound passenger. I was an outsider."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I stood in line for the bus to Las Cruces, New Mexico, trying to calm down. I thought I was in control until I watched a mother drag her kicking and crying toddler across the bus station by the kid\u0027s hair. I snapped. I couldn\u0027t take it. I couldn\u0027t handle being constantly surrounded by so many people anymore. I sure wasn\u0027t feeling at home like I usually do."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I stepped out of line for the Las Cruces bus. I had to get home. Sadly, Portland was still a 36-hour ride away."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"At the Arizona-California border, a new passenger sat down across the aisle from me. Not needing any more abuse from strangers, I resisted my initial temptation to talk with her. A couple miles down the road I watched her pull a Polaroid photo from her purse, stare at it for a half minute, and then tuck it back in her purse. A minute later she had the photo out again and this time I snuck a peek and saw that it was a photo of her sitting in the lap of a guy wearing prison garb. Since she had boarded the bus in a prison town, I realized she had probably just visited a jailed boyfriend or husband."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Now she had to sit on the bus for who knows how many hours and dwell upon the person she had just left. At last, I thought, the one person I had been looking for on this whole trip. Someone in transition. Someone who could help me prove my theory about the bus. Her name was Lisa. And she was just as suspicious of me as any other passenger had been. But she did consent to let our conversation be recorded."},{"speakerName":"Lisa","text":"Arizona. Yeah. Nothing great."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"[INAUDIBLE]"},{"speakerName":"Lisa","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"The conversation didn\u0027t get very far. She gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions. Eventually she ended up asking me the majority of the questions. After a couple of awkward minutes, I put the microphone and tape recorder away. She stared at her photograph some more while I watched the desert in the fading sunlight."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"A half hour later, after the bus had darkened and people dozed off, Lisa tapped me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandmother. Powers with which she could grant me any wish I desired. For this service she would only charge me $5.00. \"At my shop,\" she said, \"usually I charge $10, uh, $20 for a wish.\" She said it just like that. \"$10, uh, $20.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Well, $5 for a wish seemed like a bargain so I started counting up the hundreds of nickles I had won in a Las Vegas slot machine. But she said it would only work with a $5 bill. I didn\u0027t have any fives, but I did have a 10. \"A 10 will work,\" she said."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I followed her instructions, folding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her. She squeezed it in her fist and said, \"Now make a wish. But you can\u0027t tell anyone what it is.\" So I made a wish. Then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes. That these wishes were important, too, but not as important as the super important first wish. Well, in my state I only had one wish that I needed fulfilling, so I just made stuff up for the merely important second and third wishes, wishing for better health and a new romance."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"On the dark bus she whispered across the aisle, assuring me that I was now in better health and that I could expect a new love in my life. Then she asked me to tell her my super important wish, my number one wish. \"But you told me not to tell me anyone,\" I said. \"You can tell me,\" she said, \"but don\u0027t tell anyone else.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"So I told her I wished I wasn\u0027t riding the bus anymore. \"Oh,\" she said. \"You\u0027re tired of riding the bus. I can see it in your face that you\u0027re very tired. You have a kind face.\" She whispered about my face and described how tired I looked for five minutes, mentioning three times that while I might be laughing on the outside I was really crying on the inside. But I wasn\u0027t laughing, not even on the outside."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"When she was done I watched her slip my 10 in her pocket. Meanwhile, I was still on the bus."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Dishwasher Pete will be putting out a new issue of his zine Dishwasher in a few weeks. Grab a pen.

A road trip can be a profound test of any relationship. After all, expectations are high, everybody\u0027s looking for a good time. And at the same time you\u0027re in circumstances that can make anybody irritable, probably because you\u0027re together all the time. All the time. Because of all this, a road trip can save a marriage or destroy it.

Whatever."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"OK. So we\u0027re in this malaise. We haven\u0027t decided yet. And we get a phone call from Paris, from a friend of ours, [? Malika ?], who invites us to stay in her house in Paris. And we tell her about the wedding in Italy and she goes, well, why don\u0027t you come stay with me and then we\u0027ll all go together to Italy? So I think that\u0027s a great idea. We can kind of be with friends in Europe--"},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"I need to interrupt here. When she says Paris, see, you don\u0027t get the idea. This is an obsession. Ever since I know her, she says, I want to go to Paris, I want to go Paris."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"That\u0027s not true. Don\u0027t exaggerate."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"Every movie that has Paris in the backdrop, we see.

And we call her apartment, and they say the number\u0027s disconnected. So we get a hotel room on the Left Bank. And I\u0027m just really overly excited. And one day on our way to the Eiffel Tower, we go through the Jardin du Luxembourg, which is a beautiful park. And out of the corner of my eye, I see chess tables. And like we said before, he\u0027s a chess master. He\u0027s a national master. He\u0027s in the top 1% of the United States. So the last thing I want to see is a chess table."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"So I tell him, \"Look, Candido, look at the puppet show over there. Isn\u0027t that really great? All these little kids. Look, tennis courts. Wow, there\u0027s so many things to do in the park--\""},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"Look, chess tables over here.

And Carmen didn\u0027t want to go back."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"Because I knew that as soon as we got back to Paris, he would play chess. I was like, no way. I want a vacation. We\u0027re going to be here in Italy. We\u0027re going to support my friend. I don\u0027t want to hear the word chess."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"So her friend lives like-- we thought she lived in the city but she really lives like in Arkansas. Cow country.

We start fighting more and more."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"So we start fighting more and more. My friend asks me if I support her decision about this wedding. I tell her, no. I mean, you know, you\u0027re 35 years old, you should tell your parents you\u0027re married. And so she\u0027s mad at me. So she stops talking to me. Him and I have one of the hugest fights, and we break up.

I\u0027m like, go, but I have all the passports. I take care of the tickets. I\u0027m the one that made all the phone calls in French and Italian. So I tell him, OK, if you can figure out on your own how to get back to Paris, you can go. So he couldn\u0027t figure out how to get back, so he stayed with me."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"I knew how to go back. I just didn\u0027t know how to speak the language to get back, you know."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"OK. All right. So the next stage of this whole trip is to go to Corsica.

It\u0027s these ugly rocks coming out from the ground. And so I\u0027m not really happy here. And I\u0027m feeling more and more claustrophobic because now I\u0027m in another country.

So they get very angry at us, of course. You know, that\u0027s another thing to be angry about.

He\u0027s like, you know, this really sucks. I can\u0027t believe that you did this to me. I could have been in Paris. But then we start taking walks. I mean, there\u0027s really not much else to do and, so--"},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"One morning."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"There\u0027s a beautiful prehistoric town, and we start kind of connecting and talking about the history. One morning we\u0027re eating breakfast in a beautiful restaurant that\u0027s built into the rock. And it\u0027s a very clear day. And we\u0027re on the patio. And you can see Sardinia. And it dawned on me, wow, we\u0027re two Puerto Ricans from the Bronx and we\u0027re here and we see Sardinia and this beautiful day. And I look over to Candido and I\u0027m like, wow, I\u0027m really glad I\u0027m sharing this with him."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"I was feeling the same way."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"So Sunday morning was the seventh day. She calls and she says, OK, be downstairs in 20 minutes. We go downstairs, 20 minutes, she comes and we get back in the car. And it took 12 hours to get back to Formigine. Because there\u0027s a long ride, there\u0027s a ferry, and then there\u0027s another long ride in Italy. And in those 12 hours nobody said a word. And she was really upset."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"And we\u0027re kind of feeling good, but we\u0027re just reading the vibe and we\u0027re like, OK, we shouldn\u0027t say anything."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"The next morning we pack. And we\u0027re supposed to be leaving about 4:00 to catch the 5 o\u0027clock train. And somewhere about 12 o\u0027clock she calls Carmen over."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"She wants to talk to me privately. And she brings me into this office in her-- she has a really big house. And she says, I\u0027m really mad at you because you didn\u0027t talk to me on the way back from Corsica. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s up with you."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"You didn\u0027t go camping."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"You didn\u0027t go camping with me. You went to Paris first. And you said you were going to come here earlier. But then you were here too long in my house and you used the washing machine. Like, oh my god, make up your mind. If you\u0027re upset at me, just pick something. I was so confused. And then it dawned on me kind of, you know, this is not the friendship I thought it was. And I\u0027m like, well, you know what? I\u0027m not going to deal with this. I\u0027m out of here. She was like, fine, get out of my house right now. So I go get Candido, in the back yard studying chess."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"I carry my chess books with me."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"He has a chess book."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"My chess board."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"But, you know, we\u0027re happy so I don\u0027t feel like a chess widow anymore, so it\u0027s OK. So I go tell him we have to leave."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"So we pack. And as we\u0027re packing-- and I know something\u0027s going to happen because we have to have that blow up, you know? We go outside, and there\u0027s a black cloud right on top of the house. And it starts to rain on top of the house. It wasn\u0027t raining any other place. There was sun all over the place, except on top of the house. So I said OK, this is the universe playing a trick on us or God laughing at us."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"And her mother says, take them to the train station."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"Her mother doesn\u0027t know anything."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"So I know we\u0027re not going to make it to the train station because in the car we are going to blows. So she takes the back roads down the tomato fields and she begins to berate us."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"She starts arguing. She just rehashes the whole argument all over again and how we couldn\u0027t make it on our own to the train station."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"You\u0027re so smart, why don\u0027t you make it on your own?"},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"And we had just done it before--"},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"I\u0027m in Arkansas, that\u0027s why."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"That\u0027s true. So she says, if you don\u0027t let me speak, I\u0027m going to throw you out of the car."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"So we said, throw us out."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"Throw us out."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"Which she did."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"She gets out of the car.

I mean, there\u0027s like 50 cars now looking at us. People getting out of the cars."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"And leaves us with our bags, walking down this road."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"But we have a cart. So we put all the bags in the cart. And suddenly, we feel free."},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"We start laughing."},{"speakerName":"Candido Tirado","text":"We start laughing. And we never felt so free in this three weeks. It was like five miles away from the train station. As we walk down this straight, narrow road I started thinking about the soldiers in World War II when the war was over. And they were going home and they had won the war. And Carmen and I are walking--"},{"speakerName":"Carmen Rivera","text":"We looked at each other, and we talked about that, this war that we\u0027d just been through.

Act Three, On the Road in a Tuxedo."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"There are two ways you feel when you interview a celebrity. There are those that make you feel like a person.

They will not remember you."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"10 years ago reporter Margy Rochlin was sent to do a magazine story about George Burns.

Plus weeklong stints in Vegas and Atlantic City."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is the story of a road trip as business not pleasure. George\u0027s entourage in its entirety at that time included Irving Fein, his then 77-year-old manager, and Morty Jacobs, his piano player for, at that time, 23 years."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"From the start it was clear to Margy, they were kind men, they were polite men. They called her \"kid\" the way they called everybody \"kid.\" They reminded her a lot of some of her older Jewish relatives. But this was a blip story."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"9 o\u0027clock Friday night, Moscow, Idaho. University Inn. We sit around in the common living room that connects George and Irving\u0027s bedrooms. George and Irving always get connected bedrooms, with a living room in between if they can. In the late afternoon when it\u0027s quiet, this is where George and Irving like to sit. They watch television. They read the trades."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Right now Morty\u0027s here. The sun is set and it\u0027s early evening. In general, they have three main topics of conversation, the act, the schedule, and where they want to eat. Here\u0027s some typical dialogue. Morty will say, \"Where should we eat?\" And Irving will say, \"The Broiler Room.\" That\u0027s the hotel steakhouse. And then George will say, \"John will know.\" John\u0027s the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove us to the hotel. And then Irving will say, \"I think we should do the Broiler Room.\" And then George will say, \"John will know. Ask John.\" And then Irving will say, \"I\u0027m making a reservation at the Broiler Room.\" But not moved towards the telephone. And on and on and on. It\u0027s like dialogue that David Mamet would write if David Mamet wrote scenes where absolutely nothing was at stake."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"We head down to the Broiler Room. All through dinner there\u0027s this constant traffic of fans, including at one point four cheerleaders. They\u0027re wearing short skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the room. \"Go, George, Go!\" they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattle their crepe paper pom poms. Then, floor show over, they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Then in comes the chef to ask for George\u0027s autograph. But George Burns likes these intrusions. He\u0027s nourished by them. When it\u0027s finally quite he says to me, \"Aren\u0027t people nice?\""},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Because I\u0027m a reporter, I\u0027m a blip. But the public gets his full attention. He establishes eye contact with each approaching fan and he smiles at them and he asks how they\u0027re doing. And when he leaves the Broiler Room, he\u0027ll choose the most complicated route, slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room, touching people on the shoulder lightly, and saying things like, \"Don\u0027t pay the check.\""},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"It\u0027s nice to be here. It\u0027s nice to be anywhere."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"While we\u0027re on the road I probably see him do his act five times. Each time it sounds totally spontaneous, like he\u0027s making it up right there, just riffing for the crowd, even though, give or take a gag or two, it\u0027s the exact same act he\u0027s been doing for 15 years."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"And thank you for that standing ovation. But it made me nervous. See, as a rule, an entertainer gets a standing ovation at the end of the show. You were afraid I wouldn\u0027t last that long."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"What\u0027s amazing about all this is that on the surface the act doesn\u0027t seem to vary from city to city. But to George it\u0027s an eternal work in progress. Every night he makes microscopic changes. Maybe he\u0027ll decide to sing \"Young at Heart\" before \"Old Bones.\" When he does this, he gets all worked up about it, thinks about it all day long. But this is how he\u0027s been able to be on the road for so long. This is how he keeps the act feeling fresh for himself."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Sometimes he\u0027ll change a punchline. He has a gag in his act about people having to retire when they\u0027re 70. He says, \"When I was 70, I had pimples.\" But one day George tries out a new line on me. He says, \"When I was 70, I had cupid\u0027s eczema.\" I think that sounds sort of dirty, but I\u0027m not going to be the one to tell him. In fact, I have tape of this, of myself lying to the nicest man on earth."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"What would you think that is, cupid\u0027s eczema?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Is that like, I don\u0027t know, young--"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"It doesn\u0027t sound dirty, does it?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"Good. OK. That\u0027s all."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Is it?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"No. It\u0027s not supposed to be."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Oh. No it doesn\u0027t sound dirty."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"When I was 70 I had cupid\u0027s eczema."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"Well, that is dirty."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"It isn\u0027t dirty. You\u0027re making it dirty. You don\u0027t know what cupid\u0027s eczema is. It could be anything."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"Well, eczema is a--"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"A rash."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"A rash. And cupid is the love. It\u0027s a love rash."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"OK. A love rash. What\u0027s dirty about a love rash?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"That\u0027s true."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"George and Irving can go on like this for hours. They go back and forth and back and forth. And that night, George tries out the cupid\u0027s eczema line. It doesn\u0027t get laughs. On the way home in the car we\u0027re silent. George and a driver in the front. Me in the back, squeezed hip to elbow between Irving and Morty. Suddenly, George\u0027s rumbling voice cuts through the darkness. \"I\u0027ll never do that again,\" he says. It\u0027s quiet for a while more. \"Morty,\" he says, \"tomorrow night let\u0027s--\" and then the conversation starts all over again."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Normally when I think of going on the road, I think of waking up at any hour, of not having to be anywhere at a certain time. You\u0027re on a big adventure. The rules no longer apply. There\u0027s no accountability. But that\u0027s a civilian\u0027s road trip. I am on a very different kind of road trip."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"The road trip I\u0027m on is not about adventure and unpredictability. The road trip I\u0027m on is about making sure that everything is the same. This is the secret to George Burns\u0027 longevity, of how he\u0027s been able to stay on the road for so long without going crazy. He wakes up at a certain time. He goes to sleep at a certain time."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"When he goes on the road, he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning. When he agrees to a booking it\u0027s stipulated in his contract that he\u0027ll be provided with a backless stool to sit on, a lightly rehearsed orchestra, an ashtray to flick his ashes in, and a pre-show speed ball made up of a couple of martinis chased by a cup of black coffee. He will only smoke El Productos. In the afternoon he likes to take a two hour nap. He hates fresh fruit and vegetables."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"By the end of our time together, I could order for him in a restaurant if necessary. He likes bay shrimp cocktails. He likes roast chicken. He likes his martinis, but doesn\u0027t care what brand of liquor they\u0027re made with. He just wants them to come one after the other. He is 92 and no one can tell him what is good or bad for him to put in his own mouth. Same goes for what comes out of it."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"As the gin and vermouth kick in, his conversation tends to get naughty. One night he recites to me a particularly memorable limerick that involves a mouse, the phrase \"hickory dickory dock\" and a reference to his own private parts. Morty and Irving laugh, but I don\u0027t know what to do. If I laugh too hard, I\u0027m scared they\u0027re going to think I\u0027m some sort of slut girl. And if I don\u0027t, then I\u0027m a pill, no fun at all. I feel as if I\u0027m in another country with different customs and mores, and so I simply try every possible reaction one after the other, laughing, groaning, shaking my head, waiting for something that works."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"The pace is very slow. I wake up in the morning, drink coffee, wait for Irving\u0027s call. Mostly I have free time. I lay on a variety of queen-sized beds in a variety of shag carpet hotel rooms and stare up at the ceiling."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"One day Irving calls to invite me to talk to George as he eats breakfast."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"You want something, kid?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Nah. I\u0027m just going to--"},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"I could have ordered something for you."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"It\u0027s OK. I already had breakfast."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"You did, eh?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Yes, I did."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"Did you do your cereal already, George?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"No. I don\u0027t know if I can do the cereal."},{"speakerName":"Irving Fein","text":"You can do the cereal, George."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"George is wearing a thick beige terry cloth bathrobe, beige pajamas, and slippers. His stiff grey toupee is somewhere in the other room. It\u0027s startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair, the stacked heeled shoes, the crisp tuxedo. He looks vulnerable, bird like."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"I have this realization. This will be a man who I will get to know in the moments between words. Even on a road trip designed to avoid surprises, I find myself surprised by these men. My view of them comes to change as we spend more time together."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"11:00 AM. Reno, Nevada, Bally\u0027s hotel. I\u0027m trying to keep my focus, but I\u0027m tired. Tired of the empty hours, tired of waiting for Irving to call. Whenever I call my boyfriend, his answering machine picks up. Finally I take the elevator to the hotel casino. I play the slot machines, mindlessly pulling down the handle. Somehow Irving finds me. I\u0027m playing the quarter slots. I\u0027m risking a grand total of $10, but he\u0027s positive that I will return home having handed over the title to my car. He goes away, then comes back and tells me it\u0027s time to quit. He goes away, then comes back 15 minutes later and tells me again. I\u0027m annoyed at his nagging, and touched. To save me from financial ruin, he asks me to take a walk with him."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Irving takes my hand and loops it past his bent elbow. Arm in arm, we stroll past places with names like The Mapes Hotel and the Liberty Bell Saloon. The way Irving is almost bouncing down the street lets me know he\u0027s enjoying that we come off like a mismatched couple, that I\u0027m his babe and he is my silver-haired, energetic sugar daddy."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Most of the time Irving does the talking. He tells me about his past. It\u0027s a history of 20th century show business, big jobs at CBS radio, in the movie studios. Jack Benny hired him to be the president of his production company. It\u0027s a long story. Every once in awhile, though, Irving asks me personal questions about my family, about my friends, about my boyfriend. And then we head back to the hotel."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"And when we get to my room, he drops me off with this thought. He says, \"Leave your boyfriend. He\u0027s no good. Find someone else.\" And he walks away, and I stand there feeling conflicted. I think, I\u0027m no longer a blip to Irving, but who does he think he is? He doesn\u0027t know me. He\u0027s never met my boyfriend. A couple of years later I foll his advice. And every once in awhile I think back, trying to remember what it was that I said to him, what allowed him to distill this conclusion from my small talk. How come he knew something that took so long for me to figure out?"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"All I could come up with was how transparent I must have seemed to these men. Transparent like teenagers are to me. I mean, how many different human stories are there? These men had already been there."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Finally, we are on the road for so long that George is treating me like old news, which is where you want to be with George. When Irving lets me into George\u0027s suite before a show, George emerges from his room wearing shiny patent leather loafers, a crisp white shirt, a bow tie, and a knee-length paisley dressing down. He is pantless. He doesn\u0027t want to put on his tuxedo slacks until the very last minute so they don\u0027t lose their knife-sharp crease."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"In the pocket of these pants is a watch chain. On the watch chain is Gracie\u0027s tiny gold wedding ring. The way he tells the story of their marriage is that he discovered his one true talent when he met Gracie Allen. And he stayed married to her for 38 years. He was the brains of the act, the one who wrote almost every word she said. But she was the one who the public loved. He tells me that since her death in 1964, he visits her once a month at Forest Lawn Cemetery so he can tell her what\u0027s been going on in his life. But at first, his need to see her was so great that he\u0027d go every day."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"Tonight he shows me the ring."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"When Gracie died, it was terrible. Terribly dry. Then finally I started sleeping in Gracie\u0027s bed, and that helped a lot. The night where Gracie died, that night, Bobby Darin said to me, George-- Mr. Burns he always called me-- he says, you don\u0027t want to sleep alone. Why don\u0027t I go home and sleep with you? I says, Bobby I\u0027d love it."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"That\u0027s a wonderful thing to do."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"Yeah, he slept with me that night."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"But I mean, did it take you a long time to get your life back together?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"I was shocked when Gracie died. I didn\u0027t think Gracie should die. But you can\u0027t do anything."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"So, how long did it take you to get back to work?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"I started to work right away. That got nothing to with it. Show business has got nothing to do with that. You\u0027re doing your act. You\u0027re making a living. It\u0027s a different kind of--"},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"But at that time, you were financially solvent. I mean, you had plenty of money. Wasn\u0027t it more just to take your mind off of things?"},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"I\u0027ve got plenty of money now and I\u0027m working."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"But you enjoy it."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"That\u0027s right."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"OK, so at that time was it more to-- what are you going to do? Just sit around."},{"speakerName":"George Burns","text":"What would you do if somebody died? You sit home and cry? How long can you cry? Cry for two hours? You cry. And you cry, and you cry. Finally there are no more tears. Now you go to work. And you feel bad. Every time you come home, you feel bad because Gracie isn\u0027t there."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"One night, years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in west Los Angeles when I saw George come in. He was with a couple of men and a youngish woman. And they all hovered around him. He had aged so much. He moved slowly and was so tiny that he seemed to be lost inside of the dark suit he was wearing. They all slipped into a red booth and ordered dinner. I think the waiter brought George a martini."},{"speakerName":"Margy Rochlin","text":"When it was time to go, I walked right by him, but I didn\u0027t say hello. To George I was always a blip, just another friendly face on the road."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Margy Rochlin is a magazine writer in Los Angeles."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Four, Paw Paw for Jesus. So what we want on the road, many of us, is adventure. And what is adventure but a moment or a series of moments that you never could\u0027ve predicted before you left home?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We have this story about one such moment from Cheryl Trykv. A warning to listeners with children in their car. This story contains a lot of anti-social behavior."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"It\u0027s 1990 and she\u0027s wearing a 1977 bleached blond Farrah Fawcett feather do and electric blue Maybelline mascara which contrast nicely with the lime green polyester manager\u0027s pantsuit she\u0027s got on. And she\u0027s telling me, no, not for under $50 dollars a night. Not for under $50 a night will she let me leave my car in the parking lot of her Paw Paw, Michigan Speedway convenience store gas station. This, after an hour and a half of my going in and out, buying chips and juice and cigarettes, wondering what I\u0027m going to do with the Ford Lynx I have borrowed from a friend, which has now got a split valve or something and is busted all to hell and I\u0027m in the middle of goddamn nowhere on the other side of Dowagiac on my way to Kalamazoo for a getaway weekend. I wanted to see America."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"I ask her why I can\u0027t leave my car in the parking lot. She says it\u0027s the rule. I ask who makes the decisions about that rule. She says she does. She says, company policy. Well, whose company is it? She tells me it\u0027s her company and she doesn\u0027t break the rules. Well, you little [BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP] can you be a friend, I\u0027m thinking to myself. I don\u0027t say it, but boy I\u0027d like to."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"Instead I remind her very softly about American hospitality and how Americans are known the world over for their friendly, peaceful, helping nature. I tell her that I noticed on my way in through her charming little town a sweet and simple church with a banner out front that read \"Bold yet humble. Paw Paw for Jesus.\" There are few customers in the store, so I say it again, louder. Paw Paw for Jesus. Paw Paw for Jesus."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"An older gentlemen with an Abraham Lincoln beard and an Elvis Presley coiffe stares at me blankly. The manager tells me to cut the crap and get out of the store. OK, I say to her. I look at her name badge, Mary Ann. I\u0027ll get out of your store. But I ain\u0027t never coming back to Paw Paw."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"And I turn and walk away. As I walk away, I accidentally shove my body against a candy bar display case, knocking over hundreds and thousands of Three Musketeers, Reese\u0027s, Special Dark, and Snickers. Sweet Tarts fly and spill. A grand gesture of public nuisance. That\u0027s it, missus, Mary Ann says from behind the counter. Your big city ass is cooked. I\u0027m calling the police. You idiot, I think to myself on my way out the door. Do I look married to you?"},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"I make it to the highway in no time flat, speed walk backwards with my thumb in the air, calling out to passing cars, Paw Paw for Jesus, Paw Paw for Jesus. A few cars honk and wave, but nobody stops."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"I can\u0027t imagine it might be what I\u0027m wearing, the same jet black cocktail dress I wore the night before. Maybe my lipstick is too blood red for broad daylight in a small town like Paw Paw. Maybe I just don\u0027t seem like I belong here. Finally a van pulls over. It\u0027s a Chevy van, one with a mural painted on the side depicting what King Arthur and Guinevere might look like in the year 2500."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"King Arthur wears a gold mesh nuclear cleanup suit. He carries a sword in one hand and a laser gun in the other. Guinevere is nude and amply buxom. Where her pubic hair might be she holds the Holy Grail. The driver leans over and opens the door. It\u0027s a man. What a surprise. I get in."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"He asks how it is he\u0027s never seen me before. Maybe because I don\u0027t pose nude for Playboy. At the mention of Playboy, he steps on the gas, speeds it to 105. I\u0027ve never gone 105 in a Chevy van before. it feels pretty good. Faster, I say, and we both start laughing."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"I roll down my window, stick my head out, and yell Paw Paw for Jesus to the wind. I feel like taking off my top, but I don\u0027t. Instead I sit back down into the passenger seat, bucket, severely vinyl, light a cigarette and enjoy as best I can the REO Speedwagon tape he\u0027s got blasting. He asks me why I\u0027m hitchhiking, and just as he does, a sheriff\u0027s car speeds past us on its way back into town. That\u0027s why, I say. Cops."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"What have I got against cops, he wants to know. Nothing, it\u0027s just that I\u0027m allergic to pork. It occurs to me at this point to shut up. I really don\u0027t know this man and, in all likelihood, he is brother of Mary Ann, manager of the speedway who is daughter of the Sheriff of Paw Paw and that I am headed for a trap."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"And in one great, whirling moment of brilliance it becomes very clear to me what I must do and that is sham this vic. It isn\u0027t all that difficult. I\u0027ve seen it in the movies. Just before Treat Williams gets his hair shaved in the woods, Beverly D\u0027angelo steals a four door Ford from an army officer by seducing him down to his underwear. She takes off with this car, his money, and his clothes, which is exactly what I mean to do."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"To prepare myself for this role of a lifetime, I change the tape to \"Hotel California.\" The vic\u0027s neck is nasty with sweat, which I ordinarily wouldn\u0027t mind. But it has the stale, sweet taste of a flat Mountain Dew. I force myself to enjoy it. By the end of \"A Last Resort,\" \"New Kid in Town,\" \"Wasted Time,\" and \"Wasted Time Reprise,\" he is down to his Fruit of the Loom and I am wearing dark blue corduroy Levis, a Queen concert t-shirt, and a feed cap with an American flag that reads \"Try Burning This One Mother[BLEEP].\""},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"Shortly, I create in him the most urgent desire to pull over to the side of the road. And while I\u0027m straddling his lap I somehow open the door with my foot and with my very strong legs kick him out of the van, down onto the asphalt, his stunned, sorry eyes looking up at me in surprise. Did you lose something?"},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"30 miles or so up the road I spot a hitch hiker. Hmm, somebody needs a ride. I pull over. She\u0027s a frosty little lezebel with a shaved head and a backpack. She asks me where I\u0027m going."},{"speakerName":"Cheryl Trykv","text":"To hell.
