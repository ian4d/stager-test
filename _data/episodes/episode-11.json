        "Perhaps Randy feels sorry for chrome-dome Annette. Maybe that\u0027s why he was seen twice in her company in a single five-day period. Seen standing together in the parking lot of the Burger Tabernacle-- her home away from home-- and seen huddled together, laughing on the escalator of the Crabtree Valley Mall. Annette, my supposed best friend, who secretly wanted and coveted everything I owned. Is everyone on earth as two-faced as Annette Kelper? Is everyone as cruel as Randy Sykes? I think not.",
        "Most of you, the loved ones I left behind, are simple, devoted people. I urge you now to take a look around the room. Are Randy Sykes and Annette sitting in the audience? Are they shifting uncomfortably in the pew, shielding their faces with the 8 and 1/2 by 11 photograph of me I had reproduced to serve as a memento of this occasion?",
        "Eileen, read this part real fast before they have a chance to leave. Randy Sykes\u0027 drip is the size of my little finger, and that\u0027s when it\u0027s hard. And I\u0027m not counting the nail-- just the finger. He had sex two times with a boy at Camp Ticonderoga when he was in junior high school. Maybe that explains why he loves it with somebody sticks their finger up his [? couvade. ?] He used to beg me to do that, but I refused. I said, \"No way, Randy.\" He used to do it to himself all the time. That\u0027s why I never held hands with him. His hands stink.",
        "He secretly thinks he looks like Marlon Brando, but take a good look. A young Marlin Perkins is more like it. Maybe that\u0027s what he sees in Annette Kelper. He\u0027s an animal lover. She used to come to my house crying. Her breath smelled a mile off, like her uncle\u0027s drip. She said he forced her, but that\u0027s a lie, because you don\u0027t force whores. And that\u0027s what she is, a whore.",
        "Annette and Randy deserve each other. Drip-Breath and Stinky-Finger, riding up and down the escalator at Crabtree Valley, up and down, up and down. Fancy little shuck-cutlets. Look at them. Take a good, hard look at them. It\u0027s their fault I\u0027m dead. They are to blame.",
        "I urge you now to take those paperweights and stone them. Release your anger. The Bible says it\u0027s all right to cast the first stone if someone dead is telling you do it. And I\u0027m telling you now. Pretend the paperweights are stones and cast them upon the guilty. I put aside my savings to pay for the damages to the walls and windows. It\u0027s money I was saving for my wedding, and there\u0027s plenty of it. So throw. Hurt them the way they hurt me. Kill them! Nobody will hold you responsible. Kill them!",
        "Eileen, I\u0027m going to allow a few minutes here because it might take a while for certain people to get into the swing of it. Pop in the cassette marked \"Stoning,\" and wait until both Randy and Annette are lifeless. Wait until everyone is finished with their paperweights. And then I want you to hand the microphone over to my mother. Watch the way she trembles and stutters, and remember every gesture as if you were me.",
        "Dear friends and family, by the time you receive this letter, I will be dead. Those of you attending this service are sitting quietly holding a beautiful paperweight, a gift from the collection which, in life, had been my pride and joy. You turn the paperweight over in your hands, look deep inside at the object embedded in the glass, be it a rose or a scorpion, whatever. And through your tears, you ask, what is death like?",
        "By this time, I certainly know the answer to that question, but I\u0027m unable to give details. Know only that I will one day meet you upon the grassy plains of heaven where, with the exception of Randy Sykes and Annette Kelper, I will be tickled to embrace you and catch up on all the news.",
        "If my instructions were followed the way I wanted them to be-- see attached instruction envelope number one-- this letter is being read to you from the pulpit of the Simple Shepherd Church of Christ by my best friend, Eileen Mickey-- hi, Eileen-- who is wearing the long-sleeve Lisa Montino designer dress I left behind that always looked so good on me.",
        "Eileen, I hope you either lost some weight or took it out some on the sides, or you\u0027re not going to be able to breathe. Also remember, it needs to be dry cleaned. I know how you and your family love to skimp. But please, don\u0027t listen to what anyone says about Woolite. Dry clean.",
        "Most of you are probably wondering why I did it. You\u0027re whispering, \"Why, Lord? Why take Trish Moody? Trish was a ray of bright sunshine, always so up and perky and full of love. Pretty, too. Just as smart and sweet and pretty as they come.\"",
        "You\u0027re probably shaking your heads and thinking there\u0027s plenty of people a lot worse than Trish Moody. There\u0027s her former excuse for a boyfriend, Randy Sykes, for example. The boyfriend who, after Trish accidentally backed her car over his dog, practically beat her senseless. He beat her with words, but still, it might as well have been with his fists. He struck her again and again with words and names such as \"manipulative,\" \"jealous,\" \"childish,\" and others I wouldn\u0027t justify in print. The dog\u0027s death was a tragic accident, but perhaps also a blessing in disguise, as Randy tended to spend entirely too much time with it.",
        "What did Trish\u0027s mother say when her daughter, heartbroken over her breakup with Randy, came to her in search of love and understanding? If you\u0027re looking for sympathy, you can find it between \"sob story\" and \"syphilis\" in the dictionary. Perhaps my mother can live with slogans such as this. I know I can\u0027t.",
        "Neither can I live surrounded by friends such as Annette Kelper. Poor, chubby Annette Kelper, who desperately tries to pretend that nobody notices the fact that she\u0027s balding on top of her head. That\u0027s right. Look closely. Balding, just like a man."

            "\"I\u0027ll pour this pestilence into his ear. So will I make the net that will enmesh them all.\" It\u0027s an adult, Iago, who says that in Othello. And it\u0027s grownups that Machiavelli was writing about when he wrote The Prince, his book about manipulating others and seizing power. Notice he titled the book The Prince, not The Little Prince. The Little Prince is actually by somebody else, if you don\u0027t know that.",
            "Entice. Entice is a very--",
            "Keep going, baby. You\u0027re on a roll. You\u0027re on such a roll here. Sure.",
            "What is the phone number?",
            "Do it again.",
            "And I just want to say that we are so anxious to get you to call. We have very special premiums that we\u0027re offering during the coming hour that are available at no other time during the drive. We have three and a half or four, depending on how you count them. The very first one-- I\u0027m going to play a little clip of these. These are all audio things. Well, how to begin with this?",
            "But in our American lives, the real era of intrigue and manipulation for most of us is not adulthood. It\u0027s adolescence, when our social circle is at its most constricting. Today on our program, a story of betrayal and of someone who holds David Koresh-like powers over others, and who is only in the seventh grade. From WBEZ in Chicago, it\u0027s Your Radio Playhouse. I\u0027m Ira Glass.",
            "Well, one of them is we have a cassette of recent work by David Sedaris, much of it heard here on Your Radio Playhouse, some of it heard on Morning Edition. This is all new work, including two radio dramas by the Pinetree Gang, which appear here on Your Radio Playhouse. That\u0027s one thing.",
            "Another thing is we have this very odd CD called Shut Up, Little Man, which listeners to the show heard. It\u0027s a sort of audio verite of these two men recorded through the walls of their apartment as they argued with each other.",
            "And finally, we have this thing. Two weeks ago, we had a show where Julia Sweeney told the story of getting cancer. And she told the story of herself getting cancer and of her brother getting cancer. And she told them as stand-up comedy. And she was telling this in a place called Un-Cabaret. It\u0027s a club in Los Angeles where essentially, comics come each week, and they tell what are basically comic diary versions of their week.",
            "And Un-Cabaret has a CD that\u0027s really pretty wonderful with some well-known people and some not-so-well-known people. And here\u0027s a sample. They have about 10 minutes of Julia Sweeney\u0027s cancer stories. Here\u0027s a sample of that.",
            "All right, so that\u0027s Julia Sweeney. If you want that and more-- and more diary entries from Janeane Garofalo and people who seem less well known. But there\u0027s Julia Sweeney, Janeane Garofalo, Beth Lapides, Bob Goldthwait, Taylor Negron, Dana Gould, other people. Ask for that when you call. 832-3160. Shirley, you\u0027re still there, right?",
            "But before we get into the body of our story, we will try, as adults, to manipulate you a little bit at Pledge Central. Let\u0027s check in with Pledge Central. Shirley Jahad.",
            "And, Shirley, what is the magic word? We haven\u0027t even gotten to the extra-special premium. What is the magic word?",
            "You can super size it. That\u0027s right. If you make the $60 pledge and just say super size it, for another $4.95, you get--",
            "Here we go. I think I\u0027ve got it. This one starts kind of slow. This is a punk \"La Bamba.\" They have a little collection of all sorts of \"La Bambas.\" It\u0027s one of the most covered songs in music. We have the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. We have punk versions. We have Neil Diamond. This is kind of a surf version. Again, we want you to pledge. We want to please you.",
            "No, that\u0027s OK. So the idea is 60 bucks for one of the premia and $64.95 for one of the premia plus--",
            "It makes a fine, fine summertime present for anyone.",
            "OK, Shirley. I\u0027ll check back with you in a bit.",
            "So let\u0027s get to today\u0027s story on this, our radio show. This is a story of enemies. But some of the bitterest enemies are people who used to be close friends. And our story begins with the friendship of these two boys named Bob and Dave. And today\u0027s program will be in four acts. Act One, Dave\u0027s Love.",
            "Act Two, Dave\u0027s Hate.",
            "Act Three, Dave Today.",
            "Act Four, Another Dave. That another Dave is David Sedaris, actually. We have a story by David Sedaris coming up.",
            "Hi.",
            "I guess \"manipulate\" has the tune of a negative connotation.",
            "Yeah, and we have all these--"

            "So he would have a camera and take a lot of pictures. And he wanted me to pull down my pants and take a picture of me with my pants down. And I was refusing to do it. I would not let it be caught on film. And he was just insisting, and he went through this entire-- I mean, he was trying to coax me for so long, telling me all these different things that he was going to do for me and saying, \"Oh, nobody\u0027s going to see it.\" And he came up with this whole scheme of how nobody would see the film and everything and just these elaborate, elaborate plans on how nobody would see these pictures. And I just kept refusing and refusing and refusing.",
            "And finally, at the end of it, he was like, \"All right, just take down you pants anyway. I won\u0027t take a picture. I swear to you. I won\u0027t take a picture, I promise.\" And I still didn\u0027t believe him. And he was like, \"Look, I promise. I promise. I promise,\" This went on for like an hour, of him trying to coax me to take my pants down. And he promised me, bottom of his heart, that he was not going to take a picture.",
            "And so I was like, fine. So I like unbuckled my belt, and I unbuckled my pants. And I pulled down my zipper, and I whipped open my pants. And I had my underwear on. And then I put myself all back together again. And when I had my pants open, he took a picture. And I was like, \"Ah!\"",
            "And I was terrified because when you\u0027re that age, when you\u0027re 11 and 12 years old, you can\u0027t go in and get your pictures developed yourself and pay for them and get them. And I thought, somebody is going to get these pictures developed, and somebody is going to see them.",
            "So weeks later, I was going up to his house again. And in the car going up to his house-- his mother was driving-- he was like, \"I got the pictures back.\" And I said, \"Oh, my god.\" And he was like, \"You\u0027re not going to believe what\u0027s on there.\" And I said, \"But what can be? You didn\u0027t see anything.\" And he\u0027s like, \"I know, but you have to see this because it\u0027s there.\" And I was like, \"But it can\u0027t be because I didn\u0027t take my pants down.\" And he was like, \"I know, but it\u0027s there. It\u0027s there. You have to see it.\"",
            "He pulls out the pictures, and I looked at it. And my penis was hanging out there. And I was like, \"But I didn\u0027t do it.\" And he was like, \"You must\u0027ve.\" And I said, \"But I know I didn\u0027t. I know I just opened my pants.\" And he said, \"You must\u0027ve done it. Maybe it just fell out or something.\" And I said, \"But it can\u0027t be.\" And we racked our brains just trying to figure out what had happened, because I knew that I hadn\u0027t pulled my underwear down.",
            "So that night, we were at a high school football game. And we were looking at the pictures again, just examining them. We were way up in the bleachers in a corner. And we took them out, and we were looking at them. And we were trying to explain what had happened. And finally, we figured out that it was the inside of my belt that looked like my penis.",
            "And we\u0027re like, \"Oh!\" And so I was completely relieved, but I made him-- I watched him just tear up the picture into a thousand pieces and went through this whole elaborate method to bury the pieces in the bottom of a trash can at this football stadium. And I was still petrified that somebody was going to find them and piece them together.",
            "The point that it started to change was, as we were going into sixth grade, we were constantly being separated in class. And that\u0027s around the time when people start to realize that there\u0027s a difference between someone who\u0027s straight and someone who\u0027s gay. And there was just grumblings happening. People were accusing us of being homosexual.",
            "And we weren\u0027t in any way, but we also knew of all the things that we had done with each other in each other\u0027s presence. And I think when people started to think that we were gay, that just rose to the surface, and we realized that there was a cool thing and a not cool thing. And we were definitely not cool in the friendship that we were in.",
            "Dave and I became friends in fourth grade, and we were friends through sixth grade. And I have to describe him physically because that\u0027s a huge part of his personality. He was-- and he still is-- an extremely wiry person. Very thin. He looks emaciated. And he also, his skin is like a jaundiced yellow color. He was always very acned. Just very pale, pasty, and he just looked sick.",
            "And that\u0027s also around that time when-- in my town, at least, and I think in a lot of small towns-- is where sports just become the most important thing in your life. And I was not a good athlete then at all. Dave was a good athlete. And Dave organized a big football party one weekend where we were going to go out there and play football and have a sleepover and then the next day, play more football.",
            "Dave just organized this thing unbelievably. He had jerseys printed up with numbers and names on them. He had teams with rosters. He had practice for his team with plays. There was a playbook. This is for a little football game, like three-on-three football or four-on-four football. Touch football.",
            "And every single minute was decided upon beforehand by him as to what we would do, where we would be, what we would eat, the food we would eat, when we would play football. It was all timed out. He was so organized and anal retentive about it. I don\u0027t remember very well, but I can\u0027t imagine that I played tremendously well.",
            "I was thinking about this today. I was trying to think of the moment when everything changed. And I\u0027m almost positive it was that event. It was the football party. And immediately after that, he just totally stopped talking to me.",
            "I don\u0027t really know how we became friends. We were in class together in grade school. But as things progressed into fifth grade, it became pretty clear that our friendship was the most intense friendship in the class. We would talk on the phone at least once a day and for hours. We would just talk for hours and just make each other laugh so hard. And that was why we always got separated in class was just because we weren\u0027t troublemakers, we just made each other laugh a lot. We had very similar senses of humor.",
            "The scatological jokes were the primary jokes. And I was just thinking about this today. I remembered this one thing that we used to do, which we did obsessively. It\u0027s embarrassing to say it, but we were obsessed with the words \"poop\" and \"pee.\" And we made this little thing where I would say \"poop\" and he would say \"pee,\" and then he would say \"wee,\" and then I would say \"gilly gee.\" And so it\u0027d go kind of like, poop, pee, wee, gilly gee. And we said this over and over and over again. And we used to just take books and just insert the words \"poop\" and \"pee\" everywhere.",
            "And \"wee\" was like the one word that was just, for some reason, that was like our rallying call. That was like our motto. We just said it all the time. Just \"wee.\" Wee! We used to do that all the time. Wee!",
            "Some of the other stuff that we had in common-- our favorite group was The Village People. And we used to listen to The Village People all the time and just totally obsess about them, having no idea what they were singing about at all. And the Dukes of Hazzard was another one, and Star Wars. Those were very big things. And sports.",
            "I basically discovered sexuality through him. And we used to play spin the bottle in his room. And we would take off an article of clothing when it would land on us. And it was the first time we\u0027d ever been naked in front of another person except for our parents. And it was petrifying, but it was also just this whole discovery period of seeing another man naked there.",
            "And it became this whole game that we played often. And we would revel in the fact of standing there in front of each other totally naked, assuming these characters like, \"Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you? Nice to meet you.\" Businessmen and everything, just standing there completely buck naked and so terrified that we were ever going to get caught, because his parents were always home. They were always in the house and everything, and we were just so afraid that someone was going to knock on the door.",
            "The one time that was the biggest scare was he-- Dave basically could get anybody to do anything that he wanted them to do. And he had a camera and was-- these times when I\u0027d go up to his house were fully documented events. He\u0027s very anal retentive. And he loved documenting everything was going on."

            "I remember going into class in seventh grade on the first day of school and him not talking to me and everybody just wondering. The whole school was wondering why there was this big fight going on between Dave and Bob. And I remember not having an answer for anybody. I used to tell them to ask Dave. I had no idea. And I used to tell people that he just stopped talking to me. And I remember that he became completely bent on turning everyone against me. The whole school. And he did it very well because he\u0027s so organized and because he\u0027s so manipulative.",
            "And I saw him. And I saw him telling people to say things to me. And he was one who formed the I Hate-- they used to call me [? Cooze ?] then. And he was the one who formed the I Hate [? Cooze ?] Club. He never did anything to me himself. He would never come up to me and make fun of me. He would never come up to me and hit me. He would never assault me personally. But he would just get everyone else to do it for him.",
            "So he would send people to say things to me. I remember one time in the lunchroom Sam saying, have you ever been caught masturbating? And of course, either answer is-- you damn yourself if you answer yes or if you answer no. And I remember hearing Dave tell him to ask me that.",
            "I used to just get made fun of horrendously by everyone. People would make fun of the way that I chewed at lunch. People would make fun of the way that I laughed. People would make fun of the way that I coughed, that I sneezed. People would make fun of the way that I walked. There was just this teasing. But that makes it even sound less violent than it was. It was just a mocking. It was a very pointed mocking on everyone\u0027s part.",
            "I remember sitting alone at the lunch table with no one to talk to and just wanting so badly for no one to turn their attention to me because I knew that the attention would be negative. I remember not understanding what was going on. I had been in such a sweet position with this person. We had such a good friendship. And then, all of a sudden, everyone had just turned against me.",
            "And he wasn\u0027t like a pied piper. He was so subtle, and he was so quiet. I don\u0027t think he ever had a friendship with people like he had with me. But he was just able to organize people into these different factions. He would just say, \"Go over to [? Cooze ?] and just shove him into a locker.\" And they\u0027d go do it.",
            "That was the worst period, I think, of my entire life was that period. I used to go home from school and cry after school. I used to go to my dog and hug my dog and say, you are my only friend in the world.",
            "Then he started to kind of needle me. I remember one thing that he did was there was this guy, Mike, in my class. And Mike was what we called in my hometown a scummer, which meant that he was on welfare. He perhaps didn\u0027t have a pair of pants for every day of the week. He was very smart, which was a strike against him at that age. And he just didn\u0027t fit in. He was a real geek. So Dave organized this fight between Mike and I-- a fist fight to prove who was the bigger faggot. Whoever would lose was the bigger faggot.",
            "And he positioned us-- he spun it so there was no way I could not fight. If I didn\u0027t have this fight, then things would just get worse for me. Things would get worse. Mike was at the bottom of the barrel, and I was there with him. And Dave had to prove that I was below him. And so he organized this whole fight. And everyone in the class was like, \"Are you going to fight Mike? Are you going to fight Mike?\"",
            "And I finally conceded. I conceded to fight him. Dave organized the whole event. It was to happen at this playground. And we went, and he tried to get this whole audience to come and see it. Unfortunately, nobody came but him-- well, I guess, fortunately. Nobody came but him and one other person.",
            "So Mike and I went there. And neither of us wanted to fight each other. Neither of us had any reason in the world to fight each other. So I just remember standing there facing him, just laughing, just like, what are we supposed to do? We\u0027re standing here. We\u0027ve been forced into this just to save our own souls. And now we have to inflict pain on each other. And we stood there for the longest time. And Dave kept trying to push us into fighting. He was saying, \"Come on. Just throw a punch. Just throw a punch. Just start.\"",
            "We waited for the longest time, and then finally, I was just like, this is ridiculous. So I went up, and I shoved him. And then we started to fight. We weren\u0027t really into fighting, but we had to do it then. And I pushed him at one point, and he fell backwards and he hurt his wrist. And I got on top of him. and I held his wrist. And I remember saying to him, \"Do you give up?\" And he wouldn\u0027t give up. And I was holding his wrist back.",
            "And each time I kept asking if he was going to give up, and he kept saying no. And each time he\u0027d say no, I\u0027d bend his wrist back a little bit more. And he was crying in pain. And I kept saying, I\u0027m going to bend it back. I\u0027m going to bend it back. I\u0027m going to bend it back, thinking, I don\u0027t want to break this person\u0027s wrist. I have no reason to break this person\u0027s wrist.",
            "And I was faced at that moment with either giving up and getting kicked even more or going ahead with really hurting this person and hoping that it would save me in some way. And I broke his wrist. He came in the next day into school with a cast on. I don\u0027t know how his family paid for his cast. And everybody saw that and said, \"You idiot, [? Cooze! ?] What did you do? You idiot!\" And it made it even worse.",
            "I just didn\u0027t understand. I didn\u0027t know what was going on. That\u0027s the most frustrating for me, even still today. I always thought it was me. I always thought it was something I was doing. I thought it was the way that I wore my clothes. I thought it was the shoes that I wore. I thought it was the way that I laughed. I remember.",
            "And I remember I tried to change these things. I tried not to laugh so loud. I tried to cough differently. They made fun of the most minuscule things that are just human, like chewing. If they would\u0027ve noticed the way that I breathed, they would have made fun of that. I remember I tried lifting weights. And it was impossible, because there was nothing I could do to make them change their minds. If I lifted weights, it was the way that I lifted weights. They would come up with something.",
            "It was a no-win situation. And I guess I knew how smart he was, and I knew how well he knew me. And I guess, all of a sudden, I had thought that he had seen all these things in me that were just wrong, just so not cool.",
            "I remember very clearly there was a moment that the clouds just cleared and everything became possible. I went to the Pennsylvania Governor\u0027s School for the Arts in my junior year. The summer between my junior and senior year, that was when I met people who were actors, like I was, who were my age and who respected me.",
            "And I remember very clearly, it was after lunch, and people who were in my theater class, we were going down to the cafeteria. And I had forgotten my bag in the cafeteria. And I said, \"Oh, just wait for me one second. I just want to get my bag.\" And I went down to the cafeteria, and I got my bag. And I came back up, and they were still there waiting for me. And I remember so distinctly remembering, \"Oh, my god. These people, they waited for me.\"",
            "That meant so much to me, because I felt like I\u0027m not this idiot. I\u0027m not this geek. I\u0027m not a person who everyone should hate. I\u0027m actually a pretty good human being, and people like me.",
            "Sometimes, I feel like there\u0027s some justice in the fact that I\u0027m surrounded now by many people who love me and respect me. And I don\u0027t know how many people he has in his life. But the tables have turned in that way.",
            "And when I go back home and I see people looking at me the way that they looked at me in high school, I think there is some justice in this, because those people are probably-- some of those people, I\u0027ve heard, are in bad situations with their families. They\u0027ve got wives they don\u0027t love. They\u0027ve been through divorces. They don\u0027t have any friends. They\u0027re in the same bar they were in four or five years ago, drinking the same beer they drank. And their gut is a little bigger, and their nose is a little redder. And they just look tired. And I feel like my life is in pretty good shape, and I\u0027m happy. And that\u0027s the sweetest revenge. And last Christmas, I ran into him at a mall. And he looked more jaundiced and more sickly than ever.",
            "If it weren\u0027t for Dave, I would not be doing what I\u0027m doing right now. There\u0027s no way. I don\u0027t know what I would have been doing, but because of what he did to me, I found theater, and it\u0027s been a really good life so far."

            "Blessing or a curse. And remember our three special premia. One is the Un-Cabaret CD, which is basically comics telling stories about their own lives. The second thing is the Shut Up, Little Man CD. And the third thing is David Sedaris, including lots of material heard on this program, but also, for example, the Christmas--",
            "No, I feel like we\u0027ve given that away too many times. I\u0027m sorry. But this year, David did a story for Morning Edition that we had to cut about three minutes out to fit it into a Morning Edition segment. People who buy the cassette will get the uncut version. And it\u0027s the story about how he was having a bad Christmas one year until his sister brought home a prostitute who she knew from work.",
            "\"Donna the Christmas Whore.\"",
            "Yeah, ho, ho, ho. And what\u0027s the number again?",
            "A heart-warming story for the whole family.",
            "In fact, you can get any premium that the station is selling. Anything. Anything you\u0027ve heard all day and that you\u0027re going to hear all week, and just say \"super size it.\" Only during this show. At $4.95, you get that \"La Bamba\" tape.",
            "Check back with you later, Shirley.",
            "Act Two, Dave\u0027s Hatred. Dave and Bob were best friends. And now Dave started using all the tactics that adults use in political situations, in power situations, all the tactics one uses to turn people against one another. Whispering in ears, things like that. Bob, who\u0027s now a theater director in New York City, by the way, Bob tells the story.",
            "Hey, honey.",
            "Bob says that it was because Dave made him an outcast in junior high school that he ended up spending a lot of time with the theater teacher. Because the other kids wouldn\u0027t talk to him. And this teacher put him in plays and took him to plays in New York City, showing him that there was a bigger world outside their hometown.",
            "Well, as we try to present here on this, our little Radio Playhouse radio show. Are people calling?",

If you say the thing about \"La Bamba\"-- if you say \"super size it\" for $4.95 extra, any premium this radio station has, including our three special premia tonight-- the Un-Cabaret CD, the David Sedaris tape, and the Shut Up, Little Man CD, they will throw in 90 minutes of various \"La Bambas.\" on top of it.",
            "And, Shirley, let me play another sample from this Un-Cabaret CD. Again, it\u0027s this unusual forum, which isn\u0027t exactly stand-up comedy. The comics come and tell stories about their own lives, every week in Los Angeles. If you were to fly to Los Angeles and go to this club, it would cost you hundreds and hundreds of dollars. But for just a $60 pledge, we\u0027re going to give you a CD, and for $64.95, a CD plus this fabulous music. And here\u0027s a sample of one of the bits. I\u0027ll just play it quick so people know what they\u0027re getting. This is a guy named Terry Sweeney. No relation to Julia Sweeney.",

He always used to use the term \"false friend\" in seventh and eighth grade. I remember that clearly. He used to always say I was his \"false friend.\"",
            "Well, what is it? I don\u0027t know. What does it mean? It means you were friends, but now it\u0027s fake or it\u0027s--",
            "Could be. It could be. God, wouldn\u0027t that be awful if it all boiled down to one event where he felt like me and Mike were becoming friends, and it could\u0027ve been cleared up in one conversation?",
            "That it was just a total tiny misunderstanding that could have been cleared up?",
            "Boy, I would just love to see what my life would have been like if that would have happened."

            "Well, Act Three, Dave\u0027s Response. It\u0027s an odd thing, actually, as a reporter, calling a stranger on the phone and asking him to defend things he did 15 years before as a teenager. Who amongst us wants to get that call? So I reached Dave at his parents\u0027 house, where he still lives. And he\u0027s a devout Christian now. He writes and edits a Christian magazine for young people. And he says he\u0027s never been happier.",
            "Can you imagine yourself being seen in that light?",
            "I\u0027ll tell you the way that Bob remembers and interprets what happened between the two of you. He doesn\u0027t remember it as being the kind of thing where he became friends with somebody else. He says that you guys were really, really close-- really close friends. And then, when everybody hit adolescence, a really typical thing happened to you, and that is that other boys started accusing you of being gay. And that you publicly wanted to put a stop to it.",
            "Actually, the thing that it\u0027s making me think about is, in the case of a story like this, I think it\u0027s easier for a person who was the injured person-- or believes they were the injured person-- to remember something than the person who did something hurtful. Because I think it\u0027s so much more embarrassing to remember yourself as being someone who did something hurtful.",
            "Hi, is Bob there?",
            "No, he does not really think about Bob very often. No, Bob is not a big figure in his life. No, he does not remember the fight with Mike. Yes, he remembers being enemies with Bob in the seventh grade. But no, he wasn\u0027t sure why. The best that he could remember, Bob was to blame. Bob, by becoming friends with someone else.",
            "So after I spoke with Dave, I called Bob. I guess you could figure that out for yourself, huh?",
            "You describe him going and whispering in people\u0027s ear, Iago-like, saying, go do this, go do that, walk up to Bob and say this to him, push him in the locker. And he remembers none of that.",
            "Well, he remembers none of it.",
            "Thinking about what happened to you, just thinking about it over the last few days, it\u0027s really made me think about what it means to love somebody. You know how when you love somebody, you\u0027re always more aware of what they do in the room than anybody else?",
            "And because you guys really loved each other, anything that he would do in a room would be something that would be more apparent to you than what anybody else was doing and would seem more important. So if somebody else were just as influential over other kids in the class, you would always be more aware of what Dave did.",
            "It\u0027s an odd thing to have a profound experience with somebody else, a really intimate experience, and you remember every detail. And the other person remembers none of it. And so you\u0027re left there alone. When I talked to Bob, I asked him about this over and over and over again because I thought it was such a particular kind of moment for him. But he didn\u0027t really take it that way.",
            "No, I don\u0027t mean animosity at all. Actually, in fact, just the opposite. Simply someone else to confirm that it happened. That it happened and that it had a meaning.",
            "As you were talking, I was thinking this is the Gabriel Garcia Marquez part of the story where, like, is memory lost? Does memory last? Does it mean anything if an entire nation forgets what it was? Or does it mean anything if we are the only one who remembers an experience and then we are lost, and so that experience is never remembered? Does it mean anything? And you\u0027re saying, really, no. Maybe it meant something to me, but no, not really.",
            "One loose end in the whole thing, of course, was the friend, the mysterious friend. Remember, Dave said that Bob was to blame for them becoming enemies in the seventh grade by making friends with a guy who, we were told, is named Mike, though not the Mike whose wrist Bob later broke.",
            "Meaning what?",
            "See, to me, false friend means that he thinks that you betrayed him.",
            "And he remembers-- is this also accurate or do you remember this as well? He remembers you turning other people against him. He says that at one point, there was actually a \"I Hate [? Cooze ?] Club\" that you started.",
            "That it was a complete misunderstanding.",
            "Happens all the time.",
            "In Act Four, another perspective on the whole thing from David Sedaris. But first, let\u0027s go to Pledge Central. Shirley Jahad.",
            "Hi, honey.",
            "I understand that we\u0027re having problems with the phones.",
            "So if you\u0027re having trouble getting through, and if you don\u0027t get through until the exact moment when our show ends, and you want some of the premia from this hour and the phones aren\u0027t working, ask for them and we\u0027ll give them to you.",
            "Here we go. Here\u0027s something we haven\u0027t played yet. Again, we have special premia. One is the Un-Cabaret CD. One is the Shut Up, Little Man CD, which maybe I\u0027ll just play a little clip of that real fast. It\u0027s a very odd CD-- these two guys who would fight all the time. And it\u0027s sort of audio verite recorded by their neighbors next door as these two men would scream at each other. Here we go.",
            "Now, I should say the music in there is actually from our little mix that we did on the show. And this is one of those things that it\u0027s hard to get a sense of just in a brief little clip. Another thing we\u0027re giving away is recent work by beloved NPR commentator David Sedaris. And that includes work that he\u0027s done here on Your Radio Playhouse, that is, some of the radio plays he\u0027s done with his sister, Amy, and other actors. And this piece, this half-hour hitchhiking story that he told. Here\u0027s one little brief, brief episode from that story.",
            "Anyway, again, the number if you want this very odd collection of stories from David Sedaris, 832-3160. The collection includes the story that we\u0027re going to hear at the end of this evening\u0027s show.",
            "We put a lot of effort into this show to bring you unusual stories that you will not hear anywhere else. And we want your support. We want your support. And we were trying to find premia that you would enjoy and could get nowhere else. So please, please call. Please call and join our fun little party here. And I guess that\u0027s it. 832-3160.",
            "What do you remember of it?",
            "When he describes you during that period, he felt like you had a kind of David Koresh-like power over others."

            "Perhaps Randy feels sorry for chrome-dome Annette. Maybe that\u0027s why he was seen twice in her company in a single five-day period. Seen standing together in the parking lot of the Burger Tabernacle-- her home away from home-- and seen huddled together, laughing on the escalator of the Crabtree Valley Mall. Annette, my supposed best friend, who secretly wanted and coveted everything I owned. Is everyone on earth as two-faced as Annette Kelper? Is everyone as cruel as Randy Sykes? I think not.",
            "Most of you, the loved ones I left behind, are simple, devoted people. I urge you now to take a look around the room. Are Randy Sykes and Annette sitting in the audience? Are they shifting uncomfortably in the pew, shielding their faces with the 8 and 1/2 by 11 photograph of me I had reproduced to serve as a memento of this occasion?",
            "Eileen, read this part real fast before they have a chance to leave. Randy Sykes\u0027 drip is the size of my little finger, and that\u0027s when it\u0027s hard. And I\u0027m not counting the nail-- just the finger. He had sex two times with a boy at Camp Ticonderoga when he was in junior high school. Maybe that explains why he loves it with somebody sticks their finger up his [? couvade. ?] He used to beg me to do that, but I refused. I said, \"No way, Randy.\" He used to do it to himself all the time. That\u0027s why I never held hands with him. His hands stink.",
            "He secretly thinks he looks like Marlon Brando, but take a good look. A young Marlin Perkins is more like it. Maybe that\u0027s what he sees in Annette Kelper. He\u0027s an animal lover. She used to come to my house crying. Her breath smelled a mile off, like her uncle\u0027s drip. She said he forced her, but that\u0027s a lie, because you don\u0027t force whores. And that\u0027s what she is, a whore.",
            "Annette and Randy deserve each other. Drip-Breath and Stinky-Finger, riding up and down the escalator at Crabtree Valley, up and down, up and down. Fancy little shuck-cutlets. Look at them. Take a good, hard look at them. It\u0027s their fault I\u0027m dead. They are to blame.",
            "I urge you now to take those paperweights and stone them. Release your anger. The Bible says it\u0027s all right to cast the first stone if someone dead is telling you do it. And I\u0027m telling you now. Pretend the paperweights are stones and cast them upon the guilty. I put aside my savings to pay for the damages to the walls and windows. It\u0027s money I was saving for my wedding, and there\u0027s plenty of it. So throw. Hurt them the way they hurt me. Kill them! Nobody will hold you responsible. Kill them!",
            "Eileen, I\u0027m going to allow a few minutes here because it might take a while for certain people to get into the swing of it. Pop in the cassette marked \"Stoning,\" and wait until both Randy and Annette are lifeless. Wait until everyone is finished with their paperweights. And then I want you to hand the microphone over to my mother. Watch the way she trembles and stutters, and remember every gesture as if you were me.",
            "Dear friends and family, by the time you receive this letter, I will be dead. Those of you attending this service are sitting quietly holding a beautiful paperweight, a gift from the collection which, in life, had been my pride and joy. You turn the paperweight over in your hands, look deep inside at the object embedded in the glass, be it a rose or a scorpion, whatever. And through your tears, you ask, what is death like?",
            "By this time, I certainly know the answer to that question, but I\u0027m unable to give details. Know only that I will one day meet you upon the grassy plains of heaven where, with the exception of Randy Sykes and Annette Kelper, I will be tickled to embrace you and catch up on all the news.",
            "If my instructions were followed the way I wanted them to be-- see attached instruction envelope number one-- this letter is being read to you from the pulpit of the Simple Shepherd Church of Christ by my best friend, Eileen Mickey-- hi, Eileen-- who is wearing the long-sleeve Lisa Montino designer dress I left behind that always looked so good on me.",
            "Eileen, I hope you either lost some weight or took it out some on the sides, or you\u0027re not going to be able to breathe. Also remember, it needs to be dry cleaned. I know how you and your family love to skimp. But please, don\u0027t listen to what anyone says about Woolite. Dry clean.",
            "Most of you are probably wondering why I did it. You\u0027re whispering, \"Why, Lord? Why take Trish Moody? Trish was a ray of bright sunshine, always so up and perky and full of love. Pretty, too. Just as smart and sweet and pretty as they come.\"",
            "You\u0027re probably shaking your heads and thinking there\u0027s plenty of people a lot worse than Trish Moody. There\u0027s her former excuse for a boyfriend, Randy Sykes, for example. The boyfriend who, after Trish accidentally backed her car over his dog, practically beat her senseless. He beat her with words, but still, it might as well have been with his fists. He struck her again and again with words and names such as \"manipulative,\" \"jealous,\" \"childish,\" and others I wouldn\u0027t justify in print. The dog\u0027s death was a tragic accident, but perhaps also a blessing in disguise, as Randy tended to spend entirely too much time with it.",
            "What did Trish\u0027s mother say when her daughter, heartbroken over her breakup with Randy, came to her in search of love and understanding? If you\u0027re looking for sympathy, you can find it between \"sob story\" and \"syphilis\" in the dictionary. Perhaps my mother can live with slogans such as this. I know I can\u0027t.",
            "Neither can I live surrounded by friends such as Annette Kelper. Poor, chubby Annette Kelper, who desperately tries to pretend that nobody notices the fact that she\u0027s balding on top of her head. That\u0027s right. Look closely. Balding, just like a man."
