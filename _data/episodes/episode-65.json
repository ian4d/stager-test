Act Two, The World\u0027s Most Perfect Pneumatic Vacuum, in which our own Sarah Vowell arm wrestles with Ian Brown of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation over what it means to be an American and what it means to be a Canadian and if they are any different at all. Act Three, Outing. An expose on the pro-Canadian bias and Peter Jennings\u0027 nightly newscast for ABC, and more. Act Four, Who\u0027s Canadian? Two siblings separated, not at birth.

        "Brandon, in one show, plays in a charity hockey tournament with guest stars Cam Neely and Ron Duguay.",
        "Could someone please tell me who plays hockey in Los Angeles? The fact is that in real life, Priestley used to play center on a Division II hockey team where his teammate was Michael J. Fox. It\u0027s all connected.",
        "Then there was the show that starts out with an extreme close-up shot of a maple leaf insignia on the back of Brandon\u0027s shirt for, like, two minutes before Brandon walks away. The show basically starts out displaying the Canadian flag. I mean, aren\u0027t there FCC laws against this kind of thing?",
        "Another show featured a Ukrainian dance troupe, which is a stealth reference to Canada where such dance troupes are well known. Alex Trebek, former host of the Canadian show Stars on Ice and current host of Jeopardy!, which makes unwarranted reference to Canada more often than can be explained statistically, himself stars in a Jeopardy! dream sequence on 90210.",
        "Most recently, during a school talent show, Donna and Steve recreate a scene reminiscent of the Nelson Eddy- Jeanette MacDonald operetta-based movies of the \u002730s and \u002740s, in this case, featuring a Canadian Mountie and his gal singing \"Royal Canadian Love Affair.\" A great cultural reference for Canadians. I mean, at least give the American audience a clue as to what you\u0027re talking about by mentioning Dudley Do-Right or something.",
        "Adding insult to injury, because of hockey playoffs, and unlike every other American-made entertainment product, 90210 is often seen on Monday night in Canada, two days before the Wednesday broadcast in the United States. Canadian friends and fellow viewers of the show have informed me that hoards of Canadians cheer as these Canadian references to the revolution are broadcast over the American airwaves. How did we ever reach this point?",
        "Canadian references start to show up in 90210 in various guises. One episode sees Steve, Brandon, and Joe meeting some girls from Canada. And Jason\u0027s character, Brandon Walsh, unnecessarily comments on where they are from, Parry Sound, home of Hall of Fame hockey player Bobby Orr. Who even remembers who Bobby Orr is, much less where he was born? Brandon\u0027s later comment as he ogles the girls from afar is, \"O, Canada.\" When their girlfriends get jealous, Brandon is like, we just got totally hosed, eh?",
        "In one episode, for no reason whatsoever, Brandon refers to Manitoba. In the season finale, Steve makes the throwaway statement that his American actress mother is doing theater in Toronto. In yet another, Kathleen Robertson\u0027s character, Clare Arnold, called Steve a hoser. Clare is often heard gratuitously attempting to speak mangled French, like the time when she wanted to say, \"let the best man win.\" In French, \"que le meilleur gagne,\" which instead came out \"culla mello gong,\" in what I can only imagine is a shout-out to Quebec or something."

        "Well, even before the 20th century-- I was thinking about this when I was looking at this Canadian history book over the weekend-- and how almost embarrassingly gradual your path to independence seemed, to me, And I was wondering how in the world you could teach schoolchildren about this really complicated, subtle history in a way that would be halfway inspiring.",
        "The American flag debate?",
        "And what year was that?",
        "Fairly late.",
        "Which was also fairly late, it seems to me.",
        "I was thinking about this the other day. And I was engaged in a little us-versus-them debate with a Canadian friend. And I was talking about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and words and phrases like \"We, the people\" and \"life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,\" and how these things have had this enormous bearing on me, certainly as a writer, and being able to say what I think, and that it\u0027s codified within these governmental structures. And at one point, I just said, \"what\u0027s your sound bite?\" And he didn\u0027t have one. Is there a sound bite of Canadian-ness?",
        "\"A few acres of snow.\" Doesn\u0027t that just make you want to go out and change the world?",
        "But I\u0027m from Montana. We have that there too.",
        "Well, you\u0027re right, except the very idea of America is that even though tons of people have been there, done that, the idea of America is that you don\u0027t care. You just keep going.",
        "Like most Americans, I don\u0027t particularly care about Canada. But every week, I spend three solid hours thinking about goings-on in Moose Jaw and Manitoba. The reason is this. Even though I don\u0027t care about Canada, I do care about radio, passionately. And my favorite radio program-- aside from this one, of course-- is Sunday Morning. And the most moving segment of the show is usually host Ian Brown\u0027s personal essay at the end.",
        "Oh, thanks for bringing that up.",
        "Well, we have to take the agony with the ecstasy.",
        "Well, that\u0027s interesting for someone who yaks for a living to say.",
        "That\u0027s right. Well, we won\u0027t hold that against you.",
        "One week it\u0027s about hockey versus basketball, the next about his opposition to a separate Quebec. But what it\u0027s really about is the idea of nation. Listening to him ask questions of his country and his place in it, I get to ask those questions of mine. It\u0027s not something we tend to dwell on in American broadcasting. But Brown says that in Canada, it happens all the time. And because America\u0027s cultural presence is so huge and so near, Canadian self-reflection must, by definition, involve thinking about living next door to such a noisy neighbor.",
        "Can you recall one of those particular moments where you felt like an alien or you felt like an American did or said something that seemed completely foreign to you?",
        "You don\u0027t have jerks in Canada?",
        "Well, it seems like the things that you\u0027ve been bringing up-- these differences-- are rather confined to the sphere of minutiae. I mean, are the two cultures really separate? Can you separate them?",
        "But besides these political differences, how-- for instance, we\u0027ve been having these conversations around here in planning this show where someone says, Neil Young-- Canadian. Everyone says, he\u0027s Canadian? Or Mike Myers or Pamela Anderson Lee. You know, the blond bimbo babe of all time-- Canadian.",
        "Canadian, yeah. It always ends the same way. And it seems like despite these small, little differences, or even huge political ones, it\u0027s really hard to tell an American and a Canadian apart.",
        "Yeah, but he wrote my favorite song, \"Keep on Rockin\u0027 in the Free World,\" which is, to me, maybe one of the most American songs. It has this incredible beat, it rocks, it\u0027s a condemnation specifically of the Bush administration, but it\u0027s also about hope and imagination as well as Styrofoam and the ozone layer. To me, it\u0027s an American song.",
        "OK, what about Pamela Anderson Lee, then?",
        "They say that?",
        "You only want the serious people? You only want to claim Neil Young?",
        "So when you\u0027re here without the protection of the border--",
        "And is the plastic surgery-- is it that part of her is now physically American?",
        "I know that you\u0027re running out of time. If not, you\u0027re out of time on your end. But I just want to ask before we end, what was your favorite thing about being a Canadian living in the US when you did?",
        "Do we amuse you?",
        "--are you swallowed?"

There\u0027s a sense of betrayal, but there\u0027s also just a sense of sadness and a realization that that\u0027s the reality of the world and the economy that we live in. And also, maybe weariness, almost, when another one goes.",
        "You are a bum.",
        "I think only on a personal level. I don\u0027t think in any of those sort of philosophical ways. I think I would feel different, though, if you told me that you were deciding to become an American citizen. But I think until now, I\u0027ve always felt like you\u0027re just living there and working there and eventually, you\u0027ll come back.",
        "Yeah. Or it\u0027s not even that clear, but it\u0027s still that you belong here somehow. And even though you don\u0027t come back very much, somehow you\u0027re still Canadian.",

        "Yeah, I think that\u0027s really a struggle for Canadians. And in some way, I think it\u0027s that struggle that, ironically, defines what the answer is. I think in some ways, the answer is that a Canadian is someone who struggles to figure out what is to be Canadian and not American. And all of those things, it\u0027s really hard to make a pavilion about. There\u0027s that eternal problem of how do you make a Canadian knight? How do you make a Canadian pavilion? And you kind of have maple syrup, and that\u0027s the end of it. And we don\u0027t have a nice national dress and national food. And we have, well, the beaver, and not too much else.",
        "It\u0027s interesting because I talk about you often when I talk to people. And I talk about you as being my brother who has gone off and lived in the United States. And I talk about you with a great deal of pride. And people certainly respond by being very impressed. But there\u0027s that sense in which-- so I was thinking, if you came here, you would be a celebrity in the sense that you\u0027re my brother who lives in the United States and you live this highly sophisticated life and you live in New York City and everyone\u0027s deeply impressed by this.",
        "But you wouldn\u0027t be of us. I think the perception would be very different if you had done the same thing over the last 10 years in London, England. I think you would be perceived as being more Canadian still than having gone to the United States for 10 years. I suspect it might even be true if you had gone to another European country, that you would still be perceived as being more Canadian than you would be perceived now.",

And it\u0027s not even her ideas about the place or her sense of patriotism. It\u0027s more the way that she lives in Canada, connected to her small community and her neighbors and the natural world around her, working at her church and in her kitchen and in her garden. That, to me, is a Canadian life. And from my studio apartment in New York, her life in Winnipeg seems very far away. And I think to her, I seem far away, too.",

        "Well, you\u0027ve struck on quite an important point there. It often isn\u0027t inspiring because it is so gradual. We\u0027ve been talking about the constitution in this country. To my direct knowledge-- I\u0027ve been following it since I was about-- well, the flag debate. I was about 11, I guess.",
        "No, the Canadian flag debate, when we finally got a flag of our own.",
        "Oh, that was 1965.",
        "Oh yeah, exactly, 100 years after the Confederation.",
        "Which was also fairly late. Yeah, sure. We\u0027re gradualists. We don\u0027t like to do anything extreme. And Margaret Atwood says that this is because it\u0027s so cold here and that you have to be so careful. You\u0027d like to take your clothes off and go running outside, but it\u0027s so cold most of the time that you keep at least some of your clothes on, even though you\u0027re pretending to be naked.",
        "Well, I always liked \"the True North, strong and free\" myself. That\u0027s always appealed to me. And it\u0027s probably imported from somewhere. But that\u0027s always the one I like. And I think it\u0027s Voltaire\u0027s description of \"a few acres of snow.\" I think he said that. I always liked that image.",
        "No, what it does is it reminds you that this country-- far more than yours-- is a physical country. You folks have all these ideas-- or so-called ideas-- Manifest Destiny, the pursuit of happiness-- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But they\u0027re ideas. And physically, the country doesn\u0027t really exist. I was always amazed that more Americans aren\u0027t interested in politics down there. Your voting participation rate is absolutely abysmal. And I think it\u0027s because people can\u0027t conceive of the country in any way. It\u0027s like an amassing together of individualisms.",
        "But after a while, there\u0027s so many individualisms that there\u0027s nothing collective there. In some ways, Canada has exactly the opposite problem, that we\u0027ve needed to be collective. And for so long, it\u0027s been impossible to be an individualist and still be a Canadian. But it has to do with how youthful the country is.",
        "I\u0027ve been in the wilderness quite a bit in both Canada and the United States. And I always notice this incredible difference. In Canada, if I go-- I don\u0027t know-- 100 hundred miles north of Winnipeg, there are places where you go out into the bush, you go out into the wilderness, and you really do have this sense that you may very well be the first person to be standing there. That this is really virgin territory and you\u0027re standing there. And that\u0027s an incredible feeling, because--",
        "But you don\u0027t have it the same way. I\u0027ve been in Montana. I\u0027ve been on the top of the Teton Mountains and all the rest. And you get up there, and the sensation you have in the American wilderness is, well, this is incredible because I\u0027m standing where so many people have gone before. Lewis and Clark were here, blah, blah, blah, all these people. And I\u0027m standing in their footsteps, and that is the great thing. Whereas in Canada, it\u0027s the exact opposite. No one was here. I\u0027m the first person.",
        "And it has real consequences. In America, the great thing you have is your history and your tradition. The hard thing in America these days it seems to me looking at it from afar, is that it\u0027s so hard to think, well, I can do something new. We can break out of the box we\u0027re in. Look at something like campaign reform. Nobody thinks you can ever fix it, so why the heck try? Whereas in Canada, we have exactly the opposite problem. We all think, well, I couldn\u0027t possibly do this because no one\u0027s ever been here or done this before. It really is like the invert of--",
        "Yeah, but you\u0027ve got to be more and more outlandish, it seems to us. The fact that Jerry Springer comes from your country is--",
        "Well, I\u0027m sorry, but how does he fit into Manifest Destiny? If that\u0027s the end result of it--",
        "Well, that\u0027s what makes your country so interesting. And I think that\u0027s why people stereotype Canada and say it\u0027s boring. They think there is no individual spirit here. Wrongly, of course, but they do think that. And we think all you\u0027ve got is yakking.",
        "Admittedly. Well, I have an American wife, remember.",
        "No, but the Canadians hold it against her. She often complains. She says there is a distinct anti-American feeling here. And she\u0027s a lovely person, and people like her. But she says people are always saying at parties, oh, that\u0027s so American, when someone talks about somebody being crass or somebody being particularly ambitious or particularly in your face. They say, oh, that\u0027s so American. Then they remember she\u0027s American and they say, oh, sorry, Johanna, not you. You\u0027re different.",
        "And she thinks it\u0027s quite widespread. And I will say that as a Canadian, I never noticed anything like that down in America. It is a very, very, very tolerant place until you stand up and say, well, Canadians are different. And then they say, oh, no you\u0027re not. You\u0027re exactly the same. You like Disney too, don\u0027t you? And we say, well, yeah we do, but not all the time.",
        "I was walking along the boardwalk of Manhattan Beach in California. Manhattan Beach is right on the water, and there\u0027s this beautiful-- I was walking along, and I was having an argument with my wife. Not a loud argument, but an argument. A debate, I guess you could call it. And we were debating the merits of speaking in front of our children-- in front of my daughter-- and having discussions as if she wasn\u0027t there.",
        "And as we were walking along, some guy on rollerblades went by and looked at us. And then he turned around, he came back up to me, and he said, \"Man, I want to tell you, man, it, like, really lays some heavy lumber\"-- I don\u0027t think he said lumber, but-- \"it lays some heavy groove on your kids, man, to be fighting in front of them.\" And I said, \"Well, first of all, we weren\u0027t fighting. We were having a debate. And B, it\u0027s none of your business. Get out of my face.\" That would never happen.",
        "It\u0027s not jerks. I mean, he probably had a point. But no Canadian that I have ever encountered would ever deign to even come close to telling you how-- especially publicly. Especially publicly.",
        "I understand your question, and there are so many similarities that many Canadians ask much the same question. We live in a global world, it\u0027s a global economy, we\u0027re all the same, nationalism is for jerks. But civically, we\u0027re very different. We have a parliamentary democracy here. There are at least two, and possibly more, parties involved in every single debate. Everything is voted on.",
        "We elect our representatives directly to the House of Commons. Our prime minister is chosen from amongst them, generally speaking. That\u0027s not the case in America. You have this complicated checks and balances system, which seems to us to have no direct representation at all. And judging from the fractions in which you vote, a lot of Americans feel the same way, too. Whereas in Canada, voter participation is pretty high.",
        "They can\u0027t believe she\u0027s Canadian?",
        "I think we\u0027ve developed the same attitudes that, say, the Pakistanis have towards India or, say, the border the Poles have to Russia. American culture somehow seizes you. But at the same time, we\u0027re not part of American culture. In fact, for years, Canadians have defined themselves-- or many Canadians have defined themselves-- as being, we\u0027re Canadian because we\u0027re not American. It\u0027s not a very good definition, but it\u0027s certainly one that a lot of people--",
        "Well, it depends how you measure them, though. Neil Armstrong is a great-- Neil Armstrong. He was American, right? He\u0027s the first guy who ever-- and he\u0027s American. It\u0027s incredible! No, Neil Young-- he\u0027s a brilliant songwriter and musician, so he hits the universal in that way.",
        "Well, that\u0027s, I think, you defining the song. It\u0027s not Neil defining the song. One of my favorite songs of his begins, \"There is a town in North Ontario.\" I\u0027d say that\u0027s the emblematic Neil Young song. And to me, he\u0027s hugely Canadian. Not only is he hugely Canadian because he writes the songs he does, because so many of them have a northern, isolated feel to them, because they are about strong emotion expressed quietly and expressed in a quiet vessel but also because his dad was a sportswriter for The Globe and Mail who everybody read. So I can\u0027t separate him out.",
        "Well, as I say, we\u0027re talking about the universal here, aren\u0027t we? You know what they say. If you want to sell something to everybody, make sure it has a large bust line. So she feels that--",
        "Marketers sometimes say that. What is she? She\u0027s like the most universally pneumatic vacuum in the world. So it\u0027s true. That doesn\u0027t feel particularly Canadian. And I understand why. But she\u0027s not a serious example. She\u0027s a woman--",
        "I only want to talk about the ones that you can actually measure on a real basis. I don\u0027t know what Pamela Lee was before she was inflated. But I\u0027d be willing to say the old, uninflated Pamela Lee, before she became almost the quintessential Hollywood bombshell, I\u0027ll bet you could find Canadian stuff about her. I don\u0027t know. It would be an interesting story. That\u0027s for sure.",
        "That is definitely American. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That part of Pamela Lee is as American as American goes.",
        "Americans. Americans. Because I work as a writer. And in Canada, one of the biggest parts of the job is to draw people out, to make them comfortable, to get them talking, to get them to realize that it\u0027s just a conversation, that they can be themselves. Americans are much less conscious of themselves. They have much less self-consciousness. They\u0027re much more themselves in the world. And damn it if you don\u0027t like it. I\u0027m an American. I\u0027m an individual.",
        "And so you get all this incredible unconscious behavior happening right in front you. It\u0027s like having your own little stage show wherever you go. There\u0027s always some entertainment because there\u0027s always people being themselves. You don\u0027t get that as much in Canada. And I found it--",
        "No, I don\u0027t mean in a condescending way. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not of it, but I love having a seat ringside.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "It\u0027s flipped around. You\u0027re always slightly afraid and slightly amazed and slightly aware that you\u0027re swirling in some huge vortex that might just suck you down. At the same time, I should say that-- and I don\u0027t know whether this is a widely shared view-- but one of the reasons why Canadians are so obsessed with America is that it is such an energetic culture. It\u0027s so important in the world. It is the great empire of the 20th century-- has been. And you can\u0027t avoid that."

        "It goes without saying that Peter Jennings is a mole, a spy, a shill, a confederate for Canada. All you have to do is watch his program, as I did one week.",
        "He\u0027s not liberal or conservative. Jennings just seems to have it in for the American government. Sometimes his reference is implied, even bizarre.",
        "What are we being told by this story? It\u0027s not easy to parse, but it\u0027s either about an innocent Canadian blinded by our defense obsession or the superior maturity of Canada for not being directly involved in the two superpowers\u0027 now admittedly absurd arms race. So there\u0027s no question about where Peter\u0027s loyalties lie. In fact, Peter wants to come out of the Canadian closet. His Freudian slips cry out.",
        "Reckon you mean when you come back oot, don\u0027t you, stranger? Do you hear how Peter strains to split the difference between the Canadian oot and the American out? Listen again.",
        "You\u0027ll notice that Peter\u0027s always about to come back from somewhere.",
        "Or he\u0027s heading out.",
        "Or he\u0027s inviting us somewhere.",
        "See, Peter\u0027s on a journey to someplace. If you watch his show long enough, it\u0027s obvious. The very structure of the show has a sense that we\u0027re going somewhere-- a place, a mythical place. Every program has this feeling of zigzagging en route to some ultimate destination. And you know where he wants to take us? Canada. That\u0027s right, Canada.",
        "But actually, after you\u0027ve watched World News Tonight long enough, you realize that this is not a journey to the real Canada but to the platonic ideal of Canadian-ness. Stay with me here. See, Peter\u0027s news is noticeably different from Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw\u0027s. Tom and Dan see a hostile world erupting with bad news everywhere, full of murder and mayhem, macho and dismal, hell in a hand basket, fire and brimstone stuff. You know, very puritanical, very American in outlook.",
        "Dan\u0027s all clenched jaws, garretted coat and tie, a human time bomb waiting to explode. Peter\u0027s just kicking back. He could be wearing a smoking jacket and, during the commercial, sipping a mild single-malt Scotch. Once Peter gets past ridiculing the American government, it\u0027s odd, but suddenly, the news he\u0027s reading is uncannily bright. Cheerful and good news. Healing news. Soothing news. Ecumenical news. Canadian news.",
        "More comfortable dentistry. My, that is good news. But wait.",
        "No more food poisoning. Terrific.",
        "To understand the real meaning of this Canadian news, one has to read past the literal facts embedded in each statement and get to the level on which television actually speaks to us-- emotion. To really feel it, you have to merge the ads and the news into one seamless half hour of Peterphoria. You have to step a bit further back from the screen, lie down on a down comforter, and let it wash over you, like reading Finnegans Wake.",
        "And if you do this, suddenly the hidden meaning becomes instantaneously clear and weirdly repetitive. The message is, surrender. Your time is over. My fellow Americans, a great nation is being asked to lie down and give it up. Peter\u0027s meaning is clear. Even superpowers must age and yield and settle down. One ad that airs a couple of times every show is for SunAmerica. Sun, as in setting sun.",
        "Retire. No commercial break passes without the word reverberating through the screen. But of course, Peter and his fellow travelers try to keep this message lively and vibrant.",
        "It\u0027s OK, see? Over time though, the message goes even further than that. Why just retire? Even the musical score begins to hint at the next logical option.",
        "I don\u0027t think I\u0027m stretching here. You heard it yourself. The message is, let it go. Cross all the way over to the other side. The entire half hour is a kind of advertisement for dark eternity.",
        "This is cotton? Honey, this is a shroud. Just when is it that you stop living and look around? We\u0027re dying here. See how obvious it is once you take off your rose-colored glasses and see what\u0027s in front of your face? Once you tune in at this level-- the real level-- each commercial gets increasingly more frightening.",
        "Someplace safe and secure. Someplace like America, but without all those tense Dan Rather troubles. Someplace like Canada. And isn\u0027t that how Americans have always thought of Canada? It\u0027s like America, only without any jazz. Tranquil and safe and secure and endless, like death. If only Peter can take us to that place where we no longer have any anxiety. If only Peter can remove the sting. If only Peter can end the fear. If only.",
        "Uh huh. Take us out, Peter. Tell us what the story is all aboot."

Act Two, The World\u0027s Most Perfect Pneumatic Vacuum, in which our own Sarah Vowell arm wrestles with Ian Brown of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation over what it means to be an American and what it means to be a Canadian and if they are any different at all. Act Three, Outing. An expose on the pro-Canadian bias and Peter Jennings\u0027 nightly newscast for ABC, and more. Act Four, Who\u0027s Canadian? Two siblings separated, not at birth. One gone to live in Winnipeg, one gone to live in Manhattan. Their stories. Stay with us.",

            "Borje Salming. Hockey player. Not Canadian. Daryl Sittler? Yes, Canadian. Ira, I have never been to a hockey game in my entire life. How do these things enter my brain?",
            "My tactics were to adopt a certain kind of world-weary, jaded, anxious neuroticism. And it was taken on as a cosmetic mantle at the beginning until such time as you simply can\u0027t pull the mask off your face. Oh my god, it\u0027s stuck. There you are years later, a jaded, affectless, neurotic, disenchanted, sad person. But that\u0027s fine.",
            "I don\u0027t even think so, you know? I just think it comes in off the breeze or in a cold front. And I know. I just know in my heart who\u0027s Canadian.",
            "It\u0027s so strange. And of course, the arm on your space shuttle.",
            "The arm on your space shuttle for making interstellar repairs.",
            "The American space shuttle with its Canadian-built arm. Never any other way, as in \"The American space shuttle with its Canadian-built arm blew up today.\"",
            "No, well, I was actually here at the time, but the Canadian-built arm gets a lot of airplay. Not down here, huh? In fact, if you were to ask most Canadians, \"What do you think the space shuttle is for?\" they\u0027d say, \"Oh, to go up and move stuff around in space with an arm.\"",
            "Oh, well, your heart does a little bit of a-- a certain special Canadian\u0027s chamber opens up and enfolds that name and you keep it. Or if you mention a famous Canadian in conversation to a Canadian without acknowledging it, there\u0027s a vague flicker over their eyes like the shadow of an angel\u0027s wing passing, and then the conversation will go on and on. And then, just as an afterthought, they\u0027ll say, well, you know, he\u0027s Canadian, by the way. Of course, it\u0027s all you\u0027ve been waiting to say the entire conversation.",
            "If a non-Canadian says to you, and you are a Canadian. But you can do it with a Canadian too.",
            "Monty Hall.",
            "Why, just the other day when we were talking about what was in your purse. Remember, I asked you? And I would be compelled by DNA--",
            "Not even at some point, Ira. Let\u0027s try it. Go on, you start.",
            "They\u0027re Canadian. That\u0027s how I do it. I don\u0027t even wait. I don\u0027t even wait. Bachman-Turner Overdrive. They\u0027re Canadian. And then I\u0027ll tell you, \"Taking Care of Business,\" they wrote that. They\u0027re Canadian. I don\u0027t even bother waiting. Very effective. And it always also begs the question, which is, oh, are you Canadian?",
            "No. No, I would never consciously not bring it up. I would occasionally consciously bring it up because it would-- amazingly enough-- make me more exotic. Because let\u0027s face it, in New York City, I\u0027m a Jewish guy with dark hair who works in publishing with a gift for the gab. I meet myself coming and going 12 to 14 times an hour. So occasionally, I\u0027ll need that little bit of spice. And what\u0027s more spicy than being Canadian? I ask you.",
            "Well, of course they\u0027d ask that. It\u0027s a little unbalanced if one wasn\u0027t. Don\u0027t you think that would be somewhat strange behavior?",
            "Oh, yeah. I\u0027m somewhat familiar with that game. So can you imagine what the double triumph is if someone\u0027s a Canadian Jew? Lorne Greene. You fairly cannot imagine anyone more heroic than Lorne Greene. He\u0027s a Canadian.",
            "Absolutely. He\u0027s Canadian, and Jewish too.",
            "And imagine how crestfallen everybody was when they found out that Andrea Martin of Second City TV is not just not Jewish, she\u0027s Armenian. But she\u0027s from Maine. She just lived in Canada. And then everybody shrugs and says, well, Armenians, they\u0027re very similar. And Maine, it\u0027s very close. And she lived here for so long.",
            "When I meet them here?",
            "Yes, I worry that they\u0027re going to be really literal and take everything that I say totally seriously-- even the throwaway remarks-- and then I\u0027m going to have to backtrack and explain myself. I worry that they\u0027re going to blow my cover.",
            "As a Canadian masquerading as an urban sophisticate.",
            "They would suddenly say, \"You\u0027re not a sophisticated New Yorker. You\u0027re just nothing but a tobogganing Canadian.\" And then I always feel that I have to turn in my liquor supply and my books and return home. And then, in fact, all the quips that I made all over the years turn out to actually have been made up by someone else, even though I didn\u0027t know it.",
            "That? Yes.",
            "Briefly. Briefly. And then, another kind of reserve kicks in. And one thinks, well, everybody\u0027s got to come from somewhere, don\u0027t they? And, in fact, it\u0027s a little bit even more vindicating because you have that whole sort of, not bad for a boy from Canada, sort of feeling.",
            "All the time. Everything. And that, to me, is chemical. You know, the easy ones. Glenn Ford, Kate Nelligan, Hume Cronyn, Cowboy Junkies, Monty Hall--",
            "There was an adorable-- I remember going down to the deli or something one night when I was a freshman in college and looking into the dairy case and seeing what you call those individually wrapped slices of processed cheese food.",
            "Yes. And we call it Canadian cheese. And I, of course, thought, oh, isn\u0027t that cute. They\u0027re trying to take credit for Canadian cheese. And now, of course, my feeling is that we should be calling it American cheese, and you guys should be calling it Canadian cheese. It seems like something one should be throwing the blame right across the 49th parallel, whatever side you\u0027re on. But I thought, oh, that\u0027s adorable.",
            "Canadian singles, yes.",
            "Doesn\u0027t it just?",
            "They all work in a coffeehouse in Guelph, Ontario. Some of them are majoring in animal husbandry.",

            "Which was also fairly late, it seems to me.",
            "I was thinking about this the other day. And I was engaged in a little us-versus-them debate with a Canadian friend. And I was talking about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and words and phrases like \"We, the people\" and \"life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,\" and how these things have had this enormous bearing on me, certainly as a writer, and being able to say what I think, and that it\u0027s codified within these governmental structures. And at one point, I just said, \"what\u0027s your sound bite?\" And he didn\u0027t have one. Is there a sound bite of Canadian-ness?",
            "\"A few acres of snow.\" Doesn\u0027t that just make you want to go out and change the world?",
            "But I\u0027m from Montana. We have that there too.",
            "Well, you\u0027re right, except the very idea of America is that even though tons of people have been there, done that, the idea of America is that you don\u0027t care. You just keep going.",
            "Like most Americans, I don\u0027t particularly care about Canada. But every week, I spend three solid hours thinking about goings-on in Moose Jaw and Manitoba. The reason is this. Even though I don\u0027t care about Canada, I do care about radio, passionately. And my favorite radio program-- aside from this one, of course-- is Sunday Morning. And the most moving segment of the show is usually host Ian Brown\u0027s personal essay at the end.",
            "Oh, thanks for bringing that up.",
            "Well, we have to take the agony with the ecstasy.",
            "Well, that\u0027s interesting for someone who yaks for a living to say.",
            "That\u0027s right. Well, we won\u0027t hold that against you.",
            "One week it\u0027s about hockey versus basketball, the next about his opposition to a separate Quebec. But what it\u0027s really about is the idea of nation. Listening to him ask questions of his country and his place in it, I get to ask those questions of mine. It\u0027s not something we tend to dwell on in American broadcasting. But Brown says that in Canada, it happens all the time. And because America\u0027s cultural presence is so huge and so near, Canadian self-reflection must, by definition, involve thinking about living next door to such a noisy neighbor.",
            "Can you recall one of those particular moments where you felt like an alien or you felt like an American did or said something that seemed completely foreign to you?",
            "You don\u0027t have jerks in Canada?",
            "Well, it seems like the things that you\u0027ve been bringing up-- these differences-- are rather confined to the sphere of minutiae. I mean, are the two cultures really separate? Can you separate them?",
            "But besides these political differences, how-- for instance, we\u0027ve been having these conversations around here in planning this show where someone says, Neil Young-- Canadian. Everyone says, he\u0027s Canadian? Or Mike Myers or Pamela Anderson Lee. You know, the blond bimbo babe of all time-- Canadian.",
            "Canadian, yeah. It always ends the same way. And it seems like despite these small, little differences, or even huge political ones, it\u0027s really hard to tell an American and a Canadian apart.",
            "Yeah, but he wrote my favorite song, \"Keep on Rockin\u0027 in the Free World,\" which is, to me, maybe one of the most American songs. It has this incredible beat, it rocks, it\u0027s a condemnation specifically of the Bush administration, but it\u0027s also about hope and imagination as well as Styrofoam and the ozone layer. To me, it\u0027s an American song.",
            "OK, what about Pamela Anderson Lee, then?",
            "They say that?",
            "You only want the serious people? You only want to claim Neil Young?",
            "So when you\u0027re here without the protection of the border--",
            "And is the plastic surgery-- is it that part of her is now physically American?",
            "I know that you\u0027re running out of time. If not, you\u0027re out of time on your end. But I just want to ask before we end, what was your favorite thing about being a Canadian living in the US when you did?",
            "Do we amuse you?",
            "--are you swallowed?"

            "Well, you\u0027ve struck on quite an important point there. It often isn\u0027t inspiring because it is so gradual. We\u0027ve been talking about the constitution in this country. To my direct knowledge-- I\u0027ve been following it since I was about-- well, the flag debate. I was about 11, I guess.",
            "No, the Canadian flag debate, when we finally got a flag of our own.",
            "Oh, that was 1965.",
            "Oh yeah, exactly, 100 years after the Confederation.",
            "Which was also fairly late. Yeah, sure. We\u0027re gradualists. We don\u0027t like to do anything extreme. And Margaret Atwood says that this is because it\u0027s so cold here and that you have to be so careful. You\u0027d like to take your clothes off and go running outside, but it\u0027s so cold most of the time that you keep at least some of your clothes on, even though you\u0027re pretending to be naked.",
            "Well, I always liked \"the True North, strong and free\" myself. That\u0027s always appealed to me. And it\u0027s probably imported from somewhere. But that\u0027s always the one I like. And I think it\u0027s Voltaire\u0027s description of \"a few acres of snow.\" I think he said that. I always liked that image.",
            "No, what it does is it reminds you that this country-- far more than yours-- is a physical country. You folks have all these ideas-- or so-called ideas-- Manifest Destiny, the pursuit of happiness-- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But they\u0027re ideas. And physically, the country doesn\u0027t really exist. I was always amazed that more Americans aren\u0027t interested in politics down there. Your voting participation rate is absolutely abysmal. And I think it\u0027s because people can\u0027t conceive of the country in any way. It\u0027s like an amassing together of individualisms.",
            "But after a while, there\u0027s so many individualisms that there\u0027s nothing collective there. In some ways, Canada has exactly the opposite problem, that we\u0027ve needed to be collective. And for so long, it\u0027s been impossible to be an individualist and still be a Canadian. But it has to do with how youthful the country is.",
            "I\u0027ve been in the wilderness quite a bit in both Canada and the United States. And I always notice this incredible difference. In Canada, if I go-- I don\u0027t know-- 100 hundred miles north of Winnipeg, there are places where you go out into the bush, you go out into the wilderness, and you really do have this sense that you may very well be the first person to be standing there. That this is really virgin territory and you\u0027re standing there. And that\u0027s an incredible feeling, because--",
            "But you don\u0027t have it the same way. I\u0027ve been in Montana. I\u0027ve been on the top of the Teton Mountains and all the rest. And you get up there, and the sensation you have in the American wilderness is, well, this is incredible because I\u0027m standing where so many people have gone before. Lewis and Clark were here, blah, blah, blah, all these people. And I\u0027m standing in their footsteps, and that is the great thing. Whereas in Canada, it\u0027s the exact opposite. No one was here. I\u0027m the first person.",
            "And it has real consequences. In America, the great thing you have is your history and your tradition. The hard thing in America these days it seems to me looking at it from afar, is that it\u0027s so hard to think, well, I can do something new. We can break out of the box we\u0027re in. Look at something like campaign reform. Nobody thinks you can ever fix it, so why the heck try? Whereas in Canada, we have exactly the opposite problem. We all think, well, I couldn\u0027t possibly do this because no one\u0027s ever been here or done this before. It really is like the invert of--",
            "Yeah, but you\u0027ve got to be more and more outlandish, it seems to us. The fact that Jerry Springer comes from your country is--",
            "Well, I\u0027m sorry, but how does he fit into Manifest Destiny? If that\u0027s the end result of it--",
            "Well, that\u0027s what makes your country so interesting. And I think that\u0027s why people stereotype Canada and say it\u0027s boring. They think there is no individual spirit here. Wrongly, of course, but they do think that. And we think all you\u0027ve got is yakking.",
            "Admittedly. Well, I have an American wife, remember.",
            "No, but the Canadians hold it against her. She often complains. She says there is a distinct anti-American feeling here. And she\u0027s a lovely person, and people like her. But she says people are always saying at parties, oh, that\u0027s so American, when someone talks about somebody being crass or somebody being particularly ambitious or particularly in your face. They say, oh, that\u0027s so American. Then they remember she\u0027s American and they say, oh, sorry, Johanna, not you. You\u0027re different.",
            "And she thinks it\u0027s quite widespread. And I will say that as a Canadian, I never noticed anything like that down in America. It is a very, very, very tolerant place until you stand up and say, well, Canadians are different. And then they say, oh, no you\u0027re not. You\u0027re exactly the same. You like Disney too, don\u0027t you? And we say, well, yeah we do, but not all the time.",
            "I was walking along the boardwalk of Manhattan Beach in California. Manhattan Beach is right on the water, and there\u0027s this beautiful-- I was walking along, and I was having an argument with my wife. Not a loud argument, but an argument. A debate, I guess you could call it. And we were debating the merits of speaking in front of our children-- in front of my daughter-- and having discussions as if she wasn\u0027t there.",
            "And as we were walking along, some guy on rollerblades went by and looked at us. And then he turned around, he came back up to me, and he said, \"Man, I want to tell you, man, it, like, really lays some heavy lumber\"-- I don\u0027t think he said lumber, but-- \"it lays some heavy groove on your kids, man, to be fighting in front of them.\" And I said, \"Well, first of all, we weren\u0027t fighting. We were having a debate. And B, it\u0027s none of your business. Get out of my face.\" That would never happen.",
            "It\u0027s not jerks. I mean, he probably had a point. But no Canadian that I have ever encountered would ever deign to even come close to telling you how-- especially publicly. Especially publicly.",
            "I understand your question, and there are so many similarities that many Canadians ask much the same question. We live in a global world, it\u0027s a global economy, we\u0027re all the same, nationalism is for jerks. But civically, we\u0027re very different. We have a parliamentary democracy here. There are at least two, and possibly more, parties involved in every single debate. Everything is voted on.",
            "We elect our representatives directly to the House of Commons. Our prime minister is chosen from amongst them, generally speaking. That\u0027s not the case in America. You have this complicated checks and balances system, which seems to us to have no direct representation at all. And judging from the fractions in which you vote, a lot of Americans feel the same way, too. Whereas in Canada, voter participation is pretty high.",
            "They can\u0027t believe she\u0027s Canadian?",
            "I think we\u0027ve developed the same attitudes that, say, the Pakistanis have towards India or, say, the border the Poles have to Russia. American culture somehow seizes you. But at the same time, we\u0027re not part of American culture. In fact, for years, Canadians have defined themselves-- or many Canadians have defined themselves-- as being, we\u0027re Canadian because we\u0027re not American. It\u0027s not a very good definition, but it\u0027s certainly one that a lot of people--",
            "Well, it depends how you measure them, though. Neil Armstrong is a great-- Neil Armstrong. He was American, right? He\u0027s the first guy who ever-- and he\u0027s American. It\u0027s incredible! No, Neil Young-- he\u0027s a brilliant songwriter and musician, so he hits the universal in that way.",
            "Well, that\u0027s, I think, you defining the song. It\u0027s not Neil defining the song. One of my favorite songs of his begins, \"There is a town in North Ontario.\" I\u0027d say that\u0027s the emblematic Neil Young song. And to me, he\u0027s hugely Canadian. Not only is he hugely Canadian because he writes the songs he does, because so many of them have a northern, isolated feel to them, because they are about strong emotion expressed quietly and expressed in a quiet vessel but also because his dad was a sportswriter for The Globe and Mail who everybody read. So I can\u0027t separate him out.",
            "Well, as I say, we\u0027re talking about the universal here, aren\u0027t we? You know what they say. If you want to sell something to everybody, make sure it has a large bust line. So she feels that--",
            "Marketers sometimes say that. What is she? She\u0027s like the most universally pneumatic vacuum in the world. So it\u0027s true. That doesn\u0027t feel particularly Canadian. And I understand why. But she\u0027s not a serious example. She\u0027s a woman--",
            "I only want to talk about the ones that you can actually measure on a real basis. I don\u0027t know what Pamela Lee was before she was inflated. But I\u0027d be willing to say the old, uninflated Pamela Lee, before she became almost the quintessential Hollywood bombshell, I\u0027ll bet you could find Canadian stuff about her. I don\u0027t know. It would be an interesting story. That\u0027s for sure.",
            "That is definitely American. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That part of Pamela Lee is as American as American goes.",
            "Americans. Americans. Because I work as a writer. And in Canada, one of the biggest parts of the job is to draw people out, to make them comfortable, to get them talking, to get them to realize that it\u0027s just a conversation, that they can be themselves. Americans are much less conscious of themselves. They have much less self-consciousness. They\u0027re much more themselves in the world. And damn it if you don\u0027t like it. I\u0027m an American. I\u0027m an individual.",
            "And so you get all this incredible unconscious behavior happening right in front you. It\u0027s like having your own little stage show wherever you go. There\u0027s always some entertainment because there\u0027s always people being themselves. You don\u0027t get that as much in Canada. And I found it--",
            "No, I don\u0027t mean in a condescending way. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not of it, but I love having a seat ringside.",
            "Well, exactly.",
            "It\u0027s flipped around. You\u0027re always slightly afraid and slightly amazed and slightly aware that you\u0027re swirling in some huge vortex that might just suck you down. At the same time, I should say that-- and I don\u0027t know whether this is a widely shared view-- but one of the reasons why Canadians are so obsessed with America is that it is such an energetic culture. It\u0027s so important in the world. It is the great empire of the 20th century-- has been. And you can\u0027t avoid that."

Who even remembers who Bobby Orr is, much less where he was born? Brandon\u0027s later comment as he ogles the girls from afar is, \"O, Canada.\" When their girlfriends get jealous, Brandon is like, we just got totally hosed, eh?",
            "In one episode, for no reason whatsoever, Brandon refers to Manitoba. In the season finale, Steve makes the throwaway statement that his American actress mother is doing theater in Toronto. In yet another, Kathleen Robertson\u0027s character, Clare Arnold, called Steve a hoser. Clare is often heard gratuitously attempting to speak mangled French, like the time when she wanted to say, \"let the best man win.\" In French, \"que le meilleur gagne,\" which instead came out \"culla mello gong,\" in what I can only imagine is a shout-out to Quebec or something."

They\u0027re playing with a tennis ball and hockey sticks. And the goalies are all in equipment. And when a car comes down the street, the first person to see the car yells, car! And everyone just stops the game and grabs the nets and gets to the side of the street. And then when the car passes, they say, game on! And they start playing again.",
            "And when I saw that, it was like it was a secret message from Mike Myers to me and all the other Canadians who were watching this movie in the American audience, because those were exactly the two phrases that we would use. And no American knows those phrases. And Mike Myers, of course, growing up in [? Otobaco, ?] the true Wayne\u0027s World, grew up playing road hockey just like I did. And the sad thing is, he couldn\u0027t set his movie in Canada because then it would\u0027ve been a Canadian movie, even if it was exactly the same movie. It was about Canadian culture, but in order to pass he had to set it in Illinois."

            "It goes without saying that Peter Jennings is a mole, a spy, a shill, a confederate for Canada. All you have to do is watch his program, as I did one week.",
            "He\u0027s not liberal or conservative. Jennings just seems to have it in for the American government. Sometimes his reference is implied, even bizarre.",
            "What are we being told by this story? It\u0027s not easy to parse, but it\u0027s either about an innocent Canadian blinded by our defense obsession or the superior maturity of Canada for not being directly involved in the two superpowers\u0027 now admittedly absurd arms race. So there\u0027s no question about where Peter\u0027s loyalties lie. In fact, Peter wants to come out of the Canadian closet. His Freudian slips cry out.",
            "Reckon you mean when you come back oot, don\u0027t you, stranger? Do you hear how Peter strains to split the difference between the Canadian oot and the American out? Listen again.",
            "You\u0027ll notice that Peter\u0027s always about to come back from somewhere.",
            "Or he\u0027s heading out.",
            "Or he\u0027s inviting us somewhere.",
            "See, Peter\u0027s on a journey to someplace. If you watch his show long enough, it\u0027s obvious. The very structure of the show has a sense that we\u0027re going somewhere-- a place, a mythical place. Every program has this feeling of zigzagging en route to some ultimate destination. And you know where he wants to take us? Canada. That\u0027s right, Canada.",
            "But actually, after you\u0027ve watched World News Tonight long enough, you realize that this is not a journey to the real Canada but to the platonic ideal of Canadian-ness. Stay with me here. See, Peter\u0027s news is noticeably different from Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw\u0027s. Tom and Dan see a hostile world erupting with bad news everywhere, full of murder and mayhem, macho and dismal, hell in a hand basket, fire and brimstone stuff. You know, very puritanical, very American in outlook.",
            "Dan\u0027s all clenched jaws, garretted coat and tie, a human time bomb waiting to explode. Peter\u0027s just kicking back. He could be wearing a smoking jacket and, during the commercial, sipping a mild single-malt Scotch. Once Peter gets past ridiculing the American government, it\u0027s odd, but suddenly, the news he\u0027s reading is uncannily bright. Cheerful and good news. Healing news. Soothing news. Ecumenical news. Canadian news.",
            "More comfortable dentistry. My, that is good news. But wait.",
            "No more food poisoning. Terrific.",
            "To understand the real meaning of this Canadian news, one has to read past the literal facts embedded in each statement and get to the level on which television actually speaks to us-- emotion. To really feel it, you have to merge the ads and the news into one seamless half hour of Peterphoria. You have to step a bit further back from the screen, lie down on a down comforter, and let it wash over you, like reading Finnegans Wake.",
            "And if you do this, suddenly the hidden meaning becomes instantaneously clear and weirdly repetitive. The message is, surrender. Your time is over. My fellow Americans, a great nation is being asked to lie down and give it up. Peter\u0027s meaning is clear. Even superpowers must age and yield and settle down. One ad that airs a couple of times every show is for SunAmerica. Sun, as in setting sun.",
            "Retire. No commercial break passes without the word reverberating through the screen. But of course, Peter and his fellow travelers try to keep this message lively and vibrant.",
            "It\u0027s OK, see? Over time though, the message goes even further than that. Why just retire? Even the musical score begins to hint at the next logical option.",
            "I don\u0027t think I\u0027m stretching here. You heard it yourself. The message is, let it go. Cross all the way over to the other side. The entire half hour is a kind of advertisement for dark eternity.",
            "This is cotton? Honey, this is a shroud. Just when is it that you stop living and look around? We\u0027re dying here. See how obvious it is once you take off your rose-colored glasses and see what\u0027s in front of your face? Once you tune in at this level-- the real level-- each commercial gets increasingly more frightening.",
            "Someplace safe and secure. Someplace like America, but without all those tense Dan Rather troubles. Someplace like Canada. And isn\u0027t that how Americans have always thought of Canada? It\u0027s like America, only without any jazz. Tranquil and safe and secure and endless, like death. If only Peter can take us to that place where we no longer have any anxiety. If only Peter can remove the sting. If only Peter can end the fear. If only.",

            "It\u0027s not just that my sister actually lives in Canada, and right in the heart of the country where it\u0027s winter for eight months out of the year, that makes me think of her as the quintessential Canadian. And it\u0027s not even her ideas about the place or her sense of patriotism. It\u0027s more the way that she lives in Canada, connected to her small community and her neighbors and the natural world around her, working at her church and in her kitchen and in her garden. That, to me, is a Canadian life. And from my studio apartment in New York, her life in Winnipeg seems very far away. And I think to her, I seem far away, too.",

There\u0027s a sense of betrayal, but there\u0027s also just a sense of sadness and a realization that that\u0027s the reality of the world and the economy that we live in. And also, maybe weariness, almost, when another one goes.",

But I think until now, I\u0027ve always felt like you\u0027re just living there and working there and eventually, you\u0027ll come back.",

            "Yeah, I think that\u0027s really a struggle for Canadians. And in some way, I think it\u0027s that struggle that, ironically, defines what the answer is. I think in some ways, the answer is that a Canadian is someone who struggles to figure out what is to be Canadian and not American. And all of those things, it\u0027s really hard to make a pavilion about. There\u0027s that eternal problem of how do you make a Canadian knight? How do you make a Canadian pavilion? And you kind of have maple syrup, and that\u0027s the end of it. And we don\u0027t have a nice national dress and national food. And we have, well, the beaver, and not too much else.",
            "It\u0027s interesting because I talk about you often when I talk to people. And I talk about you as being my brother who has gone off and lived in the United States. And I talk about you with a great deal of pride. And people certainly respond by being very impressed. But there\u0027s that sense in which-- so I was thinking, if you came here, you would be a celebrity in the sense that you\u0027re my brother who lives in the United States and you live this highly sophisticated life and you live in New York City and everyone\u0027s deeply impressed by this.",
            "But you wouldn\u0027t be of us. I think the perception would be very different if you had done the same thing over the last 10 years in London, England. I think you would be perceived as being more Canadian still than having gone to the United States for 10 years. I suspect it might even be true if you had gone to another European country, that you would still be perceived as being more Canadian than you would be perceived now.",
