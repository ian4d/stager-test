        "I was in this all-white high school. It was 3,500 kids, and there was only eight black kids that went to this school. And so I was trying to find some way to be hip at that time.",
        "I was in a fish-fry place. And I saw these four black guys sitting in this booth eating jack salmon sandwiches and dinners with dark glasses on and hats and their hair was conked and everything. So I thought they looked pretty hip. So I went and got my sandwich and sat behind them. And at that time, they were talking about this homeboy from East St. Louis. And he was in New York City, and he was doing all these great things and playing all this great music and had played with Charlie Parker. Who I didn\u0027t know any of this.",
        "And they said, Miles Dewey Davis. Miles Davis. His name is Miles Davis. And they went up to the record player and put in some money and played \"Donna Lee.\" And I remember listening to \"Donna Lee.\" And I said, wow. I hadn\u0027t liked jazz up until that point. I was about 14, 15 years old. I was into Johnny Ace and Chuck Berry and that kind of music, rhythm and blues. And when I heard this music, for some reason-- they played it twice. And the second time, it kind of went straight to my heart. I can\u0027t explain why it went straight to my heart, but I loved the music.",
        "And I sat there, and they sat there for about an hour. And then they left. And when they left, I remember going up to the record player. And I had about $0.30 or something. It was a nickel to play those records. And I went up there, flipped through all those names, and found Miles Davis\u0027 name and played \"Donna Lee.\" And I played \"Donna Lee,\" then I played another one.",
        "That\u0027s when I first heard Miles Davis. And then after that, my cousin told me how hip he was and showed me pictures of him and how clean he was. I started seeing how well he dressed and what great style he had.",
        "Yeah. We used to say he was \"clean as a broke dick dog,\" which was a saying that came out of St. Louis. And so I said, wow, this is a guy that I really love. So I started really listening to his music at that time. And it kind of changed my life. And then I found some other friends who had been listening to him for a while. And I kind of left my other friends and started listening to Miles and hanging out with them. And we used to sit up in this stands at Sumner High School and say we were going to run away to New York and be like Miles Davis.",
        "So I remember the first time he came to St. Louis. There was all this big buzz about him coming to play there. And I had doctored up my draft card, and changed all the dates and everything, so I could be old enough to get into the club. And I remember going to the pawn shop and getting these great suits and these Church\u0027s shoes, which were too small for my feet. They were those really hip English shoes. And I had this big Chesterfield hat, and I was really clean. But my feet hurt. And my feet hurt because the shoes were too small. The shoes were too small.",
        "So I go to Peacock Alley with some friends of mine. And we get in. The guy kind of looked at me and said, are you really-- because I was really young looking. But he let me in, finally. He just let me in. And when that band hit, they were so fantastic. They were so fantastic. And Miles was so clean. He was so clean and so hip that I was just mesmerized.",
        "And so I told my cousin, who went with us, that I wanted to go up and say hello to Miles and tell him how much I loved his music. And so my cousin said, \"Quincy, don\u0027t go up and say nothing to Miles, because Miles doesn\u0027t talk to people. He doesn\u0027t like people coming up to him and talking to him. So don\u0027t go up to him and say anything. Just look at him from a distance.\"",
        "So we kind of stood back and looked at him from a distance, all of us. It was a whole bunch of us, young guys and older guys. We had our glasses and everything on like he had his glasses on. And we kind of looked at him standing at the bar, smoking a cigarette, drinking a cognac. And from behind us someplace, I heard this voice say, \"Oh, darling, there\u0027s Miles Davis.\"",
        "And I turned around, and it was this white guy with his girlfriend. And I said, \"Whoa, what is he going to do?\" He said, \"Let\u0027s go up and say hello.\" So he walked through us, \"Excuse me, excuse me.\" And he walked up to Miles Davis, who was standing at the bar with Coltrane and all him. He said, \"Hi, Miles. How are you?\" And Miles said in that gruff voice, \"Eff you. Get out of my face,\" like that.",
        "And I was like, \"Wow.\" That was stunning. I had never heard anybody talk to anyone like that, let alone an African-American man say that to a white guy. And I just said to myself, \"Man, this is something.\"",
        "Yes. I was living in New York. And my friend, Leo Maitland, who is now deceased, was a doctor. And he was Miles\u0027 doctor. And he used to always say to me, \"I know Miles Davis.\" I said, \"You got to introduce me to Miles. You got to introduce me to Miles.\"",
        "So one day, he said, \"I\u0027m going to have this party.\" And I said, \"OK.\" \"You want to come?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" So I go to the party. And I walk in, and I\u0027m sitting around. And he had this great apartment. And I look over in the corner, and there\u0027s Miles Davis. I said, \"My god, Miles Davis.\" And there was nobody sitting next to him. His was the only seat in the house with nobody sitting next to him. So I went and got some food and I looked around, no place to sit, and went into another room, there wasn\u0027t no place to sit. I came back, there was this seat.",
        "So I went and sat next to Miles. So I remember him saying something like, \"How are you doing?\" I said, \"Hi. All right.\" \"Yeah, you sure?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"You see anything good in here?\" I say, \"What?\" \"Anything, man. I\u0027m talking about do you see anything good?\" And I said, \"There\u0027s some nice ladies in here.\" \"That\u0027s right. That\u0027s right. You got a good eye.\"",
        "So I said, \"Yeah, I love your music.\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk about my music. I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" I said, \"OK.\" So then we had this general conversation. And then he went and got some food, came back, said to me, \"Later.\" And he left.",
        "So about two weeks later, I was walking down this--",
        "I was totally up for it. I had no fear in talking to him, I guess, maybe, because by this time, I was starting to get a little play myself, as a writer, in New York. I was starting to get some ink. And I had a kind of feeling about myself at that point. And so it was funny. We just kind of had this exchange. And then when he got ready to leave, he just left. He just left. But he came over to me and said, \"Later.\" So I thought it was some kind of indication that he liked the conversation or whatever.",
        "And so about three weeks later, I was walking down Broadway. And here he comes walking straight towards me. And I said, \"Oh, that\u0027s Miles Davis.\" So when he got up next to me, I said, \"Hey, Miles. How you doing?\" He walked right by me. Like I didn\u0027t even exist. Like I wasn\u0027t even on the planet. I mean, he didn\u0027t even nod, or nothing. He just walked right by me.",
        "And I stopped. I remember stopping, and I kind of looked back and said, \"Wow, was that Miles Davis?\" And it was. I said, \"Yeah, that\u0027s him. But he didn\u0027t speak.\" I said, \"Hey, Miles.\" And he didn\u0027t even turn around. He just kept going. So I said, \"Wow, that was kind of cold.\" I mean, that was kind of cold. It was like, I had never experienced that before in my life.",
        "And so when I got to know him, I finally got to know him real well, when I did the Spin Magazine. I did a two-part piece for Spin Magazine. And when I walked in his place, he looked at me and he kind of said, \"Yeah, sit down.\" So I sit down. And I remember him reaching out with his hand to grab my dreadlocks. And I hit his hand. Pow. And he said, \"What are you, crazy? What are you crazy, hitting me like that?\"",
        "I said, \"No, man.\" I said, \"Because I\u0027m over here to interview you doesn\u0027t mean that you have the right to invade my space.\" I said, \"Plus, the other times that I tried to talk to you, you just shined me on.\" He said, \"Oh, you mean the time out on the street? The time out on the street?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Man, I don\u0027t have to talk to you, man. I didn\u0027t have to talk to you. What you got to talk about this time?\"",
        "And that\u0027s the way it started. And we got to be the best of friends until he died. But Miles was always testing you. He was always testing you. He was the kind of guy-- and I loved him because he was always the kind of a guy that was always testing you. And if you passed the muster, if you could stand up to him, then if he liked you, he would bring you in. If you couldn\u0027t, he\u0027d just run over you, you know?",
        "You know, I got very up close with Miles. I mean, I was in his pocket and he was in my pocket for two and a half, three years. Until the time he died. I mean, I was really close to him. And so I saw flaws in his personality that-- because I think when you idolize a person like him-- like he was one of my heroes-- especially when you\u0027re young, you don\u0027t think they have flaws. You kind of see them through these rose-tinted glasses. And you kind of look at them as perfect.",
        "And so when I started to see some things that was not perfect about Miles, like his way of treating women and his way of treating other people sometimes and little small things, like cleanliness sometimes.",
        "Well, Miles was a clean person. In terms of his body and the way he dressed, but there were a couple of times when I went over his house one day-- I went over to his house one day, and it was a mess. I mean, stuff was everywhere. Clothes, toothbrush, toothpaste, music, trumpets.",
        "And I said, \"Miles, man,\" I said, \"Miles, you living like a pig, man.\" I said, \"You\u0027re living like a pig, man. This is a pigsty.\" He said, \"So what? So what? So what, it\u0027s a pigsty? What did you expect? I just play music, chump.\" He said, \"Somebody cleans it up. That\u0027s the deal.\"",
        "Well, I would see some of that. And first I would say, man this guy could be a pig, you know? But then, I got to the point where I said, no, he\u0027s just a human being. He\u0027s a human being. He has flaws. He plays beautiful music. But he had these little areas where he was just a human being, where he was flawed. Like, I never thought Miles would be as country as he was. You know, what I mean by country. I mean country-country, like a Southern-- instead of a jazz musician, when you got to know Miles, like some elegant jazz musician, Miles was like a country blues singer.",
        "When I was doing the book, and I was about three or four months in, when he started dropping the mask. And he\u0027d just drop the mask. And I\u0027d come by, and he\u0027d have food. And he\u0027d cook for me. And we\u0027d look at boxing matches and look at the basketball games. And at first, when I would go over there, he would always be dressed elegantly in very fashionable stuff. And then after that, he started dressing just really casually. And especially on the West Coast. When I\u0027d go up there, he\u0027d have on blue jeans, a torn sweater. And he would just cook. And we\u0027d just sit there and look and tell lies. And he\u0027d listen to the fights. And we\u0027d go for long walks on the beach. And he\u0027d take me for rides in his car.",
        "So it was just a beautiful kind of relationship. As a matter of fact, I told him, I said, \"You know, when you\u0027re in California, you\u0027re much different than you are in New York.\" And he said, \"Yeah.\" After a while, he acknowledged that. He said, \"Yeah, because in New York, I\u0027ve got to keep my mask up.\" I said, \"Yeah, that\u0027s right. You got to keep it up.\"",
        "Well, when I started to hear some of the stories. Because Miles was brutally honest. He was brutally honest when he did that book. I remember he was telling me the stories of him beating up these women and chasing his wife around the basement of their house with a knife and a gun. And so I started to think to myself, wow, this is ouch. I mean, this is a strange kind of situation, because I\u0027m just the opposite. I don\u0027t believe in hitting women. I don\u0027t believe in hitting anybody like that.",
        "But I figured out that Miles Davis was the kind of person-- he wasn\u0027t an intellectual, where he could respond and talk it out, talk the whole thing through. So if you got up in his face, whether you were a man or a woman, he would hit you. That was the way he was. I mean, he would hit you.",
        "I can be truthful and say I didn\u0027t like the way he did certain things. But then at the same time, we who knew him really well knew that he was a warm and generous person to us. And we\u0027d look at those things and say, hey man, that was kind of cold what he did there. But the way I looked at it, I\u0027d say, well, that\u0027s between him and that person.",
        "I never saw him hit a woman in front of me. Because you\u0027ve got to remember, I knew him from 1985 until he died, which was a period of six years. And so when he was in his most desperately insane period of really doing these kind of things to women, this was from 1968 to 1980, 12 years. And I didn\u0027t know him then. So I never saw that.",
        "When it would generally happen was when somebody would come up to me and say to me, \"Man, what is it like to be with Miles Davis? You know, I always wanted to be with Miles Davis.\" And then I would think, whoa.",
        "But for me, after it got to a certain level, I never thought about it. Because we just had this natural relationship. He\u0027d call me up or I\u0027d call him up.",
        "I remember telling somebody one time, Miles called me up from Japan. He had just taped this new thing. And he said, \"What do you think of this?\" And he put it on. And he played for about five minutes. And he said, \"What did you think?\" And I would tell him whether I liked it or I didn\u0027t. If I didn\u0027t like it, I would tell him I didn\u0027t like it. And I was relating this to somebody. And they said, \"You mean Miles Davis calls you up, and puts on the tape, and you listen to it?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Well, what\u0027s that like?\" I said, \"I guess it\u0027s like any one of my friends who is a poet, who will say \u0027listen to this poem,\u0027 you know what I mean? It just so happens it\u0027s Miles Davis\u0027 music, and he happens to be internationally famous.\"",
        "I remember one time, I was with him-- I can\u0027t remember the Japanese, it was not [? Miashi, ?] but it was another Japanese designer. And he had his clothes in New York. And he had his clothes, and he had Andy Warhol, before Andy Warhol died, and Miles Davis modeling as the star models of the clothes, along with all these beautiful, gorgeous women. So Miles called me and said, \"Do you want to go down with me?\" I said, \"Yeah, I\u0027ll go with you.\"",
        "So we go in this place called The Tunnel. It was some kind of a discotheque. So we\u0027re in there and they\u0027re modeling the clothes, and everybody\u0027s going out. Miles would walk out. Andy Warhol would walk out. So I\u0027m backstage with Andy. And these are two legends. These are two American icons in culture. So Miles was the finale. And he had this outfit with this gold lame cape that he was supposed to walk out, with a hat.",
        "So he started to walk out. And Andy was standing there looking at him. And the cape was dragging on the floor. So he started to walk out. And he turned around and looked at Andy Warhol. And he said, \"Andy, Andy. Pick up that cape.\" So Andy picked up the cape and they walked out together, you know what I mean? And Andy had this sheepish look on his face.",
        "And Miles strutted out, and Andy was holding the cape off the floor. And they walked up the thing. And so everybody in the room-- they left us in the room. Andy\u0027s handlers, they were like shocked. They had never heard anything like that. They were like, \"Wow, did you see that? Did you see that?\" But Andy was smiling. He was happy to be in it. He was happy to be in it.",
        "And so that was Miles. Miles Davis was almost like a king, you know what I mean? He was like a king. And so that particular moment, I remember his attitude was like, \"I\u0027m the king here. Pick up the cape. We both might be icons, but I\u0027m a bigger icon than you.\""

And we used to sit up in this stands at Sumner High School and say we were going to run away to New York and be like Miles Davis.",
        "And I turned around, and it was this white guy with his girlfriend. And I said, \"Whoa, what is he going to do?\" He said, \"Let\u0027s go up and say hello.\" So he walked through us, \"Excuse me, excuse me.\" And he walked up to Miles Davis, who was standing at the bar with Coltrane and all him. He said, \"Hi, Miles. How are you?\" And Miles said in that gruff voice, \"Eff you. Get out of my face,\" like that.",
        "And they said, Miles Dewey Davis. Miles Davis. His name is Miles Davis. And they went up to the record player and put in some money and played \"Donna Lee.\" And I remember listening to \"Donna Lee.\" And I said, wow. I hadn\u0027t liked jazz up until that point. I was about 14, 15 years old. I was into Johnny Ace and Chuck Berry and that kind of music, rhythm and blues. And when I heard this music, for some reason-- they played it twice. And the second time, it kind of went straight to my heart. I can\u0027t explain why it went straight to my heart, but I loved the music.",
        "So about two weeks later, I was walking down this--",
        "And I stopped. I remember stopping, and I kind of looked back and said, \"Wow, was that Miles Davis?\" And it was. I said, \"Yeah, that\u0027s him. But he didn\u0027t speak.\" I said, \"Hey, Miles.\" And he didn\u0027t even turn around. He just kept going. So I said, \"Wow, that was kind of cold.\" I mean, that was kind of cold. It was like, I had never experienced that before in my life.",
        "So we kind of stood back and looked at him from a distance, all of us. It was a whole bunch of us, young guys and older guys. We had our glasses and everything on like he had his glasses on. And we kind of looked at him standing at the bar, smoking a cigarette, drinking a cognac. And from behind us someplace, I heard this voice say, \"Oh, darling, there\u0027s Miles Davis.\"",
        "But for me, after it got to a certain level, I never thought about it. Because we just had this natural relationship. He\u0027d call me up or I\u0027d call him up.",
        "You know, I got very up close with Miles. I mean, I was in his pocket and he was in my pocket for two and a half, three years. Until the time he died. I mean, I was really close to him. And so I saw flaws in his personality that-- because I think when you idolize a person like him-- like he was one of my heroes-- especially when you\u0027re young, you don\u0027t think they have flaws. You kind of see them through these rose-tinted glasses. And you kind of look at them as perfect.",
        "When it would generally happen was when somebody would come up to me and say to me, \"Man, what is it like to be with Miles Davis? You know, I always wanted to be with Miles Davis.\" And then I would think, whoa.",
        "But I figured out that Miles Davis was the kind of person-- he wasn\u0027t an intellectual, where he could respond and talk it out, talk the whole thing through. So if you got up in his face, whether you were a man or a woman, he would hit you. That was the way he was. I mean, he would hit you.",
        "And Miles strutted out, and Andy was holding the cape off the floor. And they walked up the thing. And so everybody in the room-- they left us in the room. Andy\u0027s handlers, they were like shocked. They had never heard anything like that. They were like, \"Wow, did you see that? Did you see that?\" But Andy was smiling. He was happy to be in it. He was happy to be in it.",
        "And I was like, \"Wow.\" That was stunning. I had never heard anybody talk to anyone like that, let alone an African-American man say that to a white guy. And I just said to myself, \"Man, this is something.\"",
        "I was totally up for it. I had no fear in talking to him, I guess, maybe, because by this time, I was starting to get a little play myself, as a writer, in New York. I was starting to get some ink. And I had a kind of feeling about myself at that point. And so it was funny. We just kind of had this exchange. And then when he got ready to leave, he just left. He just left. But he came over to me and said, \"Later.\" So I thought it was some kind of indication that he liked the conversation or whatever.",
        "And so about three weeks later, I was walking down Broadway. And here he comes walking straight towards me. And I said, \"Oh, that\u0027s Miles Davis.\" So when he got up next to me, I said, \"Hey, Miles. How you doing?\" He walked right by me. Like I didn\u0027t even exist. Like I wasn\u0027t even on the planet. I mean, he didn\u0027t even nod, or nothing. He just walked right by me.",
        "And I said, \"Miles, man,\" I said, \"Miles, you living like a pig, man.\" I said, \"You\u0027re living like a pig, man. This is a pigsty.\" He said, \"So what? So what? So what, it\u0027s a pigsty? What did you expect? I just play music, chump.\" He said, \"Somebody cleans it up. That\u0027s the deal.\"",
        "When I was doing the book, and I was about three or four months in, when he started dropping the mask. And he\u0027d just drop the mask. And I\u0027d come by, and he\u0027d have food. And he\u0027d cook for me. And we\u0027d look at boxing matches and look at the basketball games. And at first, when I would go over there, he would always be dressed elegantly in very fashionable stuff. And then after that, he started dressing just really casually. And especially on the West Coast. When I\u0027d go up there, he\u0027d have on blue jeans, a torn sweater. And he would just cook. And we\u0027d just sit there and look and tell lies. And he\u0027d listen to the fights. And we\u0027d go for long walks on the beach. And he\u0027d take me for rides in his car.",
        "So I go to Peacock Alley with some friends of mine. And we get in. The guy kind of looked at me and said, are you really-- because I was really young looking. But he let me in, finally. He just let me in. And when that band hit, they were so fantastic. They were so fantastic. And Miles was so clean. He was so clean and so hip that I was just mesmerized.",
        "Yes. I was living in New York. And my friend, Leo Maitland, who is now deceased, was a doctor. And he was Miles\u0027 doctor. And he used to always say to me, \"I know Miles Davis.\" I said, \"You got to introduce me to Miles. You got to introduce me to Miles.\"",
        "Well, when I started to hear some of the stories. Because Miles was brutally honest. He was brutally honest when he did that book. I remember he was telling me the stories of him beating up these women and chasing his wife around the basement of their house with a knife and a gun. And so I started to think to myself, wow, this is ouch. I mean, this is a strange kind of situation, because I\u0027m just the opposite. I don\u0027t believe in hitting women. I don\u0027t believe in hitting anybody like that.",
        "That\u0027s when I first heard Miles Davis. And then after that, my cousin told me how hip he was and showed me pictures of him and how clean he was. I started seeing how well he dressed and what great style he had.",
        "I remember one time, I was with him-- I can\u0027t remember the Japanese, it was not [? Miashi, ?] but it was another Japanese designer. And he had his clothes in New York. And he had his clothes, and he had Andy Warhol, before Andy Warhol died, and Miles Davis modeling as the star models of the clothes, along with all these beautiful, gorgeous women. So Miles called me and said, \"Do you want to go down with me?\" I said, \"Yeah, I\u0027ll go with you.\"",
        "I was in a fish-fry place. And I saw these four black guys sitting in this booth eating jack salmon sandwiches and dinners with dark glasses on and hats and their hair was conked and everything. So I thought they looked pretty hip. So I went and got my sandwich and sat behind them. And at that time, they were talking about this homeboy from East St. Louis. And he was in New York City, and he was doing all these great things and playing all this great music and had played with Charlie Parker. Who I didn\u0027t know any of this.",
        "So I remember the first time he came to St. Louis. There was all this big buzz about him coming to play there. And I had doctored up my draft card, and changed all the dates and everything, so I could be old enough to get into the club. And I remember going to the pawn shop and getting these great suits and these Church\u0027s shoes, which were too small for my feet. They were those really hip English shoes. And I had this big Chesterfield hat, and I was really clean. But my feet hurt. And my feet hurt because the shoes were too small. The shoes were too small.",
        "And so I told my cousin, who went with us, that I wanted to go up and say hello to Miles and tell him how much I loved his music. And so my cousin said, \"Quincy, don\u0027t go up and say nothing to Miles, because Miles doesn\u0027t talk to people. He doesn\u0027t like people coming up to him and talking to him. So don\u0027t go up to him and say anything. Just look at him from a distance.\"",
        "I said, \"No, man.\" I said, \"Because I\u0027m over here to interview you doesn\u0027t mean that you have the right to invade my space.\" I said, \"Plus, the other times that I tried to talk to you, you just shined me on.\" He said, \"Oh, you mean the time out on the street? The time out on the street?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Man, I don\u0027t have to talk to you, man. I didn\u0027t have to talk to you. What you got to talk about this time?\"",
        "So I said, \"Yeah, I love your music.\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk about my music. I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" I said, \"OK.\" So then we had this general conversation. And then he went and got some food, came back, said to me, \"Later.\" And he left.",
        "Well, I would see some of that. And first I would say, man this guy could be a pig, you know? But then, I got to the point where I said, no, he\u0027s just a human being. He\u0027s a human being. He has flaws. He plays beautiful music. But he had these little areas where he was just a human being, where he was flawed. Like, I never thought Miles would be as country as he was. You know, what I mean by country. I mean country-country, like a Southern-- instead of a jazz musician, when you got to know Miles, like some elegant jazz musician, Miles was like a country blues singer."

        "This is yesterday?",
        "To hear the family tell it, it\u0027s like a miracle that Jessica got well. It was like she was chosen. In fact, Jessica was chosen once before. When Selena was still alive, Jessica and her family were at a concert in [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. She and her mom were standing outside the backstage entrance. And Selena\u0027s sister, Suzette, picked Jessica out of a huge crowd of little girls to have her picture taken with Selena.",
        "Jessica is a beautiful little girl. She has long black hair and a cinnamon complexion. She\u0027s wearing a Selena outfit, knee-length boots, spandex hot pants, and a black, padded bustier with gold trimming over the breast. It\u0027s Jessica\u0027s dream to be like Selena. She wants to be a singer and sing in English and Spanish. She came to the auditions, but not just so she could be a movie star. It\u0027s like she wants to feel closer to Selena.",
        "A lot of people still cry over Selena. She was so lovable, just her smile. She was like a little girl. When she went to the Grammy Awards, she went there with her camera, wanted to take pictures with everybody. Selena put a positive role. She made it seem like it\u0027s not bad to be Mexican-American. I asked Jessica in Spanish how she felt about Selena\u0027s death. She started crying.",
        "Then I started crying too.",

There was Selena music everywhere, TV cameras, girls were fixing their hair and putting their makeup on. People were dancing. At one point, we were talking to these two girls. They sang us a Selena song. And pretty soon, people we didn\u0027t even know were joining in. Everybody was singing. It was just that kind of thing. One of the girls we met came all the way from New York with her mother and her little sister. It was kind of a secret mission.",

        "No. He doesn\u0027t know that?",
        "Yeah, that\u0027s good. Mama saved her daughters.",
        "When you finally get inside to the audition, it\u0027s kind of disappointing. It\u0027s like it\u0027s over before it starts. There were 20 girls on the stage at a time. They sit you down at these tables, give you this fake smile, hand you a card to fill out, ask you one question, then tell you to stand up and dance. You dance for 30 seconds. Sometimes they don\u0027t even play music. When I went up there, the woman running my table didn\u0027t even know who Selena was. She didn\u0027t bother to look at me. When we were dancing, they only gave you 60 seconds total to make an impression. So what are they looking for?",
        "What kind of magic?",
        "This is the director Greg Nava. He told me there were three auditions, in LA, Chicago, and in Texas. I thought, if he wants magic, I\u0027ll give him magic. I told him about Jessica. Of everyone I interviewed, she had the pizazz. She looked like Selena, she had big dreams like Selena, and she has Selena in her heart.",

        "After a long day, the crowds are cleared. Two cousins who flew in from Texas were sitting outside in the cold, eating pizza, and waiting for a Chicago family friend to pick them up. They had arrived early in the morning and didn\u0027t get much sleep. They weren\u0027t sure when their ride was coming or where they were going to spend the night. I asked them what they thought of the auditions.",
        "Yeah, but why? What did you expect?",
        "What makes you think that they\u0027re looking for something different?",
        "They had spent $135 each, saved from babysitting, to get to Chicago. But they didn\u0027t feel bad.",
        "They just sat there on the bench waiting. They weren\u0027t really dressed for Chicago weather. They wore fishnet pantyhose, real short shorts, bustiers, and thin leather jackets. You could tell they were really cold. They were anxious for their ride to show up.",

        "To hear the family tell it, it\u0027s like a miracle that Jessica got well. It was like she was chosen. In fact, Jessica was chosen once before. When Selena was still alive, Jessica and her family were at a concert in [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. She and her mom were standing outside the backstage entrance. And Selena\u0027s sister, Suzette, picked Jessica out of a huge crowd of little girls to have her picture taken with Selena.",
        "After Selena\u0027s death, Jessica and her family went to visit her grave in Corpus Christi, Texas.",
        "Then I started crying too.",
        "I don\u0027t like saying death. That\u0027s why.",
        "The words mean, \"Like the flower with much love, you gave to me. I\u0027ll march on. I know how to lose a love. But oh my, how it hurts me.\"",
        "She left already. She told me that she wants to be Selena. She made me cry. And she doesn\u0027t even want to get paid.",
        "They just sat there on the bench waiting. They weren\u0027t really dressed for Chicago weather. They wore fishnet pantyhose, real short shorts, bustiers, and thin leather jackets. You could tell they were really cold. They were anxious for their ride to show up.",
        "A couple weeks later, it was announced that none of the girls from the open auditions were chosen for the Selena part. Not them, not me, not Jessica. Nobody.",
        "After a long day, the crowds are cleared. Two cousins who flew in from Texas were sitting outside in the cold, eating pizza, and waiting for a Chicago family friend to pick them up. They had arrived early in the morning and didn\u0027t get much sleep. They weren\u0027t sure when their ride was coming or where they were going to spend the night. I asked them what they thought of the auditions.",
        "What makes you think that they\u0027re looking for something different?",
        "I want to show you this little girl. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve seen her.",
        "I like it because she sings it with a mariachi. And it\u0027s an old song from Mexico.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They had spent $135 each, saved from babysitting, to get to Chicago. But they didn\u0027t feel bad.",
        "I met all sorts of people at auditions. Everybody was really dressed up and looked fabulous. There was Selena music everywhere, TV cameras, girls were fixing their hair and putting their makeup on. People were dancing. At one point, we were talking to these two girls. They sang us a Selena song. And pretty soon, people we didn\u0027t even know were joining in. Everybody was singing. It was just that kind of thing. One of the girls we met came all the way from New York with her mother and her little sister. It was kind of a secret mission.",
        "Well, you don\u0027t. That\u0027s why she didn\u0027t sing with mariachi. She was more of a beat-y person, with a lot of beat. And that\u0027s why this song, this one and this other song that she sang, everybody sang it when she left.",
        "Jessica is a beautiful little girl. She has long black hair and a cinnamon complexion. She\u0027s wearing a Selena outfit, knee-length boots, spandex hot pants, and a black, padded bustier with gold trimming over the breast. It\u0027s Jessica\u0027s dream to be like Selena. She wants to be a singer and sing in English and Spanish. She came to the auditions, but not just so she could be a movie star. It\u0027s like she wants to feel closer to Selena.",
        "Yeah, that\u0027s good. Mama saved her daughters.",
        "So your dad\u0027s at home?"

And yet he kind of pushes it away a little bit by sort of writing on there \"I\u0027m too sad to tell you.\" And actually, there he is again. There he is again with his hair longer. You see now, you see the first version with short hair and then the second one with his longer hair. And I prefer it short, out of the two photos. I definitely feel much more attracted to the one where his hair is a little bit shorter. It looks very now, both-- the hair styles are very retro \u002770s now with guys."

And the facts of his life only enhanced the air of mystery and romance in the picture. He did a kind of conceptual art, Bas Jan Ader, this conceptual art that involved a lot of physical challenges that he would set for himself. In one piece, he was photographed falling off the roof of a house. In another, he falls out of a tree. They\u0027re goofy, almost comical photos. But other works of his, like the crying pictures, have a kind of wistful, longing quality."

            "I was in this all-white high school. It was 3,500 kids, and there was only eight black kids that went to this school. And so I was trying to find some way to be hip at that time.",
            "I was in a fish-fry place. And I saw these four black guys sitting in this booth eating jack salmon sandwiches and dinners with dark glasses on and hats and their hair was conked and everything. So I thought they looked pretty hip. So I went and got my sandwich and sat behind them. And at that time, they were talking about this homeboy from East St. Louis. And he was in New York City, and he was doing all these great things and playing all this great music and had played with Charlie Parker. Who I didn\u0027t know any of this.",
            "And they said, Miles Dewey Davis. Miles Davis. His name is Miles Davis. And they went up to the record player and put in some money and played \"Donna Lee.\" And I remember listening to \"Donna Lee.\" And I said, wow. I hadn\u0027t liked jazz up until that point. I was about 14, 15 years old. I was into Johnny Ace and Chuck Berry and that kind of music, rhythm and blues. And when I heard this music, for some reason-- they played it twice. And the second time, it kind of went straight to my heart. I can\u0027t explain why it went straight to my heart, but I loved the music.",
            "And I sat there, and they sat there for about an hour. And then they left. And when they left, I remember going up to the record player. And I had about $0.30 or something. It was a nickel to play those records. And I went up there, flipped through all those names, and found Miles Davis\u0027 name and played \"Donna Lee.\" And I played \"Donna Lee,\" then I played another one.",
            "That\u0027s when I first heard Miles Davis. And then after that, my cousin told me how hip he was and showed me pictures of him and how clean he was. I started seeing how well he dressed and what great style he had.",
            "Yeah. We used to say he was \"clean as a broke dick dog,\" which was a saying that came out of St. Louis. And so I said, wow, this is a guy that I really love. So I started really listening to his music at that time. And it kind of changed my life. And then I found some other friends who had been listening to him for a while. And I kind of left my other friends and started listening to Miles and hanging out with them. And we used to sit up in this stands at Sumner High School and say we were going to run away to New York and be like Miles Davis.",
            "So I remember the first time he came to St. Louis. There was all this big buzz about him coming to play there. And I had doctored up my draft card, and changed all the dates and everything, so I could be old enough to get into the club. And I remember going to the pawn shop and getting these great suits and these Church\u0027s shoes, which were too small for my feet. They were those really hip English shoes. And I had this big Chesterfield hat, and I was really clean. But my feet hurt. And my feet hurt because the shoes were too small. The shoes were too small.",
            "So I go to Peacock Alley with some friends of mine. And we get in. The guy kind of looked at me and said, are you really-- because I was really young looking. But he let me in, finally. He just let me in. And when that band hit, they were so fantastic. They were so fantastic. And Miles was so clean. He was so clean and so hip that I was just mesmerized.",
            "And so I told my cousin, who went with us, that I wanted to go up and say hello to Miles and tell him how much I loved his music. And so my cousin said, \"Quincy, don\u0027t go up and say nothing to Miles, because Miles doesn\u0027t talk to people. He doesn\u0027t like people coming up to him and talking to him. So don\u0027t go up to him and say anything. Just look at him from a distance.\"",
            "So we kind of stood back and looked at him from a distance, all of us. It was a whole bunch of us, young guys and older guys. We had our glasses and everything on like he had his glasses on. And we kind of looked at him standing at the bar, smoking a cigarette, drinking a cognac. And from behind us someplace, I heard this voice say, \"Oh, darling, there\u0027s Miles Davis.\"",
            "And I turned around, and it was this white guy with his girlfriend. And I said, \"Whoa, what is he going to do?\" He said, \"Let\u0027s go up and say hello.\" So he walked through us, \"Excuse me, excuse me.\" And he walked up to Miles Davis, who was standing at the bar with Coltrane and all him. He said, \"Hi, Miles. How are you?\" And Miles said in that gruff voice, \"Eff you. Get out of my face,\" like that.",
            "And I was like, \"Wow.\" That was stunning. I had never heard anybody talk to anyone like that, let alone an African-American man say that to a white guy. And I just said to myself, \"Man, this is something.\"",
            "Yes. I was living in New York. And my friend, Leo Maitland, who is now deceased, was a doctor. And he was Miles\u0027 doctor. And he used to always say to me, \"I know Miles Davis.\" I said, \"You got to introduce me to Miles. You got to introduce me to Miles.\"",
            "So one day, he said, \"I\u0027m going to have this party.\" And I said, \"OK.\" \"You want to come?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" So I go to the party. And I walk in, and I\u0027m sitting around. And he had this great apartment. And I look over in the corner, and there\u0027s Miles Davis. I said, \"My god, Miles Davis.\" And there was nobody sitting next to him. His was the only seat in the house with nobody sitting next to him. So I went and got some food and I looked around, no place to sit, and went into another room, there wasn\u0027t no place to sit. I came back, there was this seat.",
            "So I went and sat next to Miles. So I remember him saying something like, \"How are you doing?\" I said, \"Hi. All right.\" \"Yeah, you sure?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"You see anything good in here?\" I say, \"What?\" \"Anything, man. I\u0027m talking about do you see anything good?\" And I said, \"There\u0027s some nice ladies in here.\" \"That\u0027s right. That\u0027s right. You got a good eye.\"",
            "So I said, \"Yeah, I love your music.\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk about my music. I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" I said, \"OK.\" So then we had this general conversation. And then he went and got some food, came back, said to me, \"Later.\" And he left.",
            "So about two weeks later, I was walking down this--",
            "I was totally up for it. I had no fear in talking to him, I guess, maybe, because by this time, I was starting to get a little play myself, as a writer, in New York. I was starting to get some ink. And I had a kind of feeling about myself at that point. And so it was funny. We just kind of had this exchange. And then when he got ready to leave, he just left. He just left. But he came over to me and said, \"Later.\" So I thought it was some kind of indication that he liked the conversation or whatever.",
            "And so about three weeks later, I was walking down Broadway. And here he comes walking straight towards me. And I said, \"Oh, that\u0027s Miles Davis.\" So when he got up next to me, I said, \"Hey, Miles. How you doing?\" He walked right by me. Like I didn\u0027t even exist. Like I wasn\u0027t even on the planet. I mean, he didn\u0027t even nod, or nothing. He just walked right by me.",
            "And I stopped. I remember stopping, and I kind of looked back and said, \"Wow, was that Miles Davis?\" And it was. I said, \"Yeah, that\u0027s him. But he didn\u0027t speak.\" I said, \"Hey, Miles.\" And he didn\u0027t even turn around. He just kept going. So I said, \"Wow, that was kind of cold.\" I mean, that was kind of cold. It was like, I had never experienced that before in my life.",
            "And so when I got to know him, I finally got to know him real well, when I did the Spin Magazine. I did a two-part piece for Spin Magazine. And when I walked in his place, he looked at me and he kind of said, \"Yeah, sit down.\" So I sit down. And I remember him reaching out with his hand to grab my dreadlocks. And I hit his hand. Pow. And he said, \"What are you, crazy? What are you crazy, hitting me like that?\"",
            "I said, \"No, man.\" I said, \"Because I\u0027m over here to interview you doesn\u0027t mean that you have the right to invade my space.\" I said, \"Plus, the other times that I tried to talk to you, you just shined me on.\" He said, \"Oh, you mean the time out on the street? The time out on the street?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Man, I don\u0027t have to talk to you, man. I didn\u0027t have to talk to you. What you got to talk about this time?\"",
            "And that\u0027s the way it started. And we got to be the best of friends until he died. But Miles was always testing you. He was always testing you. He was the kind of guy-- and I loved him because he was always the kind of a guy that was always testing you. And if you passed the muster, if you could stand up to him, then if he liked you, he would bring you in. If you couldn\u0027t, he\u0027d just run over you, you know?",
            "You know, I got very up close with Miles. I mean, I was in his pocket and he was in my pocket for two and a half, three years. Until the time he died. I mean, I was really close to him. And so I saw flaws in his personality that-- because I think when you idolize a person like him-- like he was one of my heroes-- especially when you\u0027re young, you don\u0027t think they have flaws. You kind of see them through these rose-tinted glasses. And you kind of look at them as perfect.",
            "And so when I started to see some things that was not perfect about Miles, like his way of treating women and his way of treating other people sometimes and little small things, like cleanliness sometimes.",
            "Well, Miles was a clean person. In terms of his body and the way he dressed, but there were a couple of times when I went over his house one day-- I went over to his house one day, and it was a mess. I mean, stuff was everywhere. Clothes, toothbrush, toothpaste, music, trumpets.",
            "And I said, \"Miles, man,\" I said, \"Miles, you living like a pig, man.\" I said, \"You\u0027re living like a pig, man. This is a pigsty.\" He said, \"So what? So what? So what, it\u0027s a pigsty? What did you expect? I just play music, chump.\" He said, \"Somebody cleans it up. That\u0027s the deal.\"",
            "Well, I would see some of that. And first I would say, man this guy could be a pig, you know? But then, I got to the point where I said, no, he\u0027s just a human being. He\u0027s a human being. He has flaws. He plays beautiful music. But he had these little areas where he was just a human being, where he was flawed. Like, I never thought Miles would be as country as he was. You know, what I mean by country. I mean country-country, like a Southern-- instead of a jazz musician, when you got to know Miles, like some elegant jazz musician, Miles was like a country blues singer.",
            "When I was doing the book, and I was about three or four months in, when he started dropping the mask. And he\u0027d just drop the mask. And I\u0027d come by, and he\u0027d have food. And he\u0027d cook for me. And we\u0027d look at boxing matches and look at the basketball games. And at first, when I would go over there, he would always be dressed elegantly in very fashionable stuff. And then after that, he started dressing just really casually. And especially on the West Coast. When I\u0027d go up there, he\u0027d have on blue jeans, a torn sweater. And he would just cook. And we\u0027d just sit there and look and tell lies. And he\u0027d listen to the fights. And we\u0027d go for long walks on the beach. And he\u0027d take me for rides in his car.",
            "So it was just a beautiful kind of relationship. As a matter of fact, I told him, I said, \"You know, when you\u0027re in California, you\u0027re much different than you are in New York.\" And he said, \"Yeah.\" After a while, he acknowledged that. He said, \"Yeah, because in New York, I\u0027ve got to keep my mask up.\" I said, \"Yeah, that\u0027s right. You got to keep it up.\"",
            "Well, when I started to hear some of the stories. Because Miles was brutally honest. He was brutally honest when he did that book. I remember he was telling me the stories of him beating up these women and chasing his wife around the basement of their house with a knife and a gun. And so I started to think to myself, wow, this is ouch. I mean, this is a strange kind of situation, because I\u0027m just the opposite. I don\u0027t believe in hitting women. I don\u0027t believe in hitting anybody like that.",
            "But I figured out that Miles Davis was the kind of person-- he wasn\u0027t an intellectual, where he could respond and talk it out, talk the whole thing through. So if you got up in his face, whether you were a man or a woman, he would hit you. That was the way he was. I mean, he would hit you.",
            "I can be truthful and say I didn\u0027t like the way he did certain things. But then at the same time, we who knew him really well knew that he was a warm and generous person to us. And we\u0027d look at those things and say, hey man, that was kind of cold what he did there. But the way I looked at it, I\u0027d say, well, that\u0027s between him and that person.",
            "I never saw him hit a woman in front of me. Because you\u0027ve got to remember, I knew him from 1985 until he died, which was a period of six years. And so when he was in his most desperately insane period of really doing these kind of things to women, this was from 1968 to 1980, 12 years. And I didn\u0027t know him then. So I never saw that.",
            "When it would generally happen was when somebody would come up to me and say to me, \"Man, what is it like to be with Miles Davis? You know, I always wanted to be with Miles Davis.\" And then I would think, whoa.",
            "But for me, after it got to a certain level, I never thought about it. Because we just had this natural relationship. He\u0027d call me up or I\u0027d call him up.",
            "I remember telling somebody one time, Miles called me up from Japan. He had just taped this new thing. And he said, \"What do you think of this?\" And he put it on. And he played for about five minutes. And he said, \"What did you think?\" And I would tell him whether I liked it or I didn\u0027t. If I didn\u0027t like it, I would tell him I didn\u0027t like it. And I was relating this to somebody. And they said, \"You mean Miles Davis calls you up, and puts on the tape, and you listen to it?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Well, what\u0027s that like?\" I said, \"I guess it\u0027s like any one of my friends who is a poet, who will say \u0027listen to this poem,\u0027 you know what I mean? It just so happens it\u0027s Miles Davis\u0027 music, and he happens to be internationally famous.\"",
            "I remember one time, I was with him-- I can\u0027t remember the Japanese, it was not [? Miashi, ?] but it was another Japanese designer. And he had his clothes in New York. And he had his clothes, and he had Andy Warhol, before Andy Warhol died, and Miles Davis modeling as the star models of the clothes, along with all these beautiful, gorgeous women. So Miles called me and said, \"Do you want to go down with me?\" I said, \"Yeah, I\u0027ll go with you.\"",
            "So we go in this place called The Tunnel. It was some kind of a discotheque. So we\u0027re in there and they\u0027re modeling the clothes, and everybody\u0027s going out. Miles would walk out. Andy Warhol would walk out. So I\u0027m backstage with Andy. And these are two legends. These are two American icons in culture. So Miles was the finale. And he had this outfit with this gold lame cape that he was supposed to walk out, with a hat.",
            "So he started to walk out. And Andy was standing there looking at him. And the cape was dragging on the floor. So he started to walk out. And he turned around and looked at Andy Warhol. And he said, \"Andy, Andy. Pick up that cape.\" So Andy picked up the cape and they walked out together, you know what I mean? And Andy had this sheepish look on his face.",
            "And Miles strutted out, and Andy was holding the cape off the floor. And they walked up the thing. And so everybody in the room-- they left us in the room. Andy\u0027s handlers, they were like shocked. They had never heard anything like that. They were like, \"Wow, did you see that? Did you see that?\" But Andy was smiling. He was happy to be in it. He was happy to be in it.",
            "And so that was Miles. Miles Davis was almost like a king, you know what I mean? He was like a king. And so that particular moment, I remember his attitude was like, \"I\u0027m the king here. Pick up the cape. We both might be icons, but I\u0027m a bigger icon than you.\""

We had our glasses and everything on like he had his glasses on. And we kind of looked at him standing at the bar, smoking a cigarette, drinking a cognac. And from behind us someplace, I heard this voice say, \"Oh, darling, there\u0027s Miles Davis.\"",
            "But for me, after it got to a certain level, I never thought about it. Because we just had this natural relationship. He\u0027d call me up or I\u0027d call him up.",
            "You know, I got very up close with Miles. I mean, I was in his pocket and he was in my pocket for two and a half, three years. Until the time he died. I mean, I was really close to him. And so I saw flaws in his personality that-- because I think when you idolize a person like him-- like he was one of my heroes-- especially when you\u0027re young, you don\u0027t think they have flaws. You kind of see them through these rose-tinted glasses. And you kind of look at them as perfect.",
            "When it would generally happen was when somebody would come up to me and say to me, \"Man, what is it like to be with Miles Davis? You know, I always wanted to be with Miles Davis.\" And then I would think, whoa.",
            "But I figured out that Miles Davis was the kind of person-- he wasn\u0027t an intellectual, where he could respond and talk it out, talk the whole thing through. So if you got up in his face, whether you were a man or a woman, he would hit you. That was the way he was. I mean, he would hit you.",
            "And Miles strutted out, and Andy was holding the cape off the floor. And they walked up the thing. And so everybody in the room-- they left us in the room. Andy\u0027s handlers, they were like shocked. They had never heard anything like that. They were like, \"Wow, did you see that? Did you see that?\" But Andy was smiling. He was happy to be in it. He was happy to be in it.",
            "And I was like, \"Wow.\" That was stunning. I had never heard anybody talk to anyone like that, let alone an African-American man say that to a white guy. And I just said to myself, \"Man, this is something.\"",
            "I was totally up for it. I had no fear in talking to him, I guess, maybe, because by this time, I was starting to get a little play myself, as a writer, in New York. I was starting to get some ink. And I had a kind of feeling about myself at that point. And so it was funny. We just kind of had this exchange. And then when he got ready to leave, he just left. He just left. But he came over to me and said, \"Later.\" So I thought it was some kind of indication that he liked the conversation or whatever.",
            "And so about three weeks later, I was walking down Broadway. And here he comes walking straight towards me. And I said, \"Oh, that\u0027s Miles Davis.\" So when he got up next to me, I said, \"Hey, Miles. How you doing?\" He walked right by me. Like I didn\u0027t even exist. Like I wasn\u0027t even on the planet. I mean, he didn\u0027t even nod, or nothing. He just walked right by me.",
            "And I said, \"Miles, man,\" I said, \"Miles, you living like a pig, man.\" I said, \"You\u0027re living like a pig, man. This is a pigsty.\" He said, \"So what? So what? So what, it\u0027s a pigsty? What did you expect? I just play music, chump.\" He said, \"Somebody cleans it up. That\u0027s the deal.\"",
            "When I was doing the book, and I was about three or four months in, when he started dropping the mask. And he\u0027d just drop the mask. And I\u0027d come by, and he\u0027d have food. And he\u0027d cook for me. And we\u0027d look at boxing matches and look at the basketball games. And at first, when I would go over there, he would always be dressed elegantly in very fashionable stuff. And then after that, he started dressing just really casually. And especially on the West Coast. When I\u0027d go up there, he\u0027d have on blue jeans, a torn sweater. And he would just cook. And we\u0027d just sit there and look and tell lies. And he\u0027d listen to the fights. And we\u0027d go for long walks on the beach. And he\u0027d take me for rides in his car.",
            "So I go to Peacock Alley with some friends of mine. And we get in. The guy kind of looked at me and said, are you really-- because I was really young looking. But he let me in, finally. He just let me in. And when that band hit, they were so fantastic. They were so fantastic. And Miles was so clean. He was so clean and so hip that I was just mesmerized.",
            "Yes. I was living in New York. And my friend, Leo Maitland, who is now deceased, was a doctor. And he was Miles\u0027 doctor. And he used to always say to me, \"I know Miles Davis.\" I said, \"You got to introduce me to Miles. You got to introduce me to Miles.\"",
            "Well, when I started to hear some of the stories. Because Miles was brutally honest. He was brutally honest when he did that book. I remember he was telling me the stories of him beating up these women and chasing his wife around the basement of their house with a knife and a gun. And so I started to think to myself, wow, this is ouch. I mean, this is a strange kind of situation, because I\u0027m just the opposite. I don\u0027t believe in hitting women. I don\u0027t believe in hitting anybody like that.",
            "That\u0027s when I first heard Miles Davis. And then after that, my cousin told me how hip he was and showed me pictures of him and how clean he was. I started seeing how well he dressed and what great style he had.",
            "I remember one time, I was with him-- I can\u0027t remember the Japanese, it was not [? Miashi, ?] but it was another Japanese designer. And he had his clothes in New York. And he had his clothes, and he had Andy Warhol, before Andy Warhol died, and Miles Davis modeling as the star models of the clothes, along with all these beautiful, gorgeous women. So Miles called me and said, \"Do you want to go down with me?\" I said, \"Yeah, I\u0027ll go with you.\"",
            "I was in a fish-fry place. And I saw these four black guys sitting in this booth eating jack salmon sandwiches and dinners with dark glasses on and hats and their hair was conked and everything. So I thought they looked pretty hip. So I went and got my sandwich and sat behind them. And at that time, they were talking about this homeboy from East St. Louis. And he was in New York City, and he was doing all these great things and playing all this great music and had played with Charlie Parker. Who I didn\u0027t know any of this.",
            "So I remember the first time he came to St. Louis. There was all this big buzz about him coming to play there. And I had doctored up my draft card, and changed all the dates and everything, so I could be old enough to get into the club. And I remember going to the pawn shop and getting these great suits and these Church\u0027s shoes, which were too small for my feet. They were those really hip English shoes. And I had this big Chesterfield hat, and I was really clean. But my feet hurt. And my feet hurt because the shoes were too small. The shoes were too small.",
            "And so I told my cousin, who went with us, that I wanted to go up and say hello to Miles and tell him how much I loved his music. And so my cousin said, \"Quincy, don\u0027t go up and say nothing to Miles, because Miles doesn\u0027t talk to people. He doesn\u0027t like people coming up to him and talking to him. So don\u0027t go up to him and say anything. Just look at him from a distance.\"",
            "I said, \"No, man.\" I said, \"Because I\u0027m over here to interview you doesn\u0027t mean that you have the right to invade my space.\" I said, \"Plus, the other times that I tried to talk to you, you just shined me on.\" He said, \"Oh, you mean the time out on the street? The time out on the street?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Man, I don\u0027t have to talk to you, man. I didn\u0027t have to talk to you. What you got to talk about this time?\"",
            "So I said, \"Yeah, I love your music.\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk about my music. I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" I said, \"OK.\" So then we had this general conversation. And then he went and got some food, came back, said to me, \"Later.\" And he left.",
            "Well, I would see some of that. And first I would say, man this guy could be a pig, you know? But then, I got to the point where I said, no, he\u0027s just a human being. He\u0027s a human being. He has flaws. He plays beautiful music. But he had these little areas where he was just a human being, where he was flawed. Like, I never thought Miles would be as country as he was. You know, what I mean by country. I mean country-country, like a Southern-- instead of a jazz musician, when you got to know Miles, like some elegant jazz musician, Miles was like a country blues singer."
