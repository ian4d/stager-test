For Eustace, a big part of it was simply about horses. Eustace had been working with horses for a while when he sat out on the trail, but he knew there was just something about living with horses, working with horses, that he was going to learn if he rode so long, so steadily for months.","He took Judson, who had worked with horses on a ranch in Wyoming, he was a wrangler, took people on trips into the wilderness, plus an acquaintance of theirs, Susan Klimkowski, who worked for a couple years in a stable, had a horse of her own.

What made his decision so unsettling was that Larry used to be me. We lived in the same flat. We had the same friends. We were both writers. We wrote for the same magazines. For me, this life was a blessing. Larry said it was a torturous cycle of unfulfillable desire rotting him from the inside.","Larry has now been ordained as a monk. He\u0027s even taken a new zen name, Takado. It\u0027s been two years, but I still don\u0027t fully understand how he could have rejected our life in San Francisco. Larry picks me up at the airport while on an errand run for the Zen Center.","For what?","In his new life, Larry wakes up at 2:50 in the morning to make tea for the rest of the monks and students. From 3:00 AM, it\u0027s bowing, chanting, meditation, and meetings with the Japanese zen master until the afternoon. Then he\u0027s in charge of constructing a toilet building for the monastery. Then more chanting in the evening. The daily schedule ends at 9:00 at night. I have to admit that I take a bit of perverse pleasure in the fact that even though Larry has rejected the secular life, he still has to navigate Home Depot, trying to figure out which grade of sand he needs to buy.","Driving around the suburbs filling the pickup with supplies is like old times. We gossip about mutual friends, talk about this and that. But that evening in the monastery when we get together on one of his breaks, things get a little more tense. We have the same conversation we\u0027ve had a dozen times. I still want him to explain what\u0027s wrong with his old life, the life we shared. Here\u0027s what he says.","Did you see that about other people in San Francisco?","Yeah, like me. So what\u0027s the answer to my-- I mean, do you think I\u0027m-- of course, I\u0027m suffering, I guess. But it also seems balanced out by this remarkably joyful existence. I guess I don\u0027t see it as a torture.","My visit is a burden for him. He\u0027s fitting it in during short breaks between chores and meditation. I\u0027m cutting into his five hours of sleep. I follow as he goes to hit this big ceremonial piece of wood which signals the end of the day for the monastery. After he\u0027s finished whacking the wood, Larry and I climb up the hill behind the monastery.","Hey, this is nice. Wow.","What\u0027s that?","Yeah.","We sit down and talk.","I want to know what you missed about San Francisco when you first came here and what you miss now about it or whether that\u0027s changed or whether those things have dissipated. What did you miss about San Francisco when you first came?","When you say \"my friends, that\u0027s all,\" it seems like you\u0027re being sort of-- I guess, maybe, I took that as slightly dismissive of that. That\u0027s all. To leave your friends is a thing that I couldn\u0027t, right now, do.","I still miss you, I have to say.","Have you discovered in all this why you are so tortured-- I mean, why you are more tortured than, say, me? Although you claim to know that I\u0027m tortured as well. But you have to believe me.","Like what questions? What are we talking about?","The problem with this discussion is that we disagree on all the premises. Larry doesn\u0027t see any value in his old life, the life I\u0027m still leading. He thinks I\u0027m barely experiencing the world. I have the same doubts about his life. He says he\u0027s never felt more alive, but I see his move to the simple life of the monastery as a withdrawl from the world. It would be easier to be more accepting of his choice if he could be more accepting of my world view.","The fact is, Larry tried to simplify and clarify his life by coming here. But his life refused to be simplified. Shortly after he arrived at Mt. Baldy, he met a charming zen student named Katherine. Love affairs are discouraged at Mt. Baldy, so for over a year, Larry and Katherine had a mattress in the woods, and they would sneak away when they could.","When Larry decided that he couldn\u0027t fulfill his monk duties, study zen, and have a relationship with Katherine, she left the monastery. Larry\u0027s now decided that in a few months, after the toilet building is finished, he\u0027ll follow her. I feel vindicated that he\u0027s leaving. I\u0027m not proud of that.","Is it a possibility that you\u0027d come back to San Francisco?","Does it feel like a step back now?","So Larry and Katherine are going looking for another Zen community, a place that accepts couples.","Before I leave, I ask Larry to play some of his songs. Again, it\u0027s an experience where we disagree on every premise. I miss the times our friends would gather to hear him sing. I think it\u0027s a crime that he stopped writing his songs. Larry sees it differently. He calls them a catalog of his torture. But I make him sing a few for me. I want to get them on tape.

I don\u0027t know how much you want to tape. But let\u0027s just say one morning, I met these two guys. I was actually standing on the side of the road with a fan of money trying to get a ride. And they pull up to buy some beer, Sunday morning, actually.","Yeah. So this sporty little car pulls up with shiny mag wheels and comes to a stop right there at the quick stop across the road. And one of them goes in there to get something. I haven\u0027t met them at this time. So I\u0027m out there, and I kind of smile, hold my money up. And so apparently, J.L. was in the driver seat at this time. And he leans out of the car door and says, \"Hey, you got any money?\" And so I\u0027m embarrassed. I look around, I went, \"Yes.\"","\"I say, you got any money?\" And I think I better go negotiate with this man before I alarm the whole neighborhood. So I told him I\u0027d give him $5 just to get me to the other side of the town. Actually, I\u0027d gotten a ride halfway already. So I was trying just to get on the other side of town. So we\u0027re sitting there negotiating back and forth and back and forth. And Tyrone comes walking out. these two guys are buddies, J.L. and Tyrone. Tyrone comes walking out with this beer. And he just looks at me, he says, \"You want a ride?\"","And I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Get in the truck.\" So apparently, it was Tyrone\u0027s truck. So they crank it up and they start going along. And Tyrone pulls out a beer from his six pack. And he grabs that and he opens it. You can see the mist coming out. And he just looks at it, and he smells it, and he\u0027s just about to take a swig. He\u0027s reverently getting ready to drink his beer.","And he\u0027s just about to turn it back and drink, and he looks to me. All of a sudden, he remembers his manners. He\u0027s like, \"You like beer?\" I say, \"Uh huh.\" \"You want a beer?\" Being polite, I say, \"Well, sure, OK.\" So he gives me a beer. Then he cracks another one for himself. He says, \"I like beer. I love beer. I\u0027ll drink beer every day.\" So then he takes this big morning drink. It\u0027s like, whoa, this guy is into his beer.","So I\u0027m sitting there talking to J.L., hanging through the truck window. And he\u0027s telling me about his life. So he\u0027ll tell me something, and then I\u0027ll tell him something. I\u0027m telling him about the Long Riders journey. And I\u0027m telling him about the horses. Yeah, we got horses waiting over there. He\u0027s listening. At this time, I had no idea. But he thought I was full of [BLEEP]. He thought I was tripping on acid and had no idea that anything I was saying made any sense.","So we\u0027re having this conversation. And I think he\u0027s believing everything, so I\u0027m telling him about my life, my story.","You got it. You got the picture. So we get to the gas station. I fill them up with gas. Then we drive on. And so we come around the bend. He starts wondering if I even know where I want to go, like, if I\u0027m just crazy.","So we round the bend, and there is my partners with the horses. And J.L. is like, \"[BLEEP], man, they got horses! They got horses!\" He is just absolutely amazed. He throws the car into park and jumps out, leaves the door wide open, and just runs over to the horses and reaches out to touch them, as if, can they be real?","All of a sudden, everything shifts. Instead of being a freak, all of a sudden, he\u0027s got respect for me, and the reality comes in. And he wants to help out. Instead of trying to take my money-- here\u0027s how I met this guy. \"You got any money?\" He\u0027s trying hard as he can to take me for any kind of dollar bill. And all of a sudden, heart comes in. Feeling. Something totally shifts. And he cares about us. And so he comes out and meets us on the road several times, brings a friend. They drive the truck ahead a couple of days. And just such a shift from our introduction.","I guess I have my own way of thinking about it, is I wanted to tell people you can do whatever you want. Celebrate life. Don\u0027t just work at a grind forever. Just stop. Just say, \"I want to do this. That\u0027s what I did. I said I want to ride a horse across the country. I had a thousand people tell me I couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t listen to one of them. I said, I\u0027m going to do this. And I got on a horse and started out. I didn\u0027t know how to do this journey. I didn\u0027t know much about riding horses.","It does. People would even just ride up and roll down their window and stick out a $10 bill.","And then we started meeting the miles and meeting the challenges and being up at 2:00 in the morning fixing equipment and getting up before daylight. Some nights, we\u0027d sleep four hours, and we didn\u0027t go to bed refreshed. We went to bed worn out. We\u0027d get up four hours later and start feeding and brushing horses.","Oh, my. Very interesting situation. Almost embarrassing. But the fact is, we had just bought a horse. And this one hadn\u0027t been handled in a very long time and had a reputation, in the few times it had been handled, of being more or less wild. And so I\u0027m riding along, and we get to the Arizona line. Every time we get to a line, one of us-- usually Judson, my brother-- shoots off a gun, just as a celebration, reckoning that we made it to another state line.","So we go through the gate, and I shut the gate, and we\u0027re there. It\u0027s like, OK, let\u0027s celebrate. And intuitively, I knew not to get up on this horse. But my brother, for some reason, I don\u0027t know why, he said, get up on your horse. And for some reason, I followed his instructions and got up on the horse.","And I cracked my head. Blood everywhere. The power of it goes from my head to my shoulder, twisted my neck, hit my back, tearing my back open, ripping my shirt. And I\u0027m just sitting there slumped, hurting. And it was not what I wanted to happen.","I didn\u0027t take a minute off. I climbed back up, blood was still running down. The blood knitted my hair back together. That\u0027s what held my scalp together. I just let the dried blood hold it back together.","There weren\u0027t any doctors anywhere nearby. Oh, my. My brother and Susan are kind of like normal people. But my lifestyle has been forever very extraordinarily different than common, normal America. Just about a month ago, I rode a horse into a tree. I was chasing another horse. And it got dark, and I did not want to give up on catching this horse. It was the first time I\u0027d ever let this horse go.","So I ran right into a tree and knocked my head back. When I came forward, all of a sudden I heard all this splashing. Blood was flying all around my saddle splashing down. And I wondered, my gosh, what have I done? And I stuck my tongue through my lip. It was right through the front of my face. I was like, ooh, that does not feel right.","So I went to a mirror. See, I don\u0027t have electricity, so I lit some candles and looked in the mirror, and I had three huge holes in my face that were gaping open, profusely bleeding. So I could\u0027ve gone to a doctor. I live way out in the country. But I just got out a needle and thread and sewed my face back together. It was about 14 stitches. Pulled it back together and I was good to go. Had to heal up and the swelling had to go down and all that, but it\u0027s healed up real good.","But see, that\u0027s the story of my life. Me, what I\u0027m trying to teach people and what I believe in is that you can do things yourself. You can take care of yourself. You can be responsible, and should be responsible, for yourself.

All of a sudden, he remembers his manners. He\u0027s like, \"You like beer?\" I say, \"Uh huh.\" \"You want a beer?\" Being polite, I say, \"Well, sure, OK.\" So he gives me a beer. Then he cracks another one for himself. He says, \"I like beer. I love beer. I\u0027ll drink beer every day.\" So then he takes this big morning drink. It\u0027s like, whoa, this guy is into his beer.","There weren\u0027t any doctors anywhere nearby. Oh, my. My brother and Susan are kind of like normal people. But my lifestyle has been forever very extraordinarily different than common, normal America. Just about a month ago, I rode a horse into a tree. I was chasing another horse. And it got dark, and I did not want to give up on catching this horse. It was the first time I\u0027d ever let this horse go.","We were. Yeah.","Long story. I don\u0027t know how much you want to tape. But let\u0027s just say one morning, I met these two guys. I was actually standing on the side of the road with a fan of money trying to get a ride. And they pull up to buy some beer, Sunday morning, actually.","I didn\u0027t take a minute off. I climbed back up, blood was still running down. The blood knitted my hair back together. That\u0027s what held my scalp together. I just let the dried blood hold it back together.","Yeah. So this sporty little car pulls up with shiny mag wheels and comes to a stop right there at the quick stop across the road. And one of them goes in there to get something. I haven\u0027t met them at this time. So I\u0027m out there, and I kind of smile, hold my money up. And so apparently, J.L. was in the driver seat at this time. And he leans out of the car door and says, \"Hey, you got any money?\" And so I\u0027m embarrassed. I look around, I went, \"Yes.\"","\"I say, you got any money?\" And I think I better go negotiate with this man before I alarm the whole neighborhood. So I told him I\u0027d give him $5 just to get me to the other side of the town. Actually, I\u0027d gotten a ride halfway already. So I was trying just to get on the other side of town. So we\u0027re sitting there negotiating back and forth and back and forth. And Tyrone comes walking out. these two guys are buddies, J.L. and Tyrone. Tyrone comes walking out with this beer. And he just looks at me, he says, \"You want a ride?\"","We had a few state road maps. A few state road maps is all we had to go by. And everybody kept saying, well, what\u0027s your route? How are you going to go? And I was like, I don\u0027t really know. We\u0027re heading west every day.","I guess I have my own way of thinking about it, is I wanted to tell people you can do whatever you want. Celebrate life. Don\u0027t just work at a grind forever. Just stop. Just say, \"I want to do this. That\u0027s what I did. I said I want to ride a horse across the country. I had a thousand people tell me I couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t listen to one of them. I said, I\u0027m going to do this. And I got on a horse and started out. I didn\u0027t know how to do this journey. I didn\u0027t know much about riding horses.","We just stood there. Just stood there looking at it, unbelieving that we had gotten there. And looking around and, is this really sand under our feet? Are those really waves there? It was like if you could just scream \"wow\" and let it echo for a couple of hours. Wow, wow, wow.","So I see the man just grab something from his desk and run out the front door. So I look back every once in a while, and this guy is sort of half-running behind us. Finally, we get to the edge of town. It\u0027s misting, a bit rainy. And he says, \"Hey, I didn\u0027t want to interrupt you. I thought you might be making a movie or something.\" It\u0027s like, \"No, we\u0027re not making a movie.\"","You got it. You got the picture. So we get to the gas station. I fill them up with gas. Then we drive on. And so we come around the bend. He starts wondering if I even know where I want to go, like, if I\u0027m just crazy.","We knew almost nothing about this. We didn\u0027t know what we were doing. Even finding a route, like how were we going to go across.","And he says, \"But you guys look so real. I mean, you really look real.\" And I was like, \"Well, I think that probably is because we really are real.\" And he said this over and another. It was like he was stuttering this chant, like, \"You guys look real. I mean, you really look real.\"","And I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Get in the truck.\" So apparently, it was Tyrone\u0027s truck. So they crank it up and they start going along. And Tyrone pulls out a beer from his six pack. And he grabs that and he opens it. You can see the mist coming out. And he just looks at it, and he smells it, and he\u0027s just about to take a swig. He\u0027s reverently getting ready to drink his beer.","So we round the bend, and there is my partners with the horses. And J.L. is like, \"[BLEEP], man, they got horses! They got horses!\" He is just absolutely amazed. He throws the car into park and jumps out, leaves the door wide open, and just runs over to the horses and reaches out to touch them, as if, can they be real?","All of a sudden, everything shifts. Instead of being a freak, all of a sudden, he\u0027s got respect for me, and the reality comes in. And he wants to help out. Instead of trying to take my money-- here\u0027s how I met this guy. \"You got any money?\" He\u0027s trying hard as he can to take me for any kind of dollar bill. And all of a sudden, heart comes in. Feeling. Something totally shifts. And he cares about us. And so he comes out and meets us on the road several times, brings a friend. They drive the truck ahead a couple of days. And just such a shift from our introduction.","And then we started meeting the miles and meeting the challenges and being up at 2:00 in the morning fixing equipment and getting up before daylight. Some nights, we\u0027d sleep four hours, and we didn\u0027t go to bed refreshed. We went to bed worn out. We\u0027d get up four hours later and start feeding and brushing horses.","Oh, it was easy setting out. It was sort of like, OK, the day has come. We\u0027re going. I knew that we didn\u0027t know what we were doing. That was OK. I was real satisfied with that. I personally knew that there was a big chance that we wouldn\u0027t make it. My partners were a little bit younger and had done less traveling, a little bit more idealistic. And so they were Gung ho. Yeah, we\u0027re going to do this thing. We\u0027re going to make it.","So I went to a mirror. See, I don\u0027t have electricity, so I lit some candles and looked in the mirror, and I had three huge holes in my face that were gaping open, profusely bleeding. So I could\u0027ve gone to a doctor. I live way out in the country. But I just got out a needle and thread and sewed my face back together. It was about 14 stitches. Pulled it back together and I was good to go. Had to heal up and the swelling had to go down and all that, but it\u0027s healed up real good.","It does. People would even just ride up and roll down their window and stick out a $10 bill.","And I cracked my head. Blood everywhere. The power of it goes from my head to my shoulder, twisted my neck, hit my back, tearing my back open, ripping my shirt. And I\u0027m just sitting there slumped, hurting. And it was not what I wanted to happen."]},"Ira Glass":{"name":"Ira Glass","episodes":{"111":"Adventures in the Simple Life"},"statements":["Act One, Long Riders. So when they set out, it was Eustace, Judson and Susan, four horses, one was a spare, camping gear, and a truck. And it\u0027s kind of a crazy scheme the way that they worked the whole thing. Every day, they would wake up, and then one of the would drive the truck 20 or 30 miles ahead to wherever it was they were going to camp the next night. And then that person would have to hitchhike back the same 20 or 30 miles, which could take hours.","And then, after that, they would set out on their horses and they would ride all day. A couple months into the trip, they had this guy named Walker Young who joined the team to drive the truck ahead and find places to camp and handle stuff like that. The other crazy 20th century adaptation to their 19th century horse ride is it they did not ride through open country. They trotted along on the shoulders of highways, on the sides of roads. It seemed like the most efficient route.","You recorded yourselves as you rode across the country on a cassette machine, about 30 hours of tape, starting with that first day.

Right.","When they\u0027d ride into town, they\u0027d try to find somebody with a fenced-in field or yard, and they would ask them if they could camp there. And over and over, people not only said yes, they invited them in for hot meals and hot showers, helped them out any way they could. There was this one family in Louisiana, the Marbles, who, after putting up Eustace and Judson and Susan for days, really, helping them find a new horse, decided to deliver them a hot turkey meal with stuffing and cranberry dressing and all the fixings out on the road.","And they had driven hundreds of miles?","Judson, why do you think people were responding the way they were to the three of you traveling?","It sounds like the three of you are just out there just like putting your hearts out there. You know what I mean? Just doing this thing. And so that just calls this thing forward from other people where they want to do it too.","Part of this reaction had to do with the horses, Eustace and Judson say. They had both hitchhiked across America, and they say that people are not nearly so friendly. But with the horses, they would ride into town, looking like cowboys, charming and dusty, like figures not just out of a the movie but out of some dream that we all have of America.","When these epic figures trot up the interstate into your town, how could you not stare? Who would not want to be near something so larger than life. People didn\u0027t just give them money. People wanted to talk to them, tell them their stories, which Eustace recorded on tape.","Coming up, The Dark Side of the Horse, in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues.","It\u0027s This American.

I cannot state strongly enough how much of the 30 hours of tape they recorded is simply the three of them talking about the horses. Hours of detail about the horses\u0027 shoes and the color of their urine, and how the horses are doing. And I have to say, for city people sitting in an office in Chicago, listening to all this, it was hard to understand what it was all about. But, of course, what it was all about was the difficulty of being on the road, which is where our story resumes.","Let me ask you to explain as you\u0027re going into Arizona.","How much of a break did you take before you started writing again? Did you take the--","Did you think about seeing a doctor?","Even when you embark on an adventure in the simple life, it doesn\u0027t get all that simple. Life resists simplicity.

And then having to provision horses and get new horses and find a place to stay every night. It took money and telephones and all the skill with people that anybody would be able to muster.","And then there\u0027s the mundane fact that like any people on a long trip together, Eustace and Judson and Susan got on each other\u0027s nerves sometimes. When it happened, one of them would ride ahead a ways for a while, get a break from the others.

What did you all look like?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We were basically wearing a lot of the Western-style clothes, which wasn\u0027t for style but all these old cowboy clothes, they actually work. They do the things that you need. Silk scarves, cowboy hats."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"The chaps and the spurs and the whole bit."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"--had guns and knives and long hair and looked rough as hell and all kinds of stories, interesting reactions coming out of that. Well, here\u0027s a good description. Here\u0027s a story. We\u0027re trotting through this little town and going down Main Street, and I see someone through a plate glass window look at us. And they\u0027re sort of awed. The mouth drops open, it\u0027s like, my gosh, what\u0027s going on here?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I see the man just grab something from his desk and run out the front door. So I look back every once in a while, and this guy is sort of half-running behind us. Finally, we get to the edge of town. It\u0027s misting, a bit rainy. And he says, \"Hey, I didn\u0027t want to interrupt you. I thought you might be making a movie or something.\" It\u0027s like, \"No, we\u0027re not making a movie.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And he says, \"But you guys look so real. I mean, you really look real.\" And I was like, \"Well, I think that probably is because we really are real.\" And he said this over and another. It was like he was stuttering this chant, like, \"You guys look real. I mean, you really look real.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"And now-- I\u0027m glad the tape recorder\u0027s working-- now Judson\u0027s going to fire off a round to celebrate making it across a whole state in the Southeast Georgia. We just entered Alabama. Do it, brother!"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[FIRES GUN]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Whew! Oh, my god."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Let me ask you to talk about some of the people you met along the way."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Uh huh. Where would I begin? That\u0027s the most amazing part of the entire journey."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"People would really appreciate and take us in in ways that I never imagined would be possible. You know, these odd-looking rogues with long hair, knives and guns, and yet, the most conservative, Southern, clean-cut gentleman, farmers, would bring us right into their homes with their children, their wives, and just treat us like we were part of the family."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"The entire America was great. They were most gracious and accepted us. And we\u0027d go into one town and they\u0027d say, oh, watch out for this next town that you\u0027re going through because they\u0027re kind of questionable people. And we\u0027d get to that town and they\u0027d be just as nice as the last one. Everybody was great."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Long story. I don\u0027t know how much you want to tape. But let\u0027s just say one morning, I met these two guys. I was actually standing on the side of the road with a fan of money trying to get a ride. And they pull up to buy some beer, Sunday morning, actually."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"On their way to church."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Yeah. So this sporty little car pulls up with shiny mag wheels and comes to a stop right there at the quick stop across the road. And one of them goes in there to get something. I haven\u0027t met them at this time. So I\u0027m out there, and I kind of smile, hold my money up. And so apparently, J.L. was in the driver seat at this time. And he leans out of the car door and says, \"Hey, you got any money?\" And so I\u0027m embarrassed. I look around, I went, \"Yes.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"\"I say, you got any money?\" And I think I better go negotiate with this man before I alarm the whole neighborhood. So I told him I\u0027d give him $5 just to get me to the other side of the town. Actually, I\u0027d gotten a ride halfway already. So I was trying just to get on the other side of town. So we\u0027re sitting there negotiating back and forth and back and forth. And Tyrone comes walking out. these two guys are buddies, J.L. and Tyrone. Tyrone comes walking out with this beer. And he just looks at me, he says, \"You want a ride?\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Get in the truck.\" So apparently, it was Tyrone\u0027s truck. So they crank it up and they start going along. And Tyrone pulls out a beer from his six pack. And he grabs that and he opens it. You can see the mist coming out. And he just looks at it, and he smells it, and he\u0027s just about to take a swig. He\u0027s reverently getting ready to drink his beer."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And he\u0027s just about to turn it back and drink, and he looks to me. All of a sudden, he remembers his manners. He\u0027s like, \"You like beer?\" I say, \"Uh huh.\" \"You want a beer?\" Being polite, I say, \"Well, sure, OK.\" So he gives me a beer. Then he cracks another one for himself. He says, \"I like beer. I love beer. I\u0027ll drink beer every day.\" So then he takes this big morning drink. It\u0027s like, whoa, this guy is into his beer."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I\u0027m sitting there talking to J.L., hanging through the truck window. And he\u0027s telling me about his life. So he\u0027ll tell me something, and then I\u0027ll tell him something. I\u0027m telling him about the Long Riders journey. And I\u0027m telling him about the horses. Yeah, we got horses waiting over there. He\u0027s listening. At this time, I had no idea. But he thought I was full of [BLEEP]. He thought I was tripping on acid and had no idea that anything I was saying made any sense."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So we\u0027re having this conversation. And I think he\u0027s believing everything, so I\u0027m telling him about my life, my story."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You\u0027re telling him your life, so you\u0027re telling him, \"I live in the woods. I\u0027ve lived there since I was a teenager. I trap my own animals.\" And he\u0027s just thinking, yeah right."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"You got it. You got the picture. So we get to the gas station. I fill them up with gas. Then we drive on. And so we come around the bend. He starts wondering if I even know where I want to go, like, if I\u0027m just crazy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Making the whole thing up. Right."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So we round the bend, and there is my partners with the horses. And J.L. is like, \"[BLEEP], man, they got horses! They got horses!\" He is just absolutely amazed. He throws the car into park and jumps out, leaves the door wide open, and just runs over to the horses and reaches out to touch them, as if, can they be real?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"All of a sudden, everything shifts. Instead of being a freak, all of a sudden, he\u0027s got respect for me, and the reality comes in. And he wants to help out. Instead of trying to take my money-- here\u0027s how I met this guy. \"You got any money?\" He\u0027s trying hard as he can to take me for any kind of dollar bill. And all of a sudden, heart comes in. Feeling. Something totally shifts. And he cares about us. And so he comes out and meets us on the road several times, brings a friend. They drive the truck ahead a couple of days. And just such a shift from our introduction."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When they\u0027d ride into town, they\u0027d try to find somebody with a fenced-in field or yard, and they would ask them if they could camp there. And over and over, people not only said yes, they invited them in for hot meals and hot showers, helped them out any way they could. There was this one family in Louisiana, the Marbles, who, after putting up Eustace and Judson and Susan for days, really, helping them find a new horse, decided to deliver them a hot turkey meal with stuffing and cranberry dressing and all the fixings out on the road."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"We were riding down the road several hundred miles from where they live. And all of a sudden, they drive by hooting and hollering out the window. My gosh, is that the Marbles? And they pulled over ahead of us and by the time we got to them, they had a big old Thanksgiving dinner is what I called it, even though it was January or February."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And they had driven hundreds of miles?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Yeah, and they had no idea exactly where we were. They was just in a hope that they could find us. All the cooking, all the driving, all the planning to have that Sunday afternoon to come try to find us. And they did."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Judson, why do you think people were responding the way they were to the three of you traveling?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Because we were doing something that everybody dreams about but nobody takes the risk to do-- or the time, the energy, the money, the challenge to do."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"I guess I have my own way of thinking about it, is I wanted to tell people you can do whatever you want. Celebrate life. Don\u0027t just work at a grind forever. Just stop. Just say, \"I want to do this. That\u0027s what I did. I said I want to ride a horse across the country. I had a thousand people tell me I couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t listen to one of them. I said, I\u0027m going to do this. And I got on a horse and started out. I didn\u0027t know how to do this journey. I didn\u0027t know much about riding horses."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It sounds like the three of you are just out there just like putting your hearts out there. You know what I mean? Just doing this thing. And so that just calls this thing forward from other people where they want to do it too."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"It does. People would even just ride up and roll down their window and stick out a $10 bill."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Several times, we would turn people down. People were like, \"Let me help you. You can stay at our house.\" And we\u0027re like, \"Well, we\u0027ve already got plans. Somebody already pulled over and invited us to stay their house.\" And several times, we split up, and one of us would spend the night one place and somebody else would spend the night somewhere else."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Part of this reaction had to do with the horses, Eustace and Judson say. They had both hitchhiked across America, and they say that people are not nearly so friendly. But with the horses, they would ride into town, looking like cowboys, charming and dusty, like figures not just out of a the movie but out of some dream that we all have of America."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When these epic figures trot up the interstate into your town, how could you not stare? Who would not want to be near something so larger than life. People didn\u0027t just give them money. People wanted to talk to them, tell them their stories, which Eustace recorded on tape."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Allison, tell our diary what\u0027s going on. What do you do for a living? Where are we? And anything you want to say?"},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"We\u0027re at a rock shop out in the middle of nowhere. In fact, we\u0027re three miles from the middle of nowhere. Mile marker 33 is the middle. We just kind of poke along out here. And this used to be owned by Sam and Vera Jones."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Sam was otherwise known as Rattlesnake Jones. He believed in protecting rattlesnakes. He had a rattlesnake pit out here with over 200 rattlesnakes in it at all times. Him and Vera also had two pet bobcats. And a lot of neat history out here."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Sam killed himself on the front doorstep over there of the trailer because he was dying of cancer and all sorts of health problems. He was living on a hospital bed on an oxygen tank. And he told his wife that he was going shoot himself that morning. And she said as long as he didn\u0027t do it inside the house. She didn\u0027t want to clean up the mess. And she knew he was serious. And she was out in the rock shop and heard the gunshot and waited about an hour before she called the ambulance because he didn\u0027t want to be resuscitated. He wanted to be dead."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"My goodness."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Yeah, it\u0027s real interesting out here."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"My dad was a bird hunter. And we had three or four milk cows. My sister and brothers, they\u0027d milk the cows. I\u0027d feed the horse. My dad would feed the mules. He would pass through the rooms, say, get up, boys."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Get up, boys."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"And look, he wasn\u0027t going to say \"get up boys\" but one time. And the next time, he\u0027d say, I thought you boys were supposed to be up. The next time, he had that broom handle. And ain\u0027t no such a thing as child abuse."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"The first time is when he wanted it to be done."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"And you better get out the bed, because let I\u0027m going to tell you something. My daddy didn\u0027t play. 270 pounds of pure man."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"I heard that."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"6:00 in the morning here. Just got up. Stars are bright. I\u0027m going to go check on the horses here and give them their feed as early as possible so that they\u0027ll have time to digest it before we head out. Hello there, boys. Hello, boys. Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"It\u0027s hard to imagine, now that I really think about it, how a camera crew or even a news team of writers could capture what I think is best about this trip-- the movement, the familiarity with the known, the process of the day, the challenge, the freshness, the warmth of the simplicity, the support of the people like the ones in that car that waved as they just went by, the pattern of day-by-day moving as a herd across North America. There\u0027s no way that they could capture what I really want to share."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Beautiful, quiet night. No light except the stars. The Big Dipper shining bright and pointing out to the North Star. We made it 30 miles, so I feel really good. Glad to be with my good partners, good horses. Good."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Coming up, The Dark Side of the Horse, in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s This American. Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Adventures in the Simple Life."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We\u0027re in the middle of Act One, the story of three people traveling across country with some horses and a tape recorder-- prerequisite for getting on our show. I cannot state strongly enough how much of the 30 hours of tape they recorded is simply the three of them talking about the horses. Hours of detail about the horses\u0027 shoes and the color of their urine, and how the horses are doing. And I have to say, for city people sitting in an office in Chicago, listening to all this, it was hard to understand what it was all about. But, of course, what it was all about was the difficulty of being on the road, which is where our story resumes."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And then we started meeting the miles and meeting the challenges and being up at 2:00 in the morning fixing equipment and getting up before daylight. Some nights, we\u0027d sleep four hours, and we didn\u0027t go to bed refreshed. We went to bed worn out. We\u0027d get up four hours later and start feeding and brushing horses."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"So it\u0027s pouring rain, and we\u0027re stopped by a little, metal building on the side of the road. And we pulled over and one of Mac\u0027s shoes, I noticed his back, left shoe was falling off. What in the hell are we going to do? Oh, jeez."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"8:30 in the morning on March-- what is today, everybody?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"15th."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"15th?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski On Tape","text":"[INAUDIBLE]."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"And I feel puny. My stomach is just feeling like a burnt pancake that got stepped on by an elephant and then eaten by a roadrunner and then [BLEEP] on top of a green stinkbug that\u0027s eating its way through it. And that\u0027s how my stomach feels. I might just vomit in this microphone."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Turning right on a dirt road. And Judson\u0027s reaching for his six shooter. What\u0027s that boy doing? Oh my gosh, we\u0027re crossing into Arkansas. Oh, my gosh."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[YELPS AND FIRES GUN]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Oh, my goodness! We made it to Arkansas! [YELPS]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Are we really here, or is it just a dream? I think we\u0027re about to touch Texas. And there\u0027s a big old rock there that says \"Texas.\" Oh my gosh, it\u0027s real. We\u0027re really doing it."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"[GUN FIRES]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Yes! [YELPS] Albert, settle down, boy. It\u0027s just a .357."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Let me ask you to explain as you\u0027re going into Arizona."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Oh, my. Very interesting situation. Almost embarrassing. But the fact is, we had just bought a horse. And this one hadn\u0027t been handled in a very long time and had a reputation, in the few times it had been handled, of being more or less wild. And so I\u0027m riding along, and we get to the Arizona line. Every time we get to a line, one of us-- usually Judson, my brother-- shoots off a gun, just as a celebration, reckoning that we made it to another state line."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So we go through the gate, and I shut the gate, and we\u0027re there. It\u0027s like, OK, let\u0027s celebrate. And intuitively, I knew not to get up on this horse. But my brother, for some reason, I don\u0027t know why, he said, get up on your horse. And for some reason, I followed his instructions and got up on the horse."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"There it is, boy. It\u0027s the state line. We\u0027re getting ready for a big bang. My gosh, we\u0027re getting into Arizona. Woo! We are walking in the soul of another state, and proud of it."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[SHOOTS GUN] [YELPS]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"I got bucked off of this damn black horse. He\u0027s not used to a gunshot. Guess I\u0027m trying to stay awake now. Seems like maybe my head is addled. Maybe I have a concussion or something."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And I cracked my head. Blood everywhere. The power of it goes from my head to my shoulder, twisted my neck, hit my back, tearing my back open, ripping my shirt. And I\u0027m just sitting there slumped, hurting. And it was not what I wanted to happen."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How much of a break did you take before you started writing again? Did you take the--"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"I didn\u0027t take a minute off. I climbed back up, blood was still running down. The blood knitted my hair back together. That\u0027s what held my scalp together. I just let the dried blood hold it back together."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you think about seeing a doctor?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"There weren\u0027t any doctors anywhere nearby. Oh, my. My brother and Susan are kind of like normal people. But my lifestyle has been forever very extraordinarily different than common, normal America. Just about a month ago, I rode a horse into a tree. I was chasing another horse. And it got dark, and I did not want to give up on catching this horse. It was the first time I\u0027d ever let this horse go."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I ran right into a tree and knocked my head back. When I came forward, all of a sudden I heard all this splashing. Blood was flying all around my saddle splashing down. And I wondered, my gosh, what have I done? And I stuck my tongue through my lip. It was right through the front of my face. I was like, ooh, that does not feel right."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I went to a mirror. See, I don\u0027t have electricity, so I lit some candles and looked in the mirror, and I had three huge holes in my face that were gaping open, profusely bleeding. So I could\u0027ve gone to a doctor. I live way out in the country. But I just got out a needle and thread and sewed my face back together. It was about 14 stitches. Pulled it back together and I was good to go. Had to heal up and the swelling had to go down and all that, but it\u0027s healed up real good."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"But see, that\u0027s the story of my life. Me, what I\u0027m trying to teach people and what I believe in is that you can do things yourself. You can take care of yourself. You can be responsible, and should be responsible, for yourself. I was born in normal suburbia. In fact, I guess that\u0027s one of the important things about me being able to do some of these things of living like people did a long time ago, is I went from normal suburbia. I know the American people. I can speak your language. But I live in a very different way that\u0027s come through decades of experience and voluntarily living by a whole other set of values and reality."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Even when you embark on an adventure in the simple life, it doesn\u0027t get all that simple. Life resists simplicity. On this horse trip across America, the logistics of getting from place to place were as complicated as you might imagine, with that truck to move around and 20th century traffic always threatening to run them over. And then having to provision horses and get new horses and find a place to stay every night. It took money and telephones and all the skill with people that anybody would be able to muster."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then there\u0027s the mundane fact that like any people on a long trip together, Eustace and Judson and Susan got on each other\u0027s nerves sometimes. When it happened, one of them would ride ahead a ways for a while, get a break from the others. And when they finally made it to California, to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, what\u0027s striking is how bittersweet it was."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"That was a pretty intense day. We started riding. And that part of California is very hilly. And you\u0027d ride up a hill and you think, we\u0027re going to look out and see the ocean. And we didn\u0027t. We rode and rode and rode before we saw the ocean. And you\u0027re just hoping and waiting for this end. It\u0027s kind of climactic, waiting for it to come up, and it never would. You\u0027d just see more houses and more streets. It was like, \"ugh.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Almost at the beach. I can smell it and feel it and see it in the traffic and the worry in the people faces. And it\u0027s exciting because we\u0027re almost there."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Hey, cowboys!"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"We are cowboys. Hey, cowboys! That\u0027s what they call us here."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"And finally, we saw it. And it was like, wow. It was a weird feeling. It was like, now what do we do?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"I thought it was going to be more crazy energy. It was more self-reflective energy. It was more just sitting on your horse and staring at the ocean and going, wow. It was more just, we did it. And in the hot days of Arizona, somehow, I was just going, man, if I get to that ocean, I\u0027m going to get off and just go running, dive in the water and swim out as far as I can. And all that crazy excitement didn\u0027t happen. It was more just a silent stare."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We just stood there. Just stood there looking at it, unbelieving that we had gotten there. And looking around and, is this really sand under our feet? Are those really waves there? It was like if you could just scream \"wow\" and let it echo for a couple of hours. Wow, wow, wow."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What do you carry back into your everyday life from a journey like this? Eustace is back living in the woods, having learned what he said he wanted to learn about horses on the trip. Judson\u0027s a fly fishing guide in North Carolina, starting his own business doing that. And Susan\u0027s the one who set to make the biggest transition, back to modern life, indoor life. She moved to Oklahoma to be closer to her grandfather, who\u0027s been ill."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What\u0027s your job now? What are you doing?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"I\u0027m an order selector at a local warehouse here. It\u0027s Associated Wholesale Grocers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And so what\u0027s that\u0027s like to go to a job like that after having been on the road for months?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"It\u0027s pretty crazy. We work hard every day. It\u0027s a pretty labor-intensive job. And it\u0027s interesting to look at the perspectives of my fellow employees and how this is their life, and this is what they do. And I kind of see past it, and I see what I\u0027ve done and that there\u0027s so much more out there."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you find you talk about it a lot now, months later?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"A little bit. Not a whole lot. I\u0027m living in Oklahoma and don\u0027t know a whole lot of people. And if I tell them that I rode my horse across country, I don\u0027t think they\u0027d believe me.

For me, this life was a blessing. Larry said it was a torturous cycle of unfulfillable desire rotting him from the inside.","Larry has now been ordained as a monk. He\u0027s even taken a new zen name, Takado. It\u0027s been two years, but I still don\u0027t fully understand how he could have rejected our life in San Francisco. Larry picks me up at the airport while on an errand run for the Zen Center.","For what?","In his new life, Larry wakes up at 2:50 in the morning to make tea for the rest of the monks and students. From 3:00 AM, it\u0027s bowing, chanting, meditation, and meetings with the Japanese zen master until the afternoon. Then he\u0027s in charge of constructing a toilet building for the monastery. Then more chanting in the evening. The daily schedule ends at 9:00 at night. I have to admit that I take a bit of perverse pleasure in the fact that even though Larry has rejected the secular life, he still has to navigate Home Depot, trying to figure out which grade of sand he needs to buy.","Driving around the suburbs filling the pickup with supplies is like old times. We gossip about mutual friends, talk about this and that. But that evening in the monastery when we get together on one of his breaks, things get a little more tense. We have the same conversation we\u0027ve had a dozen times. I still want him to explain what\u0027s wrong with his old life, the life we shared. Here\u0027s what he says.","Did you see that about other people in San Francisco?","Yeah, like me. So what\u0027s the answer to my-- I mean, do you think I\u0027m-- of course, I\u0027m suffering, I guess. But it also seems balanced out by this remarkably joyful existence. I guess I don\u0027t see it as a torture.","My visit is a burden for him. He\u0027s fitting it in during short breaks between chores and meditation. I\u0027m cutting into his five hours of sleep. I follow as he goes to hit this big ceremonial piece of wood which signals the end of the day for the monastery. After he\u0027s finished whacking the wood, Larry and I climb up the hill behind the monastery.","Hey, this is nice. Wow.","What\u0027s that?","Yeah.","We sit down and talk.","I want to know what you missed about San Francisco when you first came here and what you miss now about it or whether that\u0027s changed or whether those things have dissipated. What did you miss about San Francisco when you first came?","When you say \"my friends, that\u0027s all,\" it seems like you\u0027re being sort of-- I guess, maybe, I took that as slightly dismissive of that. That\u0027s all. To leave your friends is a thing that I couldn\u0027t, right now, do.","I still miss you, I have to say.","Have you discovered in all this why you are so tortured-- I mean, why you are more tortured than, say, me? Although you claim to know that I\u0027m tortured as well. But you have to believe me.","Like what questions? What are we talking about?","The problem with this discussion is that we disagree on all the premises. Larry doesn\u0027t see any value in his old life, the life I\u0027m still leading. He thinks I\u0027m barely experiencing the world. I have the same doubts about his life. He says he\u0027s never felt more alive, but I see his move to the simple life of the monastery as a withdrawl from the world. It would be easier to be more accepting of his choice if he could be more accepting of my world view.","The fact is, Larry tried to simplify and clarify his life by coming here. But his life refused to be simplified. Shortly after he arrived at Mt. Baldy, he met a charming zen student named Katherine. Love affairs are discouraged at Mt. Baldy, so for over a year, Larry and Katherine had a mattress in the woods, and they would sneak away when they could.","When Larry decided that he couldn\u0027t fulfill his monk duties, study zen, and have a relationship with Katherine, she left the monastery. Larry\u0027s now decided that in a few months, after the toilet building is finished, he\u0027ll follow her. I feel vindicated that he\u0027s leaving. I\u0027m not proud of that.","Is it a possibility that you\u0027d come back to San Francisco?","Does it feel like a step back now?","So Larry and Katherine are going looking for another Zen community, a place that accepts couples.","Before I leave, I ask Larry to play some of his songs. Again, it\u0027s an experience where we disagree on every premise. I miss the times our friends would gather to hear him sing. I think it\u0027s a crime that he stopped writing his songs. Larry sees it differently. He calls them a catalog of his torture. But I make him sing a few for me. I want to get them on tape.

What made his decision so unsettling was that Larry used to be me. We lived in the same flat. We had the same friends. We were both writers. We wrote for the same magazines. For me, this life was a blessing. Larry said it was a torturous cycle of unfulfillable desire rotting him from the inside."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Larry has now been ordained as a monk. He\u0027s even taken a new zen name, Takado. It\u0027s been two years, but I still don\u0027t fully understand how he could have rejected our life in San Francisco. Larry picks me up at the airport while on an errand run for the Zen Center."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Here\u0027s what we have to do. We have to go Home Depot and buy a lot of things that I\u0027m not so sure about. So we\u0027ll have to figure a lot of things out in Home Depot. And then we have to find this dry cleaners place that I think is on Central or Monte Vista."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"For what?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"To bring a bowing mat that somebody spilled wax on. And then we have to go to--"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"In his new life, Larry wakes up at 2:50 in the morning to make tea for the rest of the monks and students. From 3:00 AM, it\u0027s bowing, chanting, meditation, and meetings with the Japanese zen master until the afternoon. Then he\u0027s in charge of constructing a toilet building for the monastery. Then more chanting in the evening. The daily schedule ends at 9:00 at night. I have to admit that I take a bit of perverse pleasure in the fact that even though Larry has rejected the secular life, he still has to navigate Home Depot, trying to figure out which grade of sand he needs to buy."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"30 mesh sand."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d use this."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"What would you use?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"The reason is that this stuff doesn\u0027t absorb water well."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Oh yeah?"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Driving around the suburbs filling the pickup with supplies is like old times. We gossip about mutual friends, talk about this and that. But that evening in the monastery when we get together on one of his breaks, things get a little more tense. We have the same conversation we\u0027ve had a dozen times. I still want him to explain what\u0027s wrong with his old life, the life we shared. Here\u0027s what he says."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Never been content. Restless. Never been there, never really being present, never being able to give myself fully to what it was. Holding back, ambivalence."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Did you see that about other people in San Francisco?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Who, you?"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Yeah, like me. So what\u0027s the answer to my-- I mean, do you think I\u0027m-- of course, I\u0027m suffering, I guess. But it also seems balanced out by this remarkably joyful existence. I guess I don\u0027t see it as a torture."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"That\u0027s why you\u0027re still in San Francisco and I\u0027m here, because I saw it as a torture. And it would be silly for me to try to convince you that it\u0027s torture. In a sense, I don\u0027t really want to do that. What all these masters of various traditions say is, of course, you\u0027re blind and you\u0027re living in a dream. You don\u0027t know, you don\u0027t realize how much suffering you\u0027re in."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"But they don\u0027t go out dragging people out of their houses and saying, well, actually you\u0027re suffering. Whatever. Through some circumstances, I found this path. I heard this message and addressed suffering that was real to me. And I moved in that direction. And I\u0027ve got to go."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"My visit is a burden for him. He\u0027s fitting it in during short breaks between chores and meditation. I\u0027m cutting into his five hours of sleep. I follow as he goes to hit this big ceremonial piece of wood which signals the end of the day for the monastery. After he\u0027s finished whacking the wood, Larry and I climb up the hill behind the monastery."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Hey, this is nice. Wow."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"We\u0027ve got a view and nobody sees it."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"What\u0027s that?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Right down there?"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"That\u0027s the sea of, you know, the LA sprawl. It\u0027s pretty huge."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"We sit down and talk."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"I want to know what you missed about San Francisco when you first came here and what you miss now about it or whether that\u0027s changed or whether those things have dissipated. What did you miss about San Francisco when you first came?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"I didn\u0027t miss anything. I mean, I missed my friends. That\u0027s all."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"When you say \"my friends, that\u0027s all,\" it seems like you\u0027re being sort of-- I guess, maybe, I took that as slightly dismissive of that. That\u0027s all. To leave your friends is a thing that I couldn\u0027t, right now, do."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Well, to make a possibly interesting situation truthful and boring, I did it in phases. I came here for three months. When I first came back here, I thought, God, I hate this place so much. I remember that I hated-- I hate this life. It\u0027s hard. It\u0027s cold. I\u0027m tired. I don\u0027t like to get up. It\u0027s mind numbing sitting in this box. My knees hurt. I\u0027m bored out of my skull. I\u0027m going to leave pretty soon. That\u0027s what I thought."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"But I said, well, it\u0027s kind of embarrassing to go running back, so I\u0027ll hang. For the wrong reason that works the right way, I stayed. And then in time, things unfolded, and they were so powerful. And they brought me crying to my knees enough times, and I felt like the years that I had been traveling around the world and seeing all these things had felt like I was traveling around the world in an iron lung. And here I was given the opportunity to get out of the iron lung and live in this simple place in the mountains."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"I still miss you, I have to say."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"I wish that my friends could experience what I\u0027ve experienced. And the world is a thousand times more interesting to me now than it was."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Have you discovered in all this why you are so tortured-- I mean, why you are more tortured than, say, me? Although you claim to know that I\u0027m tortured as well. But you have to believe me."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"When I see you, many times I see you as a portrait of torture. Your posture and your eyes looking away. And I can ask a few strategic, simple questions if I were to be sadistic about it and want to see this state of writhing. I can see you writhe in the way your eyes dart and the distraction of you."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Like what questions? What are we talking about?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"How\u0027s things going with your girlfriend? That could be a question I could have asked any time in the last five years and seen you do the dance of writhing. You\u0027re writhing now. I ask you this question and you\u0027re writhing now. You\u0027re not writhing because of the question entirely. You\u0027re writhing because it points to a deep sore spot in your soul."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"The problem with this discussion is that we disagree on all the premises. Larry doesn\u0027t see any value in his old life, the life I\u0027m still leading. He thinks I\u0027m barely experiencing the world. I have the same doubts about his life. He says he\u0027s never felt more alive, but I see his move to the simple life of the monastery as a withdrawl from the world. It would be easier to be more accepting of his choice if he could be more accepting of my world view."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"The fact is, Larry tried to simplify and clarify his life by coming here. But his life refused to be simplified. Shortly after he arrived at Mt. Baldy, he met a charming zen student named Katherine. Love affairs are discouraged at Mt. Baldy, so for over a year, Larry and Katherine had a mattress in the woods, and they would sneak away when they could."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"When Larry decided that he couldn\u0027t fulfill his monk duties, study zen, and have a relationship with Katherine, she left the monastery. Larry\u0027s now decided that in a few months, after the toilet building is finished, he\u0027ll follow her. I feel vindicated that he\u0027s leaving. I\u0027m not proud of that."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Is it a possibility that you\u0027d come back to San Francisco?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"I don\u0027t know."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Does it feel like a step back now?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Maybe it does. I don\u0027t know. Maybe it feels like a part of my life-- it\u0027s going to sound pompous to say I moved beyond it, but it\u0027s just suffused with things that I don\u0027t really want to pursue."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"So Larry and Katherine are going looking for another Zen community, a place that accepts couples."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Before I leave, I ask Larry to play some of his songs. Again, it\u0027s an experience where we disagree on every premise. I miss the times our friends would gather to hear him sing. I think it\u0027s a crime that he stopped writing his songs. Larry sees it differently. He calls them a catalog of his torture. But I make him sing a few for me. I want to get them on tape. Messages from the old Larry, a person I miss more than he does."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"[SINGING] Leave me alone. Leave me blue. Leave me, because I can\u0027t bear to leave you. Say goodnight. Hang up the phone. Believe me, when you leave me, you will leave me alone."}]},"4":{"actNumber":4,"actName":"Credits","contributorMap":{"null":{"episodes":{"111":"Adventures in the Simple Life"},"statements":["In other program notes, with this program, Paul Tough leaves his job as our senior editor to move back to Canada where he\u0027s going to run a big magazine called Saturday Night.

He watched TV, ate candy, rode a bike, all pretty much like any suburban kid, until, at the age of 17, he moved out in the woods and never came back."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"I had moved out into the forest. I was 17 years old, and I just decided that I would try an alternative style of living. And really, with that, I didn\u0027t think it all through in a major, complex way. I just decided I would like to try living outside. And so I moved out and started camping in a tepee, hunting and gathering food and making my own tools and clothes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And let me just be sure people understand. When you\u0027re living outside, you were there year round."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Yeah, totally moved out. In fact, I\u0027ve lived outside for 20 years now."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"From the time Eustace moved outside, he was interested in the past and all the things that people knew about how to live with nature, back when they had no choice about living with nature. For years, he lived in the woods, slept in a tepee, hunted his own food with bow and arrow, made his own clothes out of deerskin, his own utensils and tools."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then he started to evolve from a life as a hunter-gatherer to basic agriculture. He learned to plant and harvest, cultivated a patch of land, started raising animals, taught himself how to work with horses and mules. In other words, he personally went to through the major evolutionary stages that took the human species about 10,000 years during the Late Cenozoic. And around the same time he moved out into the forest, he had another idea, to ride a horse across America."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And I decided to do it when I was sitting around a campfire. And I heard about a couple that was living with their horses in the national forest. And it just sort of struck me. It was like a thunderbolt. It\u0027s like it came into my mind and I said-- it\u0027s like I didn\u0027t even know what was coming out of my mouth. I just said, I\u0027m going to ride a horse across America someday."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"And then he asked me if I wanted to go."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Eustace\u0027s younger brother, Judson."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"And my first reaction was, well, no, not really."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Why?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway","text":"It just seemed like a big undertaking, and I was happy in my little life. But then, I looked and I asked myself, well, what reason do you not have to go? Why shouldn\u0027t you go? Why not? And one of my biggest inspirations for going was to spend time with him."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah?"},{"text":"17 years after he first decided to ride across America, Eustace finally set out on the trail with his brother. The ride was partly an experiment in time travel. What happens when you try to live how people lived over a century ago? It was partly a lark, an adventure. Men on horses battling the elements, testing themselves, launched toward a goal they had no idea if they could reach."},{"text":"But I should tell you that for Eustace, the main idea behind this trip was not nearly so grand as all that. For Eustace, a big part of it was simply about horses. Eustace had been working with horses for a while when he sat out on the trail, but he knew there was just something about living with horses, working with horses, that he was going to learn if he rode so long, so steadily for months."},{"text":"He took Judson, who had worked with horses on a ranch in Wyoming, he was a wrangler, took people on trips into the wilderness, plus an acquaintance of theirs, Susan Klimkowski, who worked for a couple years in a stable, had a horse of her own. There are indoor people and there are outdoor people. Susan grew up down the street from Eustace and Judson, three kids who spent a lot of time out of doors."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"I grew up in a neighborhood where us kids, we all hung out and liked to run up and down the creek chasing crawdads and fish and snakes and turtles, but we lived in town."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you look around, do you feel like most people are indoors people or most people are outdoors people that you meet?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"Most people are indoors people, but I think they want to be outdoor. But they don\u0027t know how to get outside and enjoy it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"They set out on Christmas Day 1995 from a beach in South Carolina. They carried a cassette tape recorder with them to keep a kind of audio journal of their trip. And it\u0027s those tapes that make up a lot of our show today."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"So to make this history for the recorder, tell us who you are and what you\u0027re about."},{"speakerName":"David Elliott","text":"I\u0027m David Elliott. I\u0027m the priest here at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church. And I\u0027ll go out and bless the trip in a few minutes. I envy you. I think it\u0027ll be wonderful. Responsibilities tie me down. They tie everybody down."},{"speakerName":"David Elliott","text":"Let us pray. Dear God, our heavenly father, we give you thanks this day for the beauty of your creation. We give you thanks also for the human spirit. Guide these people on their trip all the way to California. Guide them safely, dear God. All this we ask in Christ\u0027s name. Amen."},{"speakerName":"David Elliott","text":"[OTHERS SAY AMEN]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio international, it\u0027s This. American. Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, Adventures in the Simple Life."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Long Riders. What you learn and what you find when you head out in the dead of winter, near the end of the 20th century, in a completely industrialized country, on a 2,500 mile horse trip."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Two, Zen Shmen. What happens when your best friend renounces everything the two of you share, everything about your lives, to go live a simpler life in the mountains in a monastery? Stay with us."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Long Riders. So when they set out, it was Eustace, Judson and Susan, four horses, one was a spare, camping gear, and a truck. And it\u0027s kind of a crazy scheme the way that they worked the whole thing. Every day, they would wake up, and then one of the would drive the truck 20 or 30 miles ahead to wherever it was they were going to camp the next night. And then that person would have to hitchhike back the same 20 or 30 miles, which could take hours."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then, after that, they would set out on their horses and they would ride all day. A couple months into the trip, they had this guy named Walker Young who joined the team to drive the truck ahead and find places to camp and handle stuff like that. The other crazy 20th century adaptation to their 19th century horse ride is it they did not ride through open country. They trotted along on the shoulders of highways, on the sides of roads. It seemed like the most efficient route."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You recorded yourselves as you rode across the country on a cassette machine, about 30 hours of tape, starting with that first day. Can I ask you what it was like setting out?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Oh, it was easy setting out. It was sort of like, OK, the day has come. We\u0027re going. I knew that we didn\u0027t know what we were doing. That was OK. I was real satisfied with that. I personally knew that there was a big chance that we wouldn\u0027t make it. My partners were a little bit younger and had done less traveling, a little bit more idealistic. And so they were Gung ho. Yeah, we\u0027re going to do this thing. We\u0027re going to make it."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"That sound in the background is the defroster. This is Eustace Conway on the 25th of December. Sitting beside me-- oh, you hear that little yelp? Let me hear that yelp again."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[YELPS]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"That was a big yelp. That\u0027s Judson Conway. He\u0027s a crazy. And then between us is the lovely lady. What\u0027s your name?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski On Tape","text":"Susan."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Susan what?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski On Tape","text":"Klimkowski."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"She\u0027s a simple lady."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In that first day, I have to say you all sound so young and happy."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We were. Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Trotting along, trotting along, trotting along. Beautiful pink clouds above our head, baby blue background, the pines are dark getting black in the bottom. It\u0027s hard to trot when you\u0027re halfway twisted around looking at the beauty of it. Man, what a day. Mmm."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"I feel fully alive, fully awake. It\u0027s sacred, this minute of living, of passion, with dream. I hear that Pileated Woodpecker in the background. I hear a car coming up behind me. Just a little bit further, we\u0027ll be off the bridge."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We knew almost nothing about this. We didn\u0027t know what we were doing. Even finding a route, like how were we going to go across."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you have a big atlas or something?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We had a few state road maps. A few state road maps is all we had to go by. And everybody kept saying, well, what\u0027s your route? How are you going to go? And I was like, I don\u0027t really know. We\u0027re heading west every day."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"It\u0027s 7:00 in the morning. This\u0027ll be our third day. It\u0027s about light enough to see out here, and the horses look well. Been going over for the last hour what we\u0027re going to do today. I think we\u0027ll drive the truck forward to highway 32."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Well, it\u0027s 9 o\u0027clock, and we\u0027re riding along. We stayed at Walter Hodges\u0027, and Clara Belle, their monkey, entertained us a little bit. They\u0027ve had their monkey for years. And he told us about how one time, she had gotten electrocuted by climbing up on some wires. And she was getting shocked, and it had been raining a little bit."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"So he backed his track up and got a broom-- a dry broom-- and knocked Clara Belle off. And she was stunned on the ground. And then later in the evening, he said, what do you think about the monkey? And they had referred to it as their daughter. I said, well, I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s kind of strange somebody keeps their daughter tied up in the backyard and gives her electrical shock treatments and then beats her with a broom. I guess you had to be there."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"We\u0027re getting our first rain right now, the first rain of the whole trip. It\u0027s drizzling. Not much of a rain, but enough to lower our spirits enough to worry."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"Hey."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Hey, no."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"Not my spirit, bro."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"You\u0027re over here whining."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"No, you were the one whining."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"\"I wish it would stop raining until we got to camp.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And describe how you were all outfitted. What did you all look like?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We were basically wearing a lot of the Western-style clothes, which wasn\u0027t for style but all these old cowboy clothes, they actually work. They do the things that you need. Silk scarves, cowboy hats."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"The chaps and the spurs and the whole bit."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"--had guns and knives and long hair and looked rough as hell and all kinds of stories, interesting reactions coming out of that. Well, here\u0027s a good description. Here\u0027s a story. We\u0027re trotting through this little town and going down Main Street, and I see someone through a plate glass window look at us. And they\u0027re sort of awed. The mouth drops open, it\u0027s like, my gosh, what\u0027s going on here?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I see the man just grab something from his desk and run out the front door. So I look back every once in a while, and this guy is sort of half-running behind us. Finally, we get to the edge of town. It\u0027s misting, a bit rainy. And he says, \"Hey, I didn\u0027t want to interrupt you. I thought you might be making a movie or something.\" It\u0027s like, \"No, we\u0027re not making a movie.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And he says, \"But you guys look so real. I mean, you really look real.\" And I was like, \"Well, I think that probably is because we really are real.\" And he said this over and another. It was like he was stuttering this chant, like, \"You guys look real. I mean, you really look real.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"And now-- I\u0027m glad the tape recorder\u0027s working-- now Judson\u0027s going to fire off a round to celebrate making it across a whole state in the Southeast Georgia. We just entered Alabama. Do it, brother!"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[FIRES GUN]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Whew! Oh, my god."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Let me ask you to talk about some of the people you met along the way."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Uh huh. Where would I begin? That\u0027s the most amazing part of the entire journey."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"People would really appreciate and take us in in ways that I never imagined would be possible. You know, these odd-looking rogues with long hair, knives and guns, and yet, the most conservative, Southern, clean-cut gentleman, farmers, would bring us right into their homes with their children, their wives, and just treat us like we were part of the family."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"The entire America was great. They were most gracious and accepted us. And we\u0027d go into one town and they\u0027d say, oh, watch out for this next town that you\u0027re going through because they\u0027re kind of questionable people. And we\u0027d get to that town and they\u0027d be just as nice as the last one. Everybody was great."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Long story. I don\u0027t know how much you want to tape. But let\u0027s just say one morning, I met these two guys. I was actually standing on the side of the road with a fan of money trying to get a ride. And they pull up to buy some beer, Sunday morning, actually."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"On their way to church."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Yeah. So this sporty little car pulls up with shiny mag wheels and comes to a stop right there at the quick stop across the road. And one of them goes in there to get something. I haven\u0027t met them at this time. So I\u0027m out there, and I kind of smile, hold my money up. And so apparently, J.L. was in the driver seat at this time. And he leans out of the car door and says, \"Hey, you got any money?\" And so I\u0027m embarrassed. I look around, I went, \"Yes.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"\"I say, you got any money?\" And I think I better go negotiate with this man before I alarm the whole neighborhood. So I told him I\u0027d give him $5 just to get me to the other side of the town. Actually, I\u0027d gotten a ride halfway already. So I was trying just to get on the other side of town. So we\u0027re sitting there negotiating back and forth and back and forth. And Tyrone comes walking out. these two guys are buddies, J.L. and Tyrone. Tyrone comes walking out with this beer. And he just looks at me, he says, \"You want a ride?\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And I said, \"Yeah.\" He says, \"Get in the truck.\" So apparently, it was Tyrone\u0027s truck. So they crank it up and they start going along. And Tyrone pulls out a beer from his six pack. And he grabs that and he opens it. You can see the mist coming out. And he just looks at it, and he smells it, and he\u0027s just about to take a swig. He\u0027s reverently getting ready to drink his beer."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And he\u0027s just about to turn it back and drink, and he looks to me. All of a sudden, he remembers his manners. He\u0027s like, \"You like beer?\" I say, \"Uh huh.\" \"You want a beer?\" Being polite, I say, \"Well, sure, OK.\" So he gives me a beer. Then he cracks another one for himself. He says, \"I like beer. I love beer. I\u0027ll drink beer every day.\" So then he takes this big morning drink. It\u0027s like, whoa, this guy is into his beer."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I\u0027m sitting there talking to J.L., hanging through the truck window. And he\u0027s telling me about his life. So he\u0027ll tell me something, and then I\u0027ll tell him something. I\u0027m telling him about the Long Riders journey. And I\u0027m telling him about the horses. Yeah, we got horses waiting over there. He\u0027s listening. At this time, I had no idea. But he thought I was full of [BLEEP]. He thought I was tripping on acid and had no idea that anything I was saying made any sense."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So we\u0027re having this conversation. And I think he\u0027s believing everything, so I\u0027m telling him about my life, my story."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You\u0027re telling him your life, so you\u0027re telling him, \"I live in the woods. I\u0027ve lived there since I was a teenager. I trap my own animals.\" And he\u0027s just thinking, yeah right."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"You got it. You got the picture. So we get to the gas station. I fill them up with gas. Then we drive on. And so we come around the bend. He starts wondering if I even know where I want to go, like, if I\u0027m just crazy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Making the whole thing up. Right."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So we round the bend, and there is my partners with the horses. And J.L. is like, \"[BLEEP], man, they got horses! They got horses!\" He is just absolutely amazed. He throws the car into park and jumps out, leaves the door wide open, and just runs over to the horses and reaches out to touch them, as if, can they be real?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"All of a sudden, everything shifts. Instead of being a freak, all of a sudden, he\u0027s got respect for me, and the reality comes in. And he wants to help out. Instead of trying to take my money-- here\u0027s how I met this guy. \"You got any money?\" He\u0027s trying hard as he can to take me for any kind of dollar bill. And all of a sudden, heart comes in. Feeling. Something totally shifts. And he cares about us. And so he comes out and meets us on the road several times, brings a friend. They drive the truck ahead a couple of days. And just such a shift from our introduction."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When they\u0027d ride into town, they\u0027d try to find somebody with a fenced-in field or yard, and they would ask them if they could camp there. And over and over, people not only said yes, they invited them in for hot meals and hot showers, helped them out any way they could. There was this one family in Louisiana, the Marbles, who, after putting up Eustace and Judson and Susan for days, really, helping them find a new horse, decided to deliver them a hot turkey meal with stuffing and cranberry dressing and all the fixings out on the road."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"We were riding down the road several hundred miles from where they live. And all of a sudden, they drive by hooting and hollering out the window. My gosh, is that the Marbles? And they pulled over ahead of us and by the time we got to them, they had a big old Thanksgiving dinner is what I called it, even though it was January or February."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And they had driven hundreds of miles?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Yeah, and they had no idea exactly where we were. They was just in a hope that they could find us. All the cooking, all the driving, all the planning to have that Sunday afternoon to come try to find us. And they did."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Judson, why do you think people were responding the way they were to the three of you traveling?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Because we were doing something that everybody dreams about but nobody takes the risk to do-- or the time, the energy, the money, the challenge to do."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"I guess I have my own way of thinking about it, is I wanted to tell people you can do whatever you want. Celebrate life. Don\u0027t just work at a grind forever. Just stop. Just say, \"I want to do this. That\u0027s what I did. I said I want to ride a horse across the country. I had a thousand people tell me I couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t listen to one of them. I said, I\u0027m going to do this. And I got on a horse and started out. I didn\u0027t know how to do this journey. I didn\u0027t know much about riding horses."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It sounds like the three of you are just out there just like putting your hearts out there. You know what I mean? Just doing this thing. And so that just calls this thing forward from other people where they want to do it too."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"It does. People would even just ride up and roll down their window and stick out a $10 bill."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"Several times, we would turn people down. People were like, \"Let me help you. You can stay at our house.\" And we\u0027re like, \"Well, we\u0027ve already got plans. Somebody already pulled over and invited us to stay their house.\" And several times, we split up, and one of us would spend the night one place and somebody else would spend the night somewhere else."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Part of this reaction had to do with the horses, Eustace and Judson say. They had both hitchhiked across America, and they say that people are not nearly so friendly. But with the horses, they would ride into town, looking like cowboys, charming and dusty, like figures not just out of a the movie but out of some dream that we all have of America."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When these epic figures trot up the interstate into your town, how could you not stare? Who would not want to be near something so larger than life. People didn\u0027t just give them money. People wanted to talk to them, tell them their stories, which Eustace recorded on tape."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Allison, tell our diary what\u0027s going on. What do you do for a living? Where are we? And anything you want to say?"},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"We\u0027re at a rock shop out in the middle of nowhere. In fact, we\u0027re three miles from the middle of nowhere. Mile marker 33 is the middle. We just kind of poke along out here. And this used to be owned by Sam and Vera Jones."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Sam was otherwise known as Rattlesnake Jones. He believed in protecting rattlesnakes. He had a rattlesnake pit out here with over 200 rattlesnakes in it at all times. Him and Vera also had two pet bobcats. And a lot of neat history out here."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Sam killed himself on the front doorstep over there of the trailer because he was dying of cancer and all sorts of health problems. He was living on a hospital bed on an oxygen tank. And he told his wife that he was going shoot himself that morning. And she said as long as he didn\u0027t do it inside the house. She didn\u0027t want to clean up the mess. And she knew he was serious. And she was out in the rock shop and heard the gunshot and waited about an hour before she called the ambulance because he didn\u0027t want to be resuscitated. He wanted to be dead."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"My goodness."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Yeah, it\u0027s real interesting out here."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"My dad was a bird hunter. And we had three or four milk cows. My sister and brothers, they\u0027d milk the cows. I\u0027d feed the horse. My dad would feed the mules. He would pass through the rooms, say, get up, boys."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Get up, boys."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"And look, he wasn\u0027t going to say \"get up boys\" but one time. And the next time, he\u0027d say, I thought you boys were supposed to be up. The next time, he had that broom handle. And ain\u0027t no such a thing as child abuse."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"The first time is when he wanted it to be done."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"And you better get out the bed, because let I\u0027m going to tell you something. My daddy didn\u0027t play. 270 pounds of pure man."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"I heard that."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"6:00 in the morning here. Just got up. Stars are bright. I\u0027m going to go check on the horses here and give them their feed as early as possible so that they\u0027ll have time to digest it before we head out. Hello there, boys. Hello, boys. Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"It\u0027s hard to imagine, now that I really think about it, how a camera crew or even a news team of writers could capture what I think is best about this trip-- the movement, the familiarity with the known, the process of the day, the challenge, the freshness, the warmth of the simplicity, the support of the people like the ones in that car that waved as they just went by, the pattern of day-by-day moving as a herd across North America. There\u0027s no way that they could capture what I really want to share."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Beautiful, quiet night. No light except the stars. The Big Dipper shining bright and pointing out to the North Star. We made it 30 miles, so I feel really good. Glad to be with my good partners, good horses. Good."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Coming up, The Dark Side of the Horse, in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s This American. Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Adventures in the Simple Life."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We\u0027re in the middle of Act One, the story of three people traveling across country with some horses and a tape recorder-- prerequisite for getting on our show. I cannot state strongly enough how much of the 30 hours of tape they recorded is simply the three of them talking about the horses. Hours of detail about the horses\u0027 shoes and the color of their urine, and how the horses are doing. And I have to say, for city people sitting in an office in Chicago, listening to all this, it was hard to understand what it was all about. But, of course, what it was all about was the difficulty of being on the road, which is where our story resumes."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And then we started meeting the miles and meeting the challenges and being up at 2:00 in the morning fixing equipment and getting up before daylight. Some nights, we\u0027d sleep four hours, and we didn\u0027t go to bed refreshed. We went to bed worn out. We\u0027d get up four hours later and start feeding and brushing horses."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"So it\u0027s pouring rain, and we\u0027re stopped by a little, metal building on the side of the road. And we pulled over and one of Mac\u0027s shoes, I noticed his back, left shoe was falling off. What in the hell are we going to do? Oh, jeez."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"8:30 in the morning on March-- what is today, everybody?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"15th."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"15th?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski On Tape","text":"[INAUDIBLE]."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"And I feel puny. My stomach is just feeling like a burnt pancake that got stepped on by an elephant and then eaten by a roadrunner and then [BLEEP] on top of a green stinkbug that\u0027s eating its way through it. And that\u0027s how my stomach feels. I might just vomit in this microphone."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Turning right on a dirt road. And Judson\u0027s reaching for his six shooter. What\u0027s that boy doing? Oh my gosh, we\u0027re crossing into Arkansas. Oh, my gosh."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[YELPS AND FIRES GUN]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Oh, my goodness! We made it to Arkansas! [YELPS]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Are we really here, or is it just a dream? I think we\u0027re about to touch Texas. And there\u0027s a big old rock there that says \"Texas.\" Oh my gosh, it\u0027s real. We\u0027re really doing it."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"[GUN FIRES]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Yes! [YELPS] Albert, settle down, boy. It\u0027s just a .357."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Let me ask you to explain as you\u0027re going into Arizona."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"Oh, my. Very interesting situation. Almost embarrassing. But the fact is, we had just bought a horse. And this one hadn\u0027t been handled in a very long time and had a reputation, in the few times it had been handled, of being more or less wild. And so I\u0027m riding along, and we get to the Arizona line. Every time we get to a line, one of us-- usually Judson, my brother-- shoots off a gun, just as a celebration, reckoning that we made it to another state line."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So we go through the gate, and I shut the gate, and we\u0027re there. It\u0027s like, OK, let\u0027s celebrate. And intuitively, I knew not to get up on this horse. But my brother, for some reason, I don\u0027t know why, he said, get up on your horse. And for some reason, I followed his instructions and got up on the horse."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"There it is, boy. It\u0027s the state line. We\u0027re getting ready for a big bang. My gosh, we\u0027re getting into Arizona. Woo! We are walking in the soul of another state, and proud of it."},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway On Tape","text":"[SHOOTS GUN] [YELPS]"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"I got bucked off of this damn black horse. He\u0027s not used to a gunshot. Guess I\u0027m trying to stay awake now. Seems like maybe my head is addled. Maybe I have a concussion or something."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"And I cracked my head. Blood everywhere. The power of it goes from my head to my shoulder, twisted my neck, hit my back, tearing my back open, ripping my shirt. And I\u0027m just sitting there slumped, hurting. And it was not what I wanted to happen."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How much of a break did you take before you started writing again? Did you take the--"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"I didn\u0027t take a minute off. I climbed back up, blood was still running down. The blood knitted my hair back together. That\u0027s what held my scalp together. I just let the dried blood hold it back together."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you think about seeing a doctor?"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"There weren\u0027t any doctors anywhere nearby. Oh, my. My brother and Susan are kind of like normal people. But my lifestyle has been forever very extraordinarily different than common, normal America. Just about a month ago, I rode a horse into a tree. I was chasing another horse. And it got dark, and I did not want to give up on catching this horse. It was the first time I\u0027d ever let this horse go."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I ran right into a tree and knocked my head back. When I came forward, all of a sudden I heard all this splashing. Blood was flying all around my saddle splashing down. And I wondered, my gosh, what have I done? And I stuck my tongue through my lip. It was right through the front of my face. I was like, ooh, that does not feel right."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"So I went to a mirror. See, I don\u0027t have electricity, so I lit some candles and looked in the mirror, and I had three huge holes in my face that were gaping open, profusely bleeding. So I could\u0027ve gone to a doctor. I live way out in the country. But I just got out a needle and thread and sewed my face back together. It was about 14 stitches. Pulled it back together and I was good to go. Had to heal up and the swelling had to go down and all that, but it\u0027s healed up real good."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"But see, that\u0027s the story of my life. Me, what I\u0027m trying to teach people and what I believe in is that you can do things yourself. You can take care of yourself. You can be responsible, and should be responsible, for yourself. I was born in normal suburbia. In fact, I guess that\u0027s one of the important things about me being able to do some of these things of living like people did a long time ago, is I went from normal suburbia. I know the American people. I can speak your language. But I live in a very different way that\u0027s come through decades of experience and voluntarily living by a whole other set of values and reality."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Even when you embark on an adventure in the simple life, it doesn\u0027t get all that simple. Life resists simplicity. On this horse trip across America, the logistics of getting from place to place were as complicated as you might imagine, with that truck to move around and 20th century traffic always threatening to run them over. And then having to provision horses and get new horses and find a place to stay every night. It took money and telephones and all the skill with people that anybody would be able to muster."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then there\u0027s the mundane fact that like any people on a long trip together, Eustace and Judson and Susan got on each other\u0027s nerves sometimes. When it happened, one of them would ride ahead a ways for a while, get a break from the others. And when they finally made it to California, to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, what\u0027s striking is how bittersweet it was."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"That was a pretty intense day. We started riding. And that part of California is very hilly. And you\u0027d ride up a hill and you think, we\u0027re going to look out and see the ocean. And we didn\u0027t. We rode and rode and rode before we saw the ocean. And you\u0027re just hoping and waiting for this end. It\u0027s kind of climactic, waiting for it to come up, and it never would. You\u0027d just see more houses and more streets. It was like, \"ugh.\""},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"Almost at the beach. I can smell it and feel it and see it in the traffic and the worry in the people faces. And it\u0027s exciting because we\u0027re almost there."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Hey, cowboys!"},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway On Tape","text":"We are cowboys. Hey, cowboys! That\u0027s what they call us here."},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"And finally, we saw it. And it was like, wow. It was a weird feeling. It was like, now what do we do?"},{"speakerName":"Judson Conway In Studio","text":"I thought it was going to be more crazy energy. It was more self-reflective energy. It was more just sitting on your horse and staring at the ocean and going, wow. It was more just, we did it. And in the hot days of Arizona, somehow, I was just going, man, if I get to that ocean, I\u0027m going to get off and just go running, dive in the water and swim out as far as I can. And all that crazy excitement didn\u0027t happen. It was more just a silent stare."},{"speakerName":"Eustace Conway In Studio","text":"We just stood there. Just stood there looking at it, unbelieving that we had gotten there. And looking around and, is this really sand under our feet? Are those really waves there? It was like if you could just scream \"wow\" and let it echo for a couple of hours. Wow, wow, wow."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What do you carry back into your everyday life from a journey like this? Eustace is back living in the woods, having learned what he said he wanted to learn about horses on the trip. Judson\u0027s a fly fishing guide in North Carolina, starting his own business doing that. And Susan\u0027s the one who set to make the biggest transition, back to modern life, indoor life. She moved to Oklahoma to be closer to her grandfather, who\u0027s been ill."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What\u0027s your job now? What are you doing?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"I\u0027m an order selector at a local warehouse here. It\u0027s Associated Wholesale Grocers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And so what\u0027s that\u0027s like to go to a job like that after having been on the road for months?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"It\u0027s pretty crazy. We work hard every day. It\u0027s a pretty labor-intensive job. And it\u0027s interesting to look at the perspectives of my fellow employees and how this is their life, and this is what they do. And I kind of see past it, and I see what I\u0027ve done and that there\u0027s so much more out there."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you find you talk about it a lot now, months later?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"A little bit. Not a whole lot. I\u0027m living in Oklahoma and don\u0027t know a whole lot of people. And if I tell them that I rode my horse across country, I don\u0027t think they\u0027d believe me. But I reflect back on it quite a bit."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Have you told people at work?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"A few."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And so what do they say?"},{"speakerName":"Susan Klimkowski In Studio","text":"They don\u0027t believe me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Two, Zen Shmen. Here\u0027s something that was written back when people rode horses because they mostly had no choice, the middle of the 19th century, a quarter century before the invention of the light bulb. Most people lived on the farm or in small towns. And yet, America was already so big and changing so fast and so unprecedented and alarming, that already, people worried that modernity and everything all that came with it was making it hard to think properly, to feel properly, to really live. Here\u0027s the reading."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life. I wanted to live deep, to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms. And if it proved to be mean, wanted to get to the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world. Or, if it were sublime, to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is Henry Thoreau from his book Walden, published in 1854. It is a clean line of heritage from this to the voluntary simplicity movement and so many other movements today, which seek to shed all the stuff that clutters our lives, fills our heads."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Here\u0027s Thoreau again. \"The nation is cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense. It lives too fast. Men think that it\u0027s essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride 30 miles an hour. But whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Here\u0027s my favorite passage from Thoreau. It\u0027s especially appropriate for this week-- for any week, really, in which people are obsessed with the news. What I love about it is this simultaneously provocative and completely reasonable and, at the same time from my perspective, almost totally nuts."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He writes, \"I am sure that I have never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter, we never need read of another. One is enough. If you\u0027re acquainted with the principle, what do you care for myriad instances and applications?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"\"To a philosopher, all \u0027news,\u0027 as it\u0027s called, is gossip. And they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet, not if you were greedy after this gossip. News which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or 12 years beforehand with sufficient accuracy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"\"As for Spain, for instance. If you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions-- they may have changed names a little since I saw the papers-- it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or ruin of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers. And as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, we move on. One of the difficulties with simplifying your life is that people are complicated. So simplifying your life often means cutting yourself off from people, which can be complicated in and of itself. Ethan Watters has this story."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"A couple of years ago, my best friend, Larry left his life in San Francisco to study Zen at a monastery in the mountains near Los Angeles. What made his decision so unsettling was that Larry used to be me. We lived in the same flat. We had the same friends. We were both writers. We wrote for the same magazines. For me, this life was a blessing. Larry said it was a torturous cycle of unfulfillable desire rotting him from the inside."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Larry has now been ordained as a monk. He\u0027s even taken a new zen name, Takado. It\u0027s been two years, but I still don\u0027t fully understand how he could have rejected our life in San Francisco. Larry picks me up at the airport while on an errand run for the Zen Center."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Here\u0027s what we have to do. We have to go Home Depot and buy a lot of things that I\u0027m not so sure about. So we\u0027ll have to figure a lot of things out in Home Depot. And then we have to find this dry cleaners place that I think is on Central or Monte Vista."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"For what?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"To bring a bowing mat that somebody spilled wax on. And then we have to go to--"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"In his new life, Larry wakes up at 2:50 in the morning to make tea for the rest of the monks and students. From 3:00 AM, it\u0027s bowing, chanting, meditation, and meetings with the Japanese zen master until the afternoon. Then he\u0027s in charge of constructing a toilet building for the monastery. Then more chanting in the evening. The daily schedule ends at 9:00 at night. I have to admit that I take a bit of perverse pleasure in the fact that even though Larry has rejected the secular life, he still has to navigate Home Depot, trying to figure out which grade of sand he needs to buy."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"30 mesh sand."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d use this."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"What would you use?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"The reason is that this stuff doesn\u0027t absorb water well."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Oh yeah?"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Driving around the suburbs filling the pickup with supplies is like old times. We gossip about mutual friends, talk about this and that. But that evening in the monastery when we get together on one of his breaks, things get a little more tense. We have the same conversation we\u0027ve had a dozen times. I still want him to explain what\u0027s wrong with his old life, the life we shared. Here\u0027s what he says."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Never been content. Restless. Never been there, never really being present, never being able to give myself fully to what it was. Holding back, ambivalence."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Did you see that about other people in San Francisco?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Who, you?"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Yeah, like me. So what\u0027s the answer to my-- I mean, do you think I\u0027m-- of course, I\u0027m suffering, I guess. But it also seems balanced out by this remarkably joyful existence. I guess I don\u0027t see it as a torture."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"That\u0027s why you\u0027re still in San Francisco and I\u0027m here, because I saw it as a torture. And it would be silly for me to try to convince you that it\u0027s torture. In a sense, I don\u0027t really want to do that. What all these masters of various traditions say is, of course, you\u0027re blind and you\u0027re living in a dream. You don\u0027t know, you don\u0027t realize how much suffering you\u0027re in."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"But they don\u0027t go out dragging people out of their houses and saying, well, actually you\u0027re suffering. Whatever. Through some circumstances, I found this path. I heard this message and addressed suffering that was real to me. And I moved in that direction. And I\u0027ve got to go."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"My visit is a burden for him. He\u0027s fitting it in during short breaks between chores and meditation. I\u0027m cutting into his five hours of sleep. I follow as he goes to hit this big ceremonial piece of wood which signals the end of the day for the monastery. After he\u0027s finished whacking the wood, Larry and I climb up the hill behind the monastery."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Hey, this is nice. Wow."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"We\u0027ve got a view and nobody sees it."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"What\u0027s that?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Right down there?"},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"That\u0027s the sea of, you know, the LA sprawl. It\u0027s pretty huge."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"We sit down and talk."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"I want to know what you missed about San Francisco when you first came here and what you miss now about it or whether that\u0027s changed or whether those things have dissipated. What did you miss about San Francisco when you first came?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"I didn\u0027t miss anything. I mean, I missed my friends. That\u0027s all."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"When you say \"my friends, that\u0027s all,\" it seems like you\u0027re being sort of-- I guess, maybe, I took that as slightly dismissive of that. That\u0027s all. To leave your friends is a thing that I couldn\u0027t, right now, do."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Well, to make a possibly interesting situation truthful and boring, I did it in phases. I came here for three months. When I first came back here, I thought, God, I hate this place so much. I remember that I hated-- I hate this life. It\u0027s hard. It\u0027s cold. I\u0027m tired. I don\u0027t like to get up. It\u0027s mind numbing sitting in this box. My knees hurt. I\u0027m bored out of my skull. I\u0027m going to leave pretty soon. That\u0027s what I thought."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"But I said, well, it\u0027s kind of embarrassing to go running back, so I\u0027ll hang. For the wrong reason that works the right way, I stayed. And then in time, things unfolded, and they were so powerful. And they brought me crying to my knees enough times, and I felt like the years that I had been traveling around the world and seeing all these things had felt like I was traveling around the world in an iron lung. And here I was given the opportunity to get out of the iron lung and live in this simple place in the mountains."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"I still miss you, I have to say."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"I wish that my friends could experience what I\u0027ve experienced. And the world is a thousand times more interesting to me now than it was."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Have you discovered in all this why you are so tortured-- I mean, why you are more tortured than, say, me? Although you claim to know that I\u0027m tortured as well. But you have to believe me."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"When I see you, many times I see you as a portrait of torture. Your posture and your eyes looking away. And I can ask a few strategic, simple questions if I were to be sadistic about it and want to see this state of writhing. I can see you writhe in the way your eyes dart and the distraction of you."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Like what questions? What are we talking about?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"How\u0027s things going with your girlfriend? That could be a question I could have asked any time in the last five years and seen you do the dance of writhing. You\u0027re writhing now. I ask you this question and you\u0027re writhing now. You\u0027re not writhing because of the question entirely. You\u0027re writhing because it points to a deep sore spot in your soul."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"The problem with this discussion is that we disagree on all the premises. Larry doesn\u0027t see any value in his old life, the life I\u0027m still leading. He thinks I\u0027m barely experiencing the world. I have the same doubts about his life. He says he\u0027s never felt more alive, but I see his move to the simple life of the monastery as a withdrawl from the world. It would be easier to be more accepting of his choice if he could be more accepting of my world view."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"The fact is, Larry tried to simplify and clarify his life by coming here. But his life refused to be simplified. Shortly after he arrived at Mt. Baldy, he met a charming zen student named Katherine. Love affairs are discouraged at Mt. Baldy, so for over a year, Larry and Katherine had a mattress in the woods, and they would sneak away when they could."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"When Larry decided that he couldn\u0027t fulfill his monk duties, study zen, and have a relationship with Katherine, she left the monastery. Larry\u0027s now decided that in a few months, after the toilet building is finished, he\u0027ll follow her. I feel vindicated that he\u0027s leaving. I\u0027m not proud of that."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Is it a possibility that you\u0027d come back to San Francisco?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"I don\u0027t know."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Does it feel like a step back now?"},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"Maybe it does. I don\u0027t know. Maybe it feels like a part of my life-- it\u0027s going to sound pompous to say I moved beyond it, but it\u0027s just suffused with things that I don\u0027t really want to pursue."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"So Larry and Katherine are going looking for another Zen community, a place that accepts couples."},{"speakerName":"Ethan Watters","text":"Before I leave, I ask Larry to play some of his songs. Again, it\u0027s an experience where we disagree on every premise. I miss the times our friends would gather to hear him sing. I think it\u0027s a crime that he stopped writing his songs. Larry sees it differently. He calls them a catalog of his torture. But I make him sing a few for me. I want to get them on tape. Messages from the old Larry, a person I miss more than he does."},{"speakerName":"Larry","text":"[SINGING] Leave me alone. Leave me blue. Leave me, because I can\u0027t bear to leave you. Say goodnight. Hang up the phone. Believe me, when you leave me, you will leave me alone."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, our program was produced today by Alix Spiegel and myself with Nancy Updike and Julie Snyder, senior editor Paul Tough, contributing editors Jack Hitt, Margy Rochlin, and consigliere Sarah Vowell.
