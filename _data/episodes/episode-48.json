After World War II, the Nuremberg trials documented German war crime atrocities and the Holocaust. But Germans didn\u0027t accept it. Historians have noted that, as far as the Germans were concerned, Nuremberg wasn\u0027t real justice. It was just a bunch of outsiders coming in after the war, imposing victor\u0027s justice."

And even that wasn\u0027t enough. As one writer put it, it took an accumulation of a million school visits to concentration camps, 1,000 books, the Hollywood television series, Holocaust, a vast molecular reckoning between generations that\u0027s still going on."

Well, ever since the end of World War II, there\u0027s been this idealistic notion kicking around that when nations do horrible things, the best way to deal with it, to put those things to rest, would be to have a court somewhere, a court for war crimes, for crimes against humanity. And now, for the first time since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of World War II, a court like this is actually in session. This is the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."

        "And I got them around a table, and I asked them, at one point, don\u0027t you think it would be possible for you all to get together and produce a history of the war that is a simple narrative of how this catastrophe happened to your three societies? There was a kind of deafening silence after I made this liberal, well-meaning proposal.",
        "And people then just said, a common history is impossible. We couldn\u0027t do it. We couldn\u0027t even agree what events should be included. We couldn\u0027t even agree on when the war began. I mean, some people think the war began in June 1991 when the JNA tanks marched into Slovenia. Other people think the war began in \u002785 and \u002786 when Serbian nationalism began to take off.",
        "Even simple factual questions become, in other words, questions of attribution of responsibility and questions of guilt. I mean, it\u0027ll take generations, and I\u0027m not sure that outsiders can do it. It\u0027s like a family trauma. And as a family, they will have to talk it out. But it will take 30, 40, 50 years.",
        "Well, I don\u0027t want to be cynical about that, because I think juridical truth is terribly important. And here, I think, outsiders can play a limited role, because an outsider can say, here are the forensic facts about certain war crimes, and we can establish them. An international tribunal can establish what war crimes happened, where, by whom, and to whom.",
        "There\u0027s no guarantee that that truth will then reach out through the society at large, but at least it constitutes one kind of place, somewhere, where honest men can find what actually happened.",
        "Absolutely a first step. And it would be naive to think that when the tribunal winds up its work in so many years\u0027 time, and all the volumes of evidence are published, that this is of itself going to make much difference. I mean, the really scary thing is the sense in which in a lot of Serbian society and Croatian society, the conclusions and even the evidence of the Hague are discounted before it\u0027s even heard, as being, you know, this kind of alien enemy, nobody understands this but ourselves, that kind of line. You know, no one understands the Serbs but the Serbs, no one understands the Croats but the Croats, no one understands the Muslims but the Muslims, and therefore, anything that an international tribunal says to them has to be wrong.",
        "Yes. The tragedy in the Balkans is that, at the moment, there\u0027s no place for the truth to go, because the regimes that are in power, all of them-- and I include the Muslim side-- are not regimes which really allow, and welcome, and let the truth circulate freely. And until they are, the Hague tribunal will be crying in the wilderness."

That was a total accident, but I think that if they would have apologized for hitting him, he would have forgiven them, because I think that forgiveness was a big part of his personality. I think he really believed in the power of forgiveness, and everyone can be forgiven if they\u0027re sorry. I think that\u0027s something that he really believed in."

        "And McDonald isn\u0027t the only American working at the tribunal.",
        "Prosecutor Alan Tieger is on loan to the tribunal from the Department of Justice. About two dozen American lawyers, investigators, and other experts have been seconded-- or loaned out-- to the tribunal, their salaries paid by the US government. Americans make up the largest legal community at the tribunal. The contingent is so large, some complain that through sheer numbers, they\u0027re turning what\u0027s supposed to be a brand-new legal system into something that looks a lot like US Constitutional law.",
        "Most of the Americans are here out of a sense of moral conviction. Alan Tieger, like Judge McDonald, was a civil rights lawyer. He was one of the prosecutors at the federal Rodney King beating trial. His parents were Holocaust survivors. The prosecution\u0027s chief investigator, Terree Bowers, says he came to the Hague to do work of significance to humankind. But from the start, his new job presented challenges he never faced in his old position as head of the US Attorney\u0027s Office in Los Angeles.",
        "There were all sorts of challenges. And one thing in particular that Americans, and other non-Yugoslavs at the tribunal found so very difficult to understand-- the now familiar stories of neighbor turning against neighbor, almost overnight. Judge McDonald asked witness after witness about this, over and over again.",
        "She never found an answer that satisfied her. And as the trial wore on, she and other judges found themselves searching for something in their own experiences to explain it. And that raises this question, what does it mean when people with one sort of history are trying and judging people with a very different sort?",
        "It was back in May of 1993 that the United Nations Security Council set up the tribunal at the urging of the US and Western Europe. At the time, NATO was resisting pleas from the Bosnians to come to their aid in the war, and cynics suggested that the West set up the tribunal simply because it was easier to commit lawyers than troops.",
        "Again, Judge McDonald.",
        "But to see just how difficult it is to make a contribution, consider the case of Witness L. The tribunal allows witnesses who fear for their lives to testify behind closed doors, their identities secret. Witness L explained to the tribunal that he was a guard at one of the Serb-run prison camps, where he witnessed the tribunal\u0027s first defendant, a Bosnian Serb karate teacher named Dusan Tadic, commit more crimes.",
        "The prosecution had other witnesses who told of Tadic delivering brutal beatings, but L was the only credible witness who saw Tadic rape and kill people. L testified about one incident where 10 elderly men were taken into the infamous white house, the scene of most tortures at the Omarska prison camp.",
        "According to L, Tadic pointed to him and said, \"Come here and perform the killing of these 10 prisoners.\" L answered, \"Why me? Why do I have to do it?\" Tadic apparently grew impatient. L said Tadic approached the prisoners and shot two of them in the head, point blank. It was dramatic, damning testimony, the strongest brought forward by the prosecution.",
        "Unfortunately, it wasn\u0027t true. Two months after L\u0027s initial court appearance, prosecutors had to stand before the court and admit that L had lied on the stand. He had never been a camp guard. He\u0027d never witnessed the alleged atrocities. He\u0027d never even seen Dusan Tadic in person until he walked into the courtroom. Prosecution investigator Robert Reid told the court L was a Bosnian Serb soldier. He said he\u0027d been caught by the Bosnian Muslim army, and then was coerced into testifying.",
        "In the weeks since then, the prosecution says it\u0027s uncovered new evidence that shows the Bosnian Serb government didn\u0027t coach Witness L. At this point, it\u0027s unclear what to believe of his testimony, and the whole episode raises disturbing questions for the Americans and Western Europeans who first pushed for the establishment of the international criminal tribunal.",
        "Gabrielle Kirk McDonald is arguably the most powerful African-American woman in the world, but you\u0027ve probably never heard of her. McDonald is the presiding judge for the first international war crimes trial in half a century. As she sits in her judicial robes week after week inside the courtroom, it becomes clear that Judge McDonald is like most Americans when it comes to things foreign. We can\u0027t read the maps.",
        "If these trials were designed to get at the truth, they were being tainted by a witness who lied. If they were trying to bring justice to the victims, it was those victims-- the Muslims, in this case-- who were fabricating evidence, trying to swing the verdict their way.",
        "Thus far, the tribunal has only handed down one sentence. It\u0027s a case where no one disputes the basic facts of the crime. This was the case of Drazen Erdemovic. It\u0027s a story of a man who risked his life and his freedom to tell the world the truth about what he\u0027d done.",
        "Erdemovic is 25, a baby-faced kid with acne scars. He\u0027s Croatian. His wife is a Serb. They have a young son. Erdemovic was trained as a tool and dye maker. But by the time he had learned his trade, the war had broken out, so he became a career soldier, and served with all three armies during the war. But he says he chose combat units that conducted reconnaissance missions and manned border checkpoints, jobs where he didn\u0027t have to kill anyone.",
        "Until July of 1995, that\u0027s when his special battalion of the Bosnian Serb army, the 10th sabotage unit, was ordered to a farm field near Pilica. It was shortly after the fall of Srebrenica. The UN had set up a safe area there, where 25,000 Bosnian Muslims had fled for protection. But when the Bosnian Serb army attacked, the tiny UN force didn\u0027t offer much resistance. In fact, UN peacekeepers helped load Muslim men onto buses that took them away, never to be seen again.",
        "Erdemovic and his unit had been given instructions on how to kill large numbers of people in a short period of time. And then the buses started arriving. The first group of 10 wore blindfolds, their hands tied behind their backs. Erdemovic and his comrades were then ordered to shoot the prisoners in the back.",
        "But Erdemovic emptied his rifle again and again, killing as many as 100 of the 1,200 killed that day.",
        "Erdemovic\u0027s unit was then ordered to a nearby town where, perhaps, 500 other Bosnian Muslims were being held inside a meeting hall. He and his unit were ordered to kill them as well. Erdemovic says, this time, he did refuse, saying, wasn\u0027t there enough blood? Weren\u0027t there enough dead people? Erdemovic says he didn\u0027t care what happened to himself anymore. He told American prosecutor Mark Harmon, \"I didn\u0027t want to become a robot for extermination.\"",
        "Erdemovic\u0027s refusal to kill again did not go unnoticed by his comrades. A few days later, in a bar fight, one of them shot him four times. Erdemovic says it was because they knew he couldn\u0027t keep his mouth shut. And he couldn\u0027t. Erdemovic says after the massacre, he couldn\u0027t sleep. He stayed away from home and drank. After he had partially recovered from the gunshot wounds, he says he finally decided to tell his story to the war crimes tribunal. But there was no tribunal representative anywhere nearby.",
        "So he went to the American embassy in Belgrade. They gave him a list of news agencies. He called the first one on the list and told his story to a stringer for ABC News. Unfortunately, the phones were tapped, and the reporter\u0027s tapes were confiscated at the airport. Erdemovic was quickly arrested, but not before he had talked to another reporter with the Paris daily paper, Le Figaro. His story of the Pilica massacre was translated and retold all over the world. Erdemovic eventually made his way to the tribunal, where he told his story again.",
        "Judges deciding his case had a difficult time understanding how Erdemovic got himself into such a no-win situation. Why didn\u0027t he just flee the country? Erdemovic explained, you couldn\u0027t get a passport until you\u0027d completed your military service. And by then, the war had broken out. Egyptian judge Fouad Riad questioned why he kept enlisting in the army.",
        "Erdemovic grew increasingly frustrated at the judges\u0027 questioning. He cried several times on the stand. At one point, he and the French judge Claude Jorda began shouting at each other in their native languages, neither one waiting for translation.",
        "We don\u0027t know the history, and we have the devil of a time pronouncing the names.",
        "Erdemovic even pulled up his shirt to show the two-foot scar on his belly, the result of several operations to repair damage done by his comrade\u0027s bullets. Judge Jorda was unmoved.",
        "Prosecutors say they never would have known what had happened to those 1,200 victims if Erdemovic had not come forward. Yet the tribunal judges sentenced him to 10 years behind bars for his role in the killings, dismissing his claims that he had no choice but to shoot. The judges said they only had his word on it.",
        "So here, the tribunal has sentenced its first war criminal, a kid they have in custody only because he chose to come forward and tell his story. And yet, the colonel who gave the orders to shoot hasn\u0027t even been charged with a crime. And while General Ratko Mladic, the military men at the top, has been indicted, he, like dozens of other indicted war criminals, remains a free man.",
        "Is this justice, punishing only the small fish? Louise Arbour, the Canadian chief prosecutor at the tribunal, gets angry when Erdemovic is described as a little fish.",
        "Which brings us to the biggest problem facing the tribunal. Unlike most criminal justice systems, the tribunal has no police force of its own. And so it has no way of bringing fugitives to justice. The Yugoslav tribunal has indicted 75 people so far. One has died, seven are in custody, and the rest are working and living free in the former Yugoslavia.",
        "Under the Dayton Accord, the Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian governments are supposed to hand over indicted war criminals living in their territories. With rare exceptions, this hasn\u0027t happened. Under Dayton, NATO troops are also authorized to make arrests of any indicted war criminals they encounter. The joke at the tribunal is that NATO troops have to cross the street not to run into them.",
        "If the international community doesn\u0027t follow through with its commitment to the tribunal, if indicted war criminals are allowed to remain free, it sends exactly the opposite message from the one Americans at the tribunal were hoping to send. It says, essentially, that future Karadzics and Mladics can commit any atrocities they want, and the world won\u0027t bother to bring them to justice.",
        "The Dutch, like most Europeans, are not a particularly church-going people. Every small town boasts of a beautiful cathedral, but it\u0027s usually empty. When a holiday called [? Tweede ?] Pinksteren rolled around one Monday, none of the locals in the court knew it was, and we foreigners had to consultant a liturgical calendar to find out it was the second day of Pentecost.",
        "So here in the midst of this rather secular society is a trial about another society, where religious divisions became a matter of life and death. And in this setting, those who come to work every day at the tribunal are the truly faithful. The world community won\u0027t arrest the criminals they indict, those who fought the war don\u0027t seem particularly interested in the truth about it, the international media ignores what they\u0027re doing, but still, the lawyers and the judges come in and examine evidence, they work on their cases, true believers in the idea that the rule of law is the only way to create a lasting peace.",
        "Sitting there day after day, I remembered an old Islamic proverb that says one hour of doing justice is worth 100 in prayer. They come to this brick temple of a courthouse every day to do their praying by working for justice, even if no one hears their prayer.",
        "But Judge McDonald also brings to the tribunal another American attribute-- her idealism."

They got into an argument. The boy said, \"Why don\u0027t you just hit me? Go ahead, hit me.\" And she did. She slugged him in the arm, and the boy called 911.",

She\u0027s not been shamed. In her neighborhood, fighting is an everyday thing, a way of life, a way of staying alive. Nobody understood what she was saying.",

I watch her sit down at a long wooden table, surrounded by social workers and police officers, and her body is there, but she is gone, checked out, no longer present for the proceedings. She just isn\u0027t going to listen anymore. I can go in and sit down and watch as the administrators try to see whether she understands her sentence, as they try to get through to her, but I don\u0027t.",

In Tucson, the recidivism rate for kids who go through teen court is only 8%, compared with 37% for kids who go through regular juvenile court for similar minor offenses. The social workers, judges, lawyers, and the policemen who work and volunteer for teen court are convinced that it\u0027s a good program. They surround the kids with attention, try to show them that they care, that there\u0027s a whole community that cares.",
        "But if you ask them why it works, they usually say it\u0027s the jury process of having the kids explain themselves and their actions to a jury of their peers, other teenagers, and then hearing their response, that this has an unusual, even amazing, rehabilitative effect. In this case, however, this part of the process seems to be more about shame.",
        "In theory, if things were to go as planned, the boy as offender, as breaker of the law, should tell the jury that he recognizes his responsibility for the offense and its consequences, and apologize, and say he\u0027ll try not to do it again. But instead, up on the stand, he decides that maybe he wasn\u0027t so wrong in calling 911, that this wasn\u0027t the first time his mother hit him, and she hits his little brother, too.",
        "This is a mistake, and in her closing argument, the prosecutor asks the jury to remember that the boy is not sorry, that he isn\u0027t admitting his responsibility.",
        "The jury is comprised of eight teenagers. Seven of them have been in teen court before as defendants, and they\u0027re serving jury duty as part of their sentences. The eighth juror is a girl who\u0027s doing this for credit at her private school. She\u0027s eager to be the foreman of the jury. She speaks right up and asks if there are any objections to her being the foreperson, and no one objects, of course, so she gets right down to it.",
        "I\u0027m guilty. One minute into the first trial the prosecuting attorney stands up to examine the witness. She\u0027s beautiful, a knockout blond in a tight black cashmere sweater. She\u0027s maybe 17, but in teen court, everyone has a role to play, and she plays the prosecutor very well.",
        "They launch into a discussion where they say all the things that adults usually say about teenagers.",
        "This girl is 13 years old, and really petite. She\u0027s been in teen court twice already, once for possession of marijuana, and again for hitting her mother-- domestic violence.",
        "She\u0027s the only jurist to try to see things from the boy\u0027s point of view, most likely because she\u0027s been there. She really is his peer. She gets into a lot of trouble, and fights with her mother. She argues for the defendant, but the others will have none of it. He\u0027s guilty and he\u0027s not sorry. He needs to be taught a lesson.",
        "Surprisingly, it turns out that the petite girl, even though she seems to understand the boy, she\u0027s willing to punish him just as much as any of the others. I ask her how she would help the boy, and she says she\u0027d put him in juvenile jail.",
        "Have you been to juvie?",
        "Why is that a good thing? Why would it be a good thing for him?",
        "I\u0027ve been told that teenage juries are notoriously more harsh in their sentencing than regular juvenile court judges, that perhaps this is because teenagers are being asked to act as adults, and they know from experience how adults act in these situations. Adults punish. Or perhaps, the kids, from experience, know what really works is to make it hurt.",
        "The organizers and administrators of teen court try to discourage the idea of punishment. They try, instead, to encourage corrective sentencing that will help the kids, teach them, not hurt them. There\u0027s the minimum sentence, consisting of jury duty, letters of apology, and a basic course in responsible decision-making.",
        "But the jury can, if it decides the defendant needs additional corrections, require that he perform manual labor, such as painting over graffiti, or making him attend and successfully complete a self-esteem workshop, five one-and-a-half-hour sessions in which they learn skills for non-violent problem solving, and increasing belief in internal versus external control-over-life events. Topics include identification and expression of emotions, anger, safety planning, and personal power.",
        "In this case, the case of the false report, since they cannot send the boy to prison, they send him to self-esteem workshops, two for good measure, and give him a day\u0027s labor in the community garden.",
        "The next trial concerns a 13-year-old who was caught with a smoking bowl, a marijuana pipe out behind the school. He\u0027s been suspended for five weeks, and his dad tells me this is excessive punishment, not constructive at all, because his son is just missing out on his classes, just sits at home all day. He says he thinks the teen court system is a good thing, better than the juvenile court, but basically, he just doesn\u0027t like seeing his son put through the wringer by anyone other than himself.",
        "On the stand, his son says he\u0027s sorry, that he knows he did something wrong. He gets emotional, nearly starts crying, and I look over at his dad, and he\u0027s just hating it. His son is 13 years old and big for his age. His son is 13 years old and starting to be a man, and his son has just been shamed in public.",
        "This time, in the jury room, nearly everyone is in favor of letting the defendant off easy. The private school girl wants to send him to self-esteem classes, but no one else seems to agree.",
        "There\u0027s a jury monitor in the room, a professional social worker who\u0027s overseeing the deliberation, and it seems like things are not going in the direction she\u0027d hoped for. She tries to move the kids to a decision by taking a vote. She counts four in favor of self-esteem and four against. But I count four against, one in favor, and three who will not say one way or the other.",
        "It turns into a discussion about who needs self-esteem, how to measure it, and that maybe they don\u0027t even know what self-esteem means. Then the little girl comes up with an idea. She asks if the defendant has ever tried to commit suicide.",
        "The boy on the stand is 12, still with baby fat, hair slicked back to look cool. His crime was to file a false report to 911, said his mom was hitting him.",
        "While the social worker\u0027s out of the room, I ask the kids what they really think about marijuana.",
        "What do the rest of you think? You\u0027ve been busted for marijuana.",
        "So is this a bad person? Is this guy a bad person for smoking?",
        "The one girl who\u0027s an outsider here, the one who goes to a private school, she doesn\u0027t let up, and it becomes clear that everyone else is turning against her.",
        "The social worker comes back in the room and tells them that the defendant has never tried to kill himself, and because his self-esteem seems intact, because his crime is one most of the jurors have committed themselves, because they are united against the private school girl, they give him the minimum sentence.",
        "In the third trial, a 14-year-old girl is on the stand for physically assaulting a former friend. The former friend had been spreading a rumor that she, the friend, had slept with the 14-year-old girl\u0027s boyfriend. She said the boyfriend got her pregnant.",
        "The 14-year-old told her to stop, but she did it again to another boy, and another girlfriend. So the 14-year-old girl went over to her house, pulled her by her hair off the front steps and into the yard, and punched her in the face. Her defense attorney tries to get her to say she\u0027s sorry, that she won\u0027t do it again."

Americans make up the largest legal community at the tribunal. The contingent is so large, some complain that through sheer numbers, they\u0027re turning what\u0027s supposed to be a brand-new legal system into something that looks a lot like US Constitutional law.",
            "Most of the Americans are here out of a sense of moral conviction. Alan Tieger, like Judge McDonald, was a civil rights lawyer. He was one of the prosecutors at the federal Rodney King beating trial. His parents were Holocaust survivors. The prosecution\u0027s chief investigator, Terree Bowers, says he came to the Hague to do work of significance to humankind. But from the start, his new job presented challenges he never faced in his old position as head of the US Attorney\u0027s Office in Los Angeles.",
            "There were all sorts of challenges. And one thing in particular that Americans, and other non-Yugoslavs at the tribunal found so very difficult to understand-- the now familiar stories of neighbor turning against neighbor, almost overnight. Judge McDonald asked witness after witness about this, over and over again.",
            "She never found an answer that satisfied her. And as the trial wore on, she and other judges found themselves searching for something in their own experiences to explain it. And that raises this question, what does it mean when people with one sort of history are trying and judging people with a very different sort?",
            "It was back in May of 1993 that the United Nations Security Council set up the tribunal at the urging of the US and Western Europe. At the time, NATO was resisting pleas from the Bosnians to come to their aid in the war, and cynics suggested that the West set up the tribunal simply because it was easier to commit lawyers than troops.",
            "Again, Judge McDonald.",
            "But to see just how difficult it is to make a contribution, consider the case of Witness L. The tribunal allows witnesses who fear for their lives to testify behind closed doors, their identities secret. Witness L explained to the tribunal that he was a guard at one of the Serb-run prison camps, where he witnessed the tribunal\u0027s first defendant, a Bosnian Serb karate teacher named Dusan Tadic, commit more crimes.",
            "The prosecution had other witnesses who told of Tadic delivering brutal beatings, but L was the only credible witness who saw Tadic rape and kill people. L testified about one incident where 10 elderly men were taken into the infamous white house, the scene of most tortures at the Omarska prison camp.",
            "According to L, Tadic pointed to him and said, \"Come here and perform the killing of these 10 prisoners.\" L answered, \"Why me? Why do I have to do it?\" Tadic apparently grew impatient. L said Tadic approached the prisoners and shot two of them in the head, point blank. It was dramatic, damning testimony, the strongest brought forward by the prosecution.",
            "Unfortunately, it wasn\u0027t true. Two months after L\u0027s initial court appearance, prosecutors had to stand before the court and admit that L had lied on the stand. He had never been a camp guard. He\u0027d never witnessed the alleged atrocities. He\u0027d never even seen Dusan Tadic in person until he walked into the courtroom. Prosecution investigator Robert Reid told the court L was a Bosnian Serb soldier. He said he\u0027d been caught by the Bosnian Muslim army, and then was coerced into testifying.",
            "In the weeks since then, the prosecution says it\u0027s uncovered new evidence that shows the Bosnian Serb government didn\u0027t coach Witness L. At this point, it\u0027s unclear what to believe of his testimony, and the whole episode raises disturbing questions for the Americans and Western Europeans who first pushed for the establishment of the international criminal tribunal.",
            "Gabrielle Kirk McDonald is arguably the most powerful African-American woman in the world, but you\u0027ve probably never heard of her. McDonald is the presiding judge for the first international war crimes trial in half a century. As she sits in her judicial robes week after week inside the courtroom, it becomes clear that Judge McDonald is like most Americans when it comes to things foreign. We can\u0027t read the maps.",
            "If these trials were designed to get at the truth, they were being tainted by a witness who lied. If they were trying to bring justice to the victims, it was those victims-- the Muslims, in this case-- who were fabricating evidence, trying to swing the verdict their way.",
            "Thus far, the tribunal has only handed down one sentence. It\u0027s a case where no one disputes the basic facts of the crime. This was the case of Drazen Erdemovic. It\u0027s a story of a man who risked his life and his freedom to tell the world the truth about what he\u0027d done.",
            "Erdemovic is 25, a baby-faced kid with acne scars. He\u0027s Croatian. His wife is a Serb. They have a young son. Erdemovic was trained as a tool and dye maker. But by the time he had learned his trade, the war had broken out, so he became a career soldier, and served with all three armies during the war. But he says he chose combat units that conducted reconnaissance missions and manned border checkpoints, jobs where he didn\u0027t have to kill anyone.",
            "Until July of 1995, that\u0027s when his special battalion of the Bosnian Serb army, the 10th sabotage unit, was ordered to a farm field near Pilica. It was shortly after the fall of Srebrenica. The UN had set up a safe area there, where 25,000 Bosnian Muslims had fled for protection. But when the Bosnian Serb army attacked, the tiny UN force didn\u0027t offer much resistance. In fact, UN peacekeepers helped load Muslim men onto buses that took them away, never to be seen again.",
            "Erdemovic and his unit had been given instructions on how to kill large numbers of people in a short period of time. And then the buses started arriving. The first group of 10 wore blindfolds, their hands tied behind their backs. Erdemovic and his comrades were then ordered to shoot the prisoners in the back.",
            "But Erdemovic emptied his rifle again and again, killing as many as 100 of the 1,200 killed that day.",
            "Erdemovic\u0027s unit was then ordered to a nearby town where, perhaps, 500 other Bosnian Muslims were being held inside a meeting hall. He and his unit were ordered to kill them as well. Erdemovic says, this time, he did refuse, saying, wasn\u0027t there enough blood? Weren\u0027t there enough dead people? Erdemovic says he didn\u0027t care what happened to himself anymore. He told American prosecutor Mark Harmon, \"I didn\u0027t want to become a robot for extermination.\"",
            "Erdemovic\u0027s refusal to kill again did not go unnoticed by his comrades. A few days later, in a bar fight, one of them shot him four times. Erdemovic says it was because they knew he couldn\u0027t keep his mouth shut. And he couldn\u0027t. Erdemovic says after the massacre, he couldn\u0027t sleep. He stayed away from home and drank. After he had partially recovered from the gunshot wounds, he says he finally decided to tell his story to the war crimes tribunal. But there was no tribunal representative anywhere nearby.",
            "So he went to the American embassy in Belgrade. They gave him a list of news agencies. He called the first one on the list and told his story to a stringer for ABC News. Unfortunately, the phones were tapped, and the reporter\u0027s tapes were confiscated at the airport. Erdemovic was quickly arrested, but not before he had talked to another reporter with the Paris daily paper, Le Figaro. His story of the Pilica massacre was translated and retold all over the world. Erdemovic eventually made his way to the tribunal, where he told his story again.",
            "Judges deciding his case had a difficult time understanding how Erdemovic got himself into such a no-win situation. Why didn\u0027t he just flee the country? Erdemovic explained, you couldn\u0027t get a passport until you\u0027d completed your military service. And by then, the war had broken out. Egyptian judge Fouad Riad questioned why he kept enlisting in the army.",
            "Erdemovic grew increasingly frustrated at the judges\u0027 questioning. He cried several times on the stand. At one point, he and the French judge Claude Jorda began shouting at each other in their native languages, neither one waiting for translation.",
            "We don\u0027t know the history, and we have the devil of a time pronouncing the names.",
            "Erdemovic even pulled up his shirt to show the two-foot scar on his belly, the result of several operations to repair damage done by his comrade\u0027s bullets. Judge Jorda was unmoved.",
            "Prosecutors say they never would have known what had happened to those 1,200 victims if Erdemovic had not come forward. Yet the tribunal judges sentenced him to 10 years behind bars for his role in the killings, dismissing his claims that he had no choice but to shoot. The judges said they only had his word on it.",
            "So here, the tribunal has sentenced its first war criminal, a kid they have in custody only because he chose to come forward and tell his story. And yet, the colonel who gave the orders to shoot hasn\u0027t even been charged with a crime. And while General Ratko Mladic, the military men at the top, has been indicted, he, like dozens of other indicted war criminals, remains a free man.",
            "Is this justice, punishing only the small fish? Louise Arbour, the Canadian chief prosecutor at the tribunal, gets angry when Erdemovic is described as a little fish.",
            "Which brings us to the biggest problem facing the tribunal. Unlike most criminal justice systems, the tribunal has no police force of its own. And so it has no way of bringing fugitives to justice. The Yugoslav tribunal has indicted 75 people so far. One has died, seven are in custody, and the rest are working and living free in the former Yugoslavia.",
            "Under the Dayton Accord, the Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian governments are supposed to hand over indicted war criminals living in their territories. With rare exceptions, this hasn\u0027t happened. Under Dayton, NATO troops are also authorized to make arrests of any indicted war criminals they encounter. The joke at the tribunal is that NATO troops have to cross the street not to run into them.",
            "If the international community doesn\u0027t follow through with its commitment to the tribunal, if indicted war criminals are allowed to remain free, it sends exactly the opposite message from the one Americans at the tribunal were hoping to send. It says, essentially, that future Karadzics and Mladics can commit any atrocities they want, and the world won\u0027t bother to bring them to justice.",
            "The Dutch, like most Europeans, are not a particularly church-going people. Every small town boasts of a beautiful cathedral, but it\u0027s usually empty. When a holiday called [? Tweede ?] Pinksteren rolled around one Monday, none of the locals in the court knew it was, and we foreigners had to consultant a liturgical calendar to find out it was the second day of Pentecost.",
            "So here in the midst of this rather secular society is a trial about another society, where religious divisions became a matter of life and death. And in this setting, those who come to work every day at the tribunal are the truly faithful. The world community won\u0027t arrest the criminals they indict, those who fought the war don\u0027t seem particularly interested in the truth about it, the international media ignores what they\u0027re doing, but still, the lawyers and the judges come in and examine evidence, they work on their cases, true believers in the idea that the rule of law is the only way to create a lasting peace.",
            "Sitting there day after day, I remembered an old Islamic proverb that says one hour of doing justice is worth 100 in prayer. They come to this brick temple of a courthouse every day to do their praying by working for justice, even if no one hears their prayer.",
            "But Judge McDonald also brings to the tribunal another American attribute-- her idealism."

            "Act One. Well, ever since the end of World War II, there\u0027s been this idealistic notion kicking around that when nations do horrible things, the best way to deal with it, to put those things to rest, would be to have a court somewhere, a court for war crimes, for crimes against humanity. And now, for the first time since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of World War II, a court like this is actually in session. This is the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.",
            "Just like the Nuremberg trials, this is justice administered by outsiders. These trials are happening far from the Balkans. They\u0027re in the Hague, in the Netherlands. There are lawyers and judges from Egypt, and France, and Sri Lanka, and Canada, and lots of Americans there. Kitty Felde is a familiar voice to public radio listeners for her coverage of the O. J. Simpson trial and the Rodney King beating trial, but over the course of the last year, she spent several weeks in the Hague, watching this new form of justice take place.",
            "That story by Kitty Felde. There\u0027s this remarkable essay about war crimes trials and national truth commissions by Michael Ignatieff, in the current issue of Index on Censorship. Ignatieff is writing a book on truth and national reconciliation, and he\u0027s examining the war crimes trial in the Hague, and the one in Rwanda, and the truth commissions in Argentina, and Chile, and South Africa, the situation in Ireland. And in this essay, he writes, \"It\u0027s open to question whether justice or truth actually heals. For one thing,\" he says, \"what you see as the truth depends on who you are.\"",
            "He tells this story. In June of 1996, he was asked to chair a discussion of historians from Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia. And all of these had been people who had opposed the war. Most of them, in fact, had been close friends before the war. And they hadn\u0027t given in to the national hatreds inflamed by the war. They\u0027d remained friends. It was about 30 people.",
            "So what do you make of this notion of the Americans and the other foreigners who are holding the tribunal that, OK, we\u0027re going to get at the truth?",
            "Right, but it\u0027s just a first step.",
            "It\u0027s such an interesting contrast to a place like South Africa where, as you point out in your essay, you have former adversaries actually sitting down trying to create a government, trying to create a nation where all sides are represented. And so when they sit down and hold a truth commission themselves, not outsiders but they, themselves, because they are ready to reconcile and have been part of a process of reconciliation, there\u0027s a place for that truth to go. It can actually have an effect. There\u0027s a readiness for it.",
            "In his essay, Michael Ignatieff raises this question. To come to terms with the past, do entire nations have to go through the same psychological processes that a person goes through when they face the past? In other words, does there have to be a moment of admitting the truth, of admitting guilt, of feeling shame? We look at a few of those moments, in a very different setting, in a minute, when our program continues."

            "And I got them around a table, and I asked them, at one point, don\u0027t you think it would be possible for you all to get together and produce a history of the war that is a simple narrative of how this catastrophe happened to your three societies? There was a kind of deafening silence after I made this liberal, well-meaning proposal.",
            "And people then just said, a common history is impossible. We couldn\u0027t do it. We couldn\u0027t even agree what events should be included. We couldn\u0027t even agree on when the war began. I mean, some people think the war began in June 1991 when the JNA tanks marched into Slovenia. Other people think the war began in \u002785 and \u002786 when Serbian nationalism began to take off.",
            "Even simple factual questions become, in other words, questions of attribution of responsibility and questions of guilt. I mean, it\u0027ll take generations, and I\u0027m not sure that outsiders can do it. It\u0027s like a family trauma. And as a family, they will have to talk it out. But it will take 30, 40, 50 years.",
            "Well, I don\u0027t want to be cynical about that, because I think juridical truth is terribly important. And here, I think, outsiders can play a limited role, because an outsider can say, here are the forensic facts about certain war crimes, and we can establish them. An international tribunal can establish what war crimes happened, where, by whom, and to whom.",
            "There\u0027s no guarantee that that truth will then reach out through the society at large, but at least it constitutes one kind of place, somewhere, where honest men can find what actually happened.",
            "Absolutely a first step. And it would be naive to think that when the tribunal winds up its work in so many years\u0027 time, and all the volumes of evidence are published, that this is of itself going to make much difference. I mean, the really scary thing is the sense in which in a lot of Serbian society and Croatian society, the conclusions and even the evidence of the Hague are discounted before it\u0027s even heard, as being, you know, this kind of alien enemy, nobody understands this but ourselves, that kind of line. You know, no one understands the Serbs but the Serbs, no one understands the Croats but the Croats, no one understands the Muslims but the Muslims, and therefore, anything that an international tribunal says to them has to be wrong.",
            "Yes. The tragedy in the Balkans is that, at the moment, there\u0027s no place for the truth to go, because the regimes that are in power, all of them-- and I include the Muslim side-- are not regimes which really allow, and welcome, and let the truth circulate freely. And until they are, the Hague tribunal will be crying in the wilderness."

            "This trial has a different jury. When they debate, no one mentions the statement by the defendant, that in her neighborhood, fighting is an everyday thing, no big deal, really. It either just flew over their heads, or it doesn\u0027t make any difference to them.",
            "The most important thing to them is that the defendant feels no remorse, has suffered no shame. And like the first jury, somehow they\u0027re certain that shame is the essential ingredient, the first step in changing the criminal into a good citizen.",
            "The mother tells me her son is a Tohono O\u0027odham Indian, that she adopted him when he was five, and that he\u0027s always been angry-- angry at her, angry at a lot of things. They got into an argument. The boy said, \"Why don\u0027t you just hit me? Go ahead, hit me.\" And she did. She slugged him in the arm, and the boy called 911.",
            "Most members of the jury have already been through the workshops. They know what the right answer is. They get excited as they write the comments to the defendants.",
            "After they deliver the sentence, the defendant comes down off the stand, and I ask if she wants to talk to me for a little bit, but she looks at me as if she\u0027d like to rip my throat out, like, where\u0027s my knife when I need it. She\u0027s not been shamed. In her neighborhood, fighting is an everyday thing, a way of life, a way of staying alive. Nobody understood what she was saying.",
            "I follow her out of the courtroom and down the hallway, to the room where she\u0027ll have her exit interview. I watch her sit down at a long wooden table, surrounded by social workers and police officers, and her body is there, but she is gone, checked out, no longer present for the proceedings. She just isn\u0027t going to listen anymore. I can go in and sit down and watch as the administrators try to see whether she understands her sentence, as they try to get through to her, but I don\u0027t.",
            "There are about 250 teen courts in 30 states around the country, and their number is increasing rapidly, because they seem to work. In Tucson, the recidivism rate for kids who go through teen court is only 8%, compared with 37% for kids who go through regular juvenile court for similar minor offenses. The social workers, judges, lawyers, and the policemen who work and volunteer for teen court are convinced that it\u0027s a good program. They surround the kids with attention, try to show them that they care, that there\u0027s a whole community that cares.",
            "But if you ask them why it works, they usually say it\u0027s the jury process of having the kids explain themselves and their actions to a jury of their peers, other teenagers, and then hearing their response, that this has an unusual, even amazing, rehabilitative effect. In this case, however, this part of the process seems to be more about shame.",
            "In theory, if things were to go as planned, the boy as offender, as breaker of the law, should tell the jury that he recognizes his responsibility for the offense and its consequences, and apologize, and say he\u0027ll try not to do it again. But instead, up on the stand, he decides that maybe he wasn\u0027t so wrong in calling 911, that this wasn\u0027t the first time his mother hit him, and she hits his little brother, too.",
            "This is a mistake, and in her closing argument, the prosecutor asks the jury to remember that the boy is not sorry, that he isn\u0027t admitting his responsibility.",
            "The jury is comprised of eight teenagers. Seven of them have been in teen court before as defendants, and they\u0027re serving jury duty as part of their sentences. The eighth juror is a girl who\u0027s doing this for credit at her private school. She\u0027s eager to be the foreman of the jury. She speaks right up and asks if there are any objections to her being the foreperson, and no one objects, of course, so she gets right down to it.",
            "I\u0027m guilty. One minute into the first trial the prosecuting attorney stands up to examine the witness. She\u0027s beautiful, a knockout blond in a tight black cashmere sweater. She\u0027s maybe 17, but in teen court, everyone has a role to play, and she plays the prosecutor very well.",
            "They launch into a discussion where they say all the things that adults usually say about teenagers.",
            "This girl is 13 years old, and really petite. She\u0027s been in teen court twice already, once for possession of marijuana, and again for hitting her mother-- domestic violence.",
            "She\u0027s the only jurist to try to see things from the boy\u0027s point of view, most likely because she\u0027s been there. She really is his peer. She gets into a lot of trouble, and fights with her mother. She argues for the defendant, but the others will have none of it. He\u0027s guilty and he\u0027s not sorry. He needs to be taught a lesson.",
            "Surprisingly, it turns out that the petite girl, even though she seems to understand the boy, she\u0027s willing to punish him just as much as any of the others. I ask her how she would help the boy, and she says she\u0027d put him in juvenile jail.",
            "Have you been to juvie?",
            "Why is that a good thing? Why would it be a good thing for him?",
            "I\u0027ve been told that teenage juries are notoriously more harsh in their sentencing than regular juvenile court judges, that perhaps this is because teenagers are being asked to act as adults, and they know from experience how adults act in these situations. Adults punish. Or perhaps, the kids, from experience, know what really works is to make it hurt.",
            "The organizers and administrators of teen court try to discourage the idea of punishment. They try, instead, to encourage corrective sentencing that will help the kids, teach them, not hurt them. There\u0027s the minimum sentence, consisting of jury duty, letters of apology, and a basic course in responsible decision-making.",
            "But the jury can, if it decides the defendant needs additional corrections, require that he perform manual labor, such as painting over graffiti, or making him attend and successfully complete a self-esteem workshop, five one-and-a-half-hour sessions in which they learn skills for non-violent problem solving, and increasing belief in internal versus external control-over-life events. Topics include identification and expression of emotions, anger, safety planning, and personal power.",
            "In this case, the case of the false report, since they cannot send the boy to prison, they send him to self-esteem workshops, two for good measure, and give him a day\u0027s labor in the community garden.",
            "The next trial concerns a 13-year-old who was caught with a smoking bowl, a marijuana pipe out behind the school. He\u0027s been suspended for five weeks, and his dad tells me this is excessive punishment, not constructive at all, because his son is just missing out on his classes, just sits at home all day. He says he thinks the teen court system is a good thing, better than the juvenile court, but basically, he just doesn\u0027t like seeing his son put through the wringer by anyone other than himself.",
            "On the stand, his son says he\u0027s sorry, that he knows he did something wrong. He gets emotional, nearly starts crying, and I look over at his dad, and he\u0027s just hating it. His son is 13 years old and big for his age. His son is 13 years old and starting to be a man, and his son has just been shamed in public.",
            "This time, in the jury room, nearly everyone is in favor of letting the defendant off easy. The private school girl wants to send him to self-esteem classes, but no one else seems to agree.",
            "There\u0027s a jury monitor in the room, a professional social worker who\u0027s overseeing the deliberation, and it seems like things are not going in the direction she\u0027d hoped for. She tries to move the kids to a decision by taking a vote. She counts four in favor of self-esteem and four against. But I count four against, one in favor, and three who will not say one way or the other.",
            "It turns into a discussion about who needs self-esteem, how to measure it, and that maybe they don\u0027t even know what self-esteem means. Then the little girl comes up with an idea. She asks if the defendant has ever tried to commit suicide.",
            "The boy on the stand is 12, still with baby fat, hair slicked back to look cool. His crime was to file a false report to 911, said his mom was hitting him.",
            "While the social worker\u0027s out of the room, I ask the kids what they really think about marijuana.",
            "What do the rest of you think? You\u0027ve been busted for marijuana.",
            "So is this a bad person? Is this guy a bad person for smoking?",
            "The one girl who\u0027s an outsider here, the one who goes to a private school, she doesn\u0027t let up, and it becomes clear that everyone else is turning against her.",
            "The social worker comes back in the room and tells them that the defendant has never tried to kill himself, and because his self-esteem seems intact, because his crime is one most of the jurors have committed themselves, because they are united against the private school girl, they give him the minimum sentence.",
            "In the third trial, a 14-year-old girl is on the stand for physically assaulting a former friend. The former friend had been spreading a rumor that she, the friend, had slept with the 14-year-old girl\u0027s boyfriend. She said the boyfriend got her pregnant.",
            "The 14-year-old told her to stop, but she did it again to another boy, and another girlfriend. So the 14-year-old girl went over to her house, pulled her by her hair off the front steps and into the yard, and punched her in the face. Her defense attorney tries to get her to say she\u0027s sorry, that she won\u0027t do it again."
