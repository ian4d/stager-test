I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at The Waffle House.","For me, it was the worst part, having to give myself shots. For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through.","December 1. After three days on the road, we make it to Omaha.","The first week in Omaha felt like boot camp. I shuffled from one test to another.","And I didn\u0027t like Kathy\u0027s cheerleading.","So I settled for the occasional phone call.","The American Cancer Society offers classes in how you can look better and feel better. And though it sounded hokey at the time, now I understand why they do this. Getting sick really played havoc with my body image. I felt as if my body had betrayed me like a separate person I couldn\u0027t trust. My sexual desire went out the window. I figured I wouldn\u0027t mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn\u0027t hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was like looking at a Holocaust victim, all skin and bones. Actually, I\u0027ve always been tiny and scrawny, but I never minded before. So I avoided mirrors and wore a hat even when the weather got warm. I did break down and let Tom style the little bit of fuzz that was still left on my head.","My room looks like you could wash it down with a hose, like a vet\u0027s examining room. It\u0027s an awful mustardy yellow. It overlooks a graveyard. I\u0027m here for five days while they pour deadly medicines into my veins.","In the hospital, there\u0027s the official information that the staff doles out, and there\u0027s the unofficial grapevine, tips and advice that patients share with each other. From the veteran patients, I hear that the University of Nebraska Medical Center doesn\u0027t like to give out Zofran, an anti-nausea drug that\u0027s very expensive but works like a charm when you\u0027re getting chemotherapy. So I start to insist on it to everyone I see. I tell the nurses--","--the resident--","--and the head doctor.","Despite my requests, my demands, my begging, the first night, they fail to give me Zofran, and like Graham, my jaw stiffens up, a side effect of a cheaper, less effective anti-nausea drug. It\u0027s a reminder of what it means to be a patient. You can ask, but sometimes you have very little power.","During my high dose chemo, I find out that Graham is back in the hospital on a ventilator. They think he has pneumonia and sepsis, an infection of the blood that is common in hospitals and quite serious for transplant patients. Tom and Dan keep giving me updates about Graham\u0027s condition, but I don\u0027t really want to know.","The staff really did try to help me cope, and I did appreciate how genuinely nice Midwesterners are. But sometimes I just couldn\u0027t get with the program.","What worked for me was to work. One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but as a patient, I had to be a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics. And for support, I had Tom, who I call [? Zuli, ?] and he was a huge comfort to me.","Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something, we just sort of called a truce or something, each of us did. We almost never fight now. Both of us pretty much kind of let things just slide. If I\u0027m pissed off about something, I just sort of say, oh well. He does the same, I think.","Of course we did have our moments.","January 20. It\u0027s a big day for Bill Clinton and for me too. He\u0027s being sworn in for his second term. I\u0027m getting my stem cells back. They call it day zero because the recovery starts here. Tom and Dan keep trying to get me to say something profound like, getting my stem cells back is like getting my life back. It\u0027s true without these stem cells I would die. The chemo wiped out my body\u0027s ability to make blood cells. But I\u0027m feeling too lousy to wax poetic.","But over the next few days, as the chemo destroys my immune system, I feel as rotten as I\u0027ve ever felt. This is rock bottom. And without the energy that comes from blood cells, I feel fragile, anxious, and empty.","There\u0027s some comfort in knowing that I\u0027m supposed to feel this way. The chemo can\u0027t distinguish between healthy cells and the cancer, so it wipes out everything that grows fast-- the lining of the digestive tract, the blood cells, hair follicles. One patient who has just been through it assures me it will pass.","Though my recovery was supposed to be outpatient, two days after the transplant, I\u0027m back in the hospital.","That has stayed with me in a way that nothing else has because it\u0027s like losing your innocence or something. I mean, it just seems like this weird thing. My heart isn\u0027t supposed to ever stop, and my heart has been stopped. And to me, that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It\u0027s almost like everything else is OK, but that really gets me somehow. I wish that hadn\u0027t happened.","Just down the hall, Graham has been on a respirator for more than a week. After Graham\u0027s 8-year-old old daughter, Kelli, plays her flute for him, he seems to show some slight improvement, but the doctors say he\u0027s still in critical condition.","Then we say goodbye to Lorraine.","Her husband, Graham, is still on a respirator. She tells us that she\u0027s losing hope.","I tell her to be optimistic, but I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m saying this. In my heart, I know she\u0027s right to prepare herself for Graham\u0027s death. It\u0027s not a good scene. Here I am leaving, getting out of town alive, and Lorraine\u0027s world is falling apart. I feel terrible for her, but mostly I want to get the hell out of here. I want to run. Still I hug her, and I tell her not to lose hope.","I want to believe, and I think I basically do believe that this whole ordeal did not impact Griffy in a bad way. And I think that it didn\u0027t.","February 3. I\u0027ve been home four days when I call back to Omaha to see how Graham is doing.","Springtime. The buds on the maple tree outside our bedroom window have begun to sprout, and so has my hair. I call this tree my hair tree because since I\u0027ve been having chemo, my hair has fallen out and grown back at the same time the tree has lost its leaves and sprouted new ones.","It\u0027s funny when you realize you\u0027re going to get your life back, that your job isn\u0027t just fighting a disease anymore. Suddenly you have to live. Egad. You can\u0027t just sit around and wait to be better. You\u0027ve got to go back to work or at least do something. Study biology, write a book. That was very strange and difficult for me at first, because for the past year and a half, I\u0027d been doing very little. Reading, resting, looking through catalogs. I was scared to go back to work, to face getting dressed every day, to be busy, on deadline, frantic, to let my orderly life and my time with Griffin get away from me.","One year since my transplant. The tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease is gone. I\u0027m back at work, but my energy is still low. I\u0027m tired a lot, and when Griffin gets sick with a cold, I get sick too. And I get it bad. Still, we go on vacation. Tom and I went to Rome this fall. We see friends, make dinner. We even fight. And though my life is pretty good, I don\u0027t feel ecstatic, but I feel content. And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick."],"spokenWords":["January 20.

Bye-bye.","There are at least three reasons why I was supposed to be exempt from getting seriously sick. First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he\u0027s supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don\u0027t think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I\u0027m a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they\u0027re affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people.","And they\u0027re off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?","OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches.","We\u0027re in the bathroom of The Waffle House. Did you lock the door?","And I\u0027m going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It\u0027s just like being a heroine addict.","And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that\u0027s it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I\u0027d do it at like 7:25, right before Seinfeld. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I\u0027d miss Seinfeld. So I\u0027d hurry myself along. Now I\u0027m doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House. So I give myself a treat afterwards.","Mmm! Waffle House. Chicken melt. Oh, boy.","I\u0027m feeling pretty rotten from the ill effects of my final round of chemotherapy back in Washington. They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn\u0027t in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this, my bladder hurts and I\u0027m tired. And I\u0027m about to embark on a nasty, exhausting journey. I feel as if I need more strength, but here we go.","OK.","Endless poking and prodding.","I\u0027m just tired of being poked and prodded and pricked and achy and tired. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can\u0027t imagine it being any worse.","Kathy Byar was my nurse coordinator. She seemed more interested in keeping me on schedule than in what I was going through. We called her my drill sergeant.","I\u0027m a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren\u0027t used to pushy New Yorkers in Omaha.","You\u0027ve got to get me on a later schedule. I\u0027m too exhausted.","I just wasn\u0027t in the mood, you know? I\u0027d been through a lot already. And I was tired. I remember she would say, positive attitude, positive attitude. And I just felt like hell, you know? I had a positive attitude the first time around, and it didn\u0027t work. I mean, now I was going through something even worse. And it was hard for me to keep positive.","One coping mechanism I did have was to act like a health reporter. I was obsessed with the numbers. It was really important for me to know the odds that the transplant would work. Those odds were about 50-50. So sometimes, sitting in a room with other patients, I couldn\u0027t help but think that only about half of us were going to make it. And this made it kind of hard to get close to people. But Graham and his family was an exception.","Graham was a young father facing worse odds than me.","His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their 9-month-old redheaded son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn\u0027t there. He was older than Thomas. He was nearly a year and a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much. And I didn\u0027t want him to have to understand anything.","Hi, Griffy! Hi, Griffy!","Hey, Griffy, want me to sing \"Macaroni\"? I have a little pony. His name is Macaroni. He trots and trots and then he stops. My funny little pony, Macaroni. Do you like that song, Griffy?","I don\u0027t know. In a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself from him, because I know I have to go through this and do this. And it\u0027s sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real. So a lot of times I don\u0027t have the energy for him, and that makes it easier to kind of separate from him.","Griffy, I miss you. I\u0027ll see you soon. I love you. I love you, Griffy.","December 10. We get some bad news. The CAT scan shows the most recent round of chemotherapy back in Washington hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor nearly at all. Julie Vose is my doctor in Omaha.","The good news is I\u0027m actually feeling much better. So that night, we celebrate.","We\u0027re even out at a restaurant. Not just any restaurant, but a find of a restaurant, this Catfish Lodge here in Omaha, with the white albino catfish in the tank in the middle. I\u0027m actually feeling good tonight. It\u0027s like a miracle. I haven\u0027t felt like this. I\u0027m not, like, crying or in pain or something.","Two days later, I begin the Omaha chemo.","They give you four drugs, and one of them is blue. I kind of like the blue one, because it\u0027s just so startling. It looks like blue food coloring kind of color or like blueberry frozen popsicle melted.","Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison.","Don\u0027t be doing the top.","Those are famous last words.","I just had a CT scan. They\u0027re looking to compare the tumor in the chest to how it was in October, see if it\u0027s shrunk.","The blue chemo hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor either. So finally it\u0027s time to get on with the bone marrow transplant.","I mean, it\u0027s discouraging that the tumor hasn\u0027t shrunk any. I was hoping it would shrink with these last bunch of chemos. I\u0027m just anxious to get done. And I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s really going to work. And I\u0027m kind of wondering about what\u0027s the chances it\u0027s really going to work. They can\u0027t be as good as they would be if the tumor had shrunk a lot.","Mm-hmm.","The consent form is a reminder of what I\u0027m in for. It lists all sorts of nasty things that could and sometimes do happen when you have a bone marrow transplant-- kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure.","It didn\u0027t help to see the transplant patients who were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going, and they looked so weak shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well.","People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. There are the ones who get their chemo and get out, and there are the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter, a lot of patients have gotten influenza. They\u0027re on respirators, and they\u0027re taking a long time to recover. There is a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean, cozy apartment we have rented. I sit on the rose-covered couch and watch the sparrows out the window. It\u0027s very cold.","As we wait, I\u0027m thinking about what\u0027s going to happen. Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It\u0027s the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha.","Hi, I\u0027m supposed to be admitted.","Rebecca Perl.","I think of it kind of like a pregnancy, like having a child, like the birth. I mean, no one can tell you what it\u0027s going to be like. You kind of know it\u0027s going to be awful, or that\u0027s what a lot of people say. But nobody can really tell you what it\u0027s really going to be like, and everyone\u0027s experience is really different. And it\u0027s just sort of like, you don\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027re just going to do it. It\u0027s just going to happen. And I just sort of feel like with this it\u0027s the same thing. It\u0027s like this momentum, and it\u0027s just going to happen, and I\u0027m going to do it. I mean, it\u0027s scary, but I\u0027m just going to do it.","Everybody have fun tonight. Everybody--","Everybody have fun tonight.","I\u0027d like to have Zofran because that\u0027s worked for me in the past.","But I really do want Zofran, because I know that works for me.","I just feel like I\u0027ve said this to so many people so many times. I want to get Zofran every day.","I kind of like to be a little bit removed from how everybody else is doing.","Because it\u0027s scary. It\u0027s hard for me to hear every detail of how everyone else is doing because all that could be happening to me.","Twice, rabbis came into my room and left their business card, and told me if I ever wanted to talk. And it was very awkward because they were there to sort of try to, solicit important things out of me about how I was feeling. And I just didn\u0027t want to have any part of it. They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I\u0027d say, no. And then she would say, well, I don\u0027t mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I\u0027d say, no. And she\u0027d say, well, what about some sort of mystical or some other culture? Are you involved in-- No. I was just sort of no, no, no to all her questions. And I think she didn\u0027t know exactly what to make of that because I don\u0027t think almost anybody had ever said, no, no, no to all her questions.","I don\u0027t want you to leave, [? Zuli. ?] But this is not about you, so just keep your ego in check.","All right, I will.","I just kind of want him to take care of me. And I think he really has sort of, in a lot of ways, or he is learning to kind of just put his ego aside and do it, just kind of take care of me. I think it\u0027s really hard for him.","January 16. My five days of chemo are over.","You hear that beep? Tee. Tee, tee. Tee, tee. Well, anyway, that--","Can I have my nurse, please?","That is the last bag of my last day of the last chemo in this hospital and hopefully ever.","[HUMMING]","I feel nauseous. My stomach hurts. I don\u0027t feel like I want to do this. I feel too rotten.","It\u0027s all very anticlimactic. Kathy brings my stem cells up from the deep freeze in a Playmate cooler like she\u0027s ready for a beer at the beach.","She thaws out the bags of stem cells like you would a frozen chicken breast and infuses them back into my body through the catheter.","I\u0027m groggy and half asleep for most of it. When I come to, I hear Clinton.","That night I feel a little better.","I\u0027m feeling well enough to try some Sugar Smacks.","[SINGING] Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks. Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks. I could take them home for tea.","So remember, all you cancer patients, when you\u0027re feeling awful, try Sugar Smacks. Mmm. It\u0027s my food of choice.","Well, it\u0027s January 21. It\u0027s day one, ie I had my transplant yesterday. Is that right? Isn\u0027t it day two by now? Gosh, they\u0027re going slow. But I feel pretty crappy. I feel very nauseous. And my stomach is just very churny. Today I ate what I was sure I could stomach, a piece of rye bread and some ginger ale, and I even threw that up. But I would like to say it was almost pleasant throwing up ginger ale. It\u0027s a lot better than throwing up some other things I could name, like orange juice. Blech.","Dawn is a couple years older than me and has a 10-year-old. Looking at her is like looking in a mirror.","Right, right. Yeah.","I feel that way about the whole fight, that I probably wouldn\u0027t fight half as hard except for Griffin. Well, what choice do you have, really?","I think if my life maybe was different, maybe if there wasn\u0027t Tom and Griffin, maybe I would say, I\u0027ve lived and I\u0027ve done things, and I just don\u0027t want to fight this anymore. I\u0027m tired of it. You know, if you have to keep going through it and going through it. But you can\u0027t do that when you have a kid. Or I don\u0027t feel like I can do that with a kid. I feel like I have to keep fighting, even though it\u0027s a pain in the butt.","No, I just feel a little shaky. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s real or just fear.","Well, it\u0027s day three. And I\u0027m here because last night at about 11 o\u0027clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I\u0027d just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump.","So I just kind of got out of bed and started to come in. And I sat down on a chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over because the next thing I knew I was on the floor.","And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120.","So they don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t know. They\u0027re not even going to treat it, really. I think I\u0027d feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you\u0027ll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don\u0027t. We\u0027re no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything\u0027s OK. They think it\u0027s behind us, and we\u0027re not really going to treat it. But I don\u0027t know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary.","Four days after the transplant, and I\u0027m about to go home to our apartment. I\u0027m busy worrying about Tom having to give me antibiotic injections at home, except I don\u0027t have to worry about that because they tell me I have something called RSV.","For like a week?","The treatment requires I stay in the hospital isolation room for a week. And for 18 hours a day, I have to wear this ridiculous-looking and very uncomfortable mask strapped to my face so I can breathe in an aerosol medicine. Here\u0027s something that people forget. It\u0027s not just physically grueling being sick. It\u0027s boring.","It feels tight around my nose. And it feels sort of stuffy. And it just feels like it\u0027s hard to sleep in because it\u0027s big, and I feel kind of like an elephant or something with this big nose. I can\u0027t eat with it on or do anything. I just feel like I have to stay very still. Watching TV is good.","That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn\u0027t even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we\u0027re not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. But that anger kept me from being worried or scared, because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would get something similar to pneumonia or I wouldn\u0027t be able to breathe.","[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]","It was a disconnect for me. I just didn\u0027t make the connection that there were all these other people on respirators, and I could easily be one of them in a matter of days. I didn\u0027t think it was going to happen.","Finally a piece of good news. Dr. Armitage, the head of the Omaha transplant program, drops by my room to tell me that the stem cells they transplanted into me are growing new cells.","It was really nice and reassuring to have him say that because we had had a sort of a small setback, where I had had more chemo, and when we looked at the tests, that chemo hadn\u0027t done anything to shrink the tumor. And so you worry that the bone marrow transplant isn\u0027t even going to work. And he said, really without any information, I\u0027m very pleased with how everything went, with this undertone of, you\u0027ve probably made it. It\u0027s probably worked. You\u0027re probably OK. I don\u0027t know how he would have known that, or maybe he was bluffing. But it was real reassuring to have him come and say those things.","Day 11. They\u0027ve just let me out of the hospital, and all of a sudden, it\u0027s over. Just as sure as I was locked away, they\u0027re going to let me go.","Yeah.","Thank you.","It was weird to me when they said, OK, you can go home. And congratulations. Yay! And everybody clapped and kissed and hugged.","Yeah. Thanks for helping.","I was like, wait a second. I haven\u0027t won anything here. We don\u0027t know whether this worked. We know I got through this, but that\u0027s little consolation. The really big prize here, the car, the trip to Hawaii, is did the cancer go away? And we didn\u0027t know, and we weren\u0027t going to know for months. And so it was all very weird, everybody congratulating you and patting you on the back and saying good for you and hey, it\u0027s all over now. It seemed very strange to me.","For the first couple weeks I was in Omaha, I felt like I was on an assembly line. You come in through a revolving door. You get on the line. You get your catheter. You get your stem cells removed. You get your high dose chemo. You get your stem cells back. So now I was leaving, walking fast, head up. Suddenly I was the veteran, the old pro. And there was a scared old man with his family who had just arrived for his transplant, looking shaky and small as he sat huddled by the door.","You don\u0027t feel too good, but, you know, at least it goes by pretty-- what\u0027s good is the white cells come back pretty fast, so just a matter of about 10 days there where you\u0027re really vulnerable.","How\u0027s Graham doing?","No. Don\u0027t worry. Forget it. Lorraine.","That\u0027s pretty scary. That\u0027s pretty scary. It\u0027s early for that still. It\u0027s early, though, for that.","I have a weird sense of this whole thing with Graham because, I mean, well, now it looks bad for Graham. But for a while there I was thinking he could pull through and make it and the bone marrow transplant wouldn\u0027t really work for me. And I could be down, and he could be up. And I mean, nothing\u0027s guaranteed here at all.","Bye, Lorraine. We\u0027ll call you. Yeah. We\u0027ll call you.","Take care. Give Graham a kiss for us. Can you get in there to kiss him? OK.

He\u0027s not in the room anymore.","This morning. Did they just take him off the respirator? They didn\u0027t. He just-- he wasn\u0027t breathing. Oh. Oh, gosh.","So weird. I mean, this isn\u0027t what you expect, you know? I mean, it\u0027s rare that people die from the bone marrow transplant, but I guess it happens. But it\u0027s rare when you get your own cells. I don\u0027t know. I just feel sorry for Lorraine. Because she\u0027s got two little kids. One is just one year old, and one is eight years old. That\u0027s a lot.

Dr. Vose tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly.","It\u0027s definitely not smaller?","Oh, OK. Well, that\u0027s good. Yeah, thank you.","I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it\u0027s possible that what we\u0027re seeing, the reason it\u0027s somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there\u0027s scar tissue. So hopefully that\u0027s what it is and we\u0027re OK. And so that\u0027s nice. It\u0027s good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air. We need that music. [SINGING] You might just make it after all.","Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me.

We\u0027re going on a trip. You\u0027re going to stay with Grandpa and Grandma, with Pop-Pop and Grandma, OK?","People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. There are the ones who get their chemo and get out, and there are the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter, a lot of patients have gotten influenza. They\u0027re on respirators, and they\u0027re taking a long time to recover. There is a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean, cozy apartment we have rented. I sit on the rose-covered couch and watch the sparrows out the window. It\u0027s very cold.","We\u0027re even out at a restaurant. Not just any restaurant, but a find of a restaurant, this Catfish Lodge here in Omaha, with the white albino catfish in the tank in the middle. I\u0027m actually feeling good tonight.

I kind of like the blue one, because it\u0027s just so startling. It looks like blue food coloring kind of color or like blueberry frozen popsicle melted.","But I really do want Zofran, because I know that works for me.","Yeah.","One coping mechanism I did have was to act like a health reporter. I was obsessed with the numbers. It was really important for me to know the odds that the transplant would work. Those odds were about 50-50. So sometimes, sitting in a room with other patients, I couldn\u0027t help but think that only about half of us were going to make it. And this made it kind of hard to get close to people. But Graham and his family was an exception.","I just had a CT scan. They\u0027re looking to compare the tumor in the chest to how it was in October, see if it\u0027s shrunk.","\"Once there were three baby owls, Sarah, Percy, and Bill. They lived in a hole in the trunk of a tree with their mother owl. The hole had twigs and leaves and owl feathers in it. It was their house.

Well, what choice do you have, really?","OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches.","January 16. My five days of chemo are over.","It\u0027s all very anticlimactic.

Lorraine.","[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]","That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn\u0027t even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we\u0027re not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. But that anger kept me from being worried or scared, because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would get something similar to pneumonia or I wouldn\u0027t be able to breathe.","I\u0027m feeling pretty rotten from the ill effects of my final round of chemotherapy back in Washington. They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn\u0027t in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this, my bladder hurts and I\u0027m tired. And I\u0027m about to embark on a nasty, exhausting journey. I feel as if I need more strength, but here we go.","Day 11.

They\u0027re not even going to treat it, really. I think I\u0027d feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you\u0027ll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don\u0027t. We\u0027re no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything\u0027s OK. They think it\u0027s behind us, and we\u0027re not really going to treat it. But I don\u0027t know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary.","Dawn is a couple years older than me and has a 10-year-old. Looking at her is like looking in a mirror.","You\u0027re going to go to the park with [? Marta. ?]","Finally a piece of good news.

Oh, boy.","Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison.","I think of it kind of like a pregnancy, like having a child, like the birth. I mean, no one can tell you what it\u0027s going to be like. You kind of know it\u0027s going to be awful, or that\u0027s what a lot of people say. But nobody can really tell you what it\u0027s really going to be like, and everyone\u0027s experience is really different. And it\u0027s just sort of like, you don\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027re just going to do it. It\u0027s just going to happen. And I just sort of feel like with this it\u0027s the same thing.

It\u0027s my food of choice.","For like a week?","I don\u0027t know. In a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself from him, because I know I have to go through this and do this. And it\u0027s sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real. So a lot of times I don\u0027t have the energy for him, and that makes it easier to kind of separate from him.","This morning. Did they just take him off the respirator? They didn\u0027t. He just-- he wasn\u0027t breathing. Oh. Oh, gosh.","Well, it\u0027s January 21. It\u0027s day one, ie I had my transplant yesterday. Is that right? Isn\u0027t it day two by now? Gosh, they\u0027re going slow. But I feel pretty crappy. I feel very nauseous. And my stomach is just very churny. Today I ate what I was sure I could stomach, a piece of rye bread and some ginger ale, and I even threw that up. But I would like to say it was almost pleasant throwing up ginger ale. It\u0027s a lot better than throwing up some other things I could name, like orange juice. Blech.","No, I just feel a little shaky. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s real or just fear.","Hi, is this the seventh floor bone marrow transplant unit? I was trying to reach Lorraine Brazier. I\u0027m a friend of hers, and I was on the unit myself. Rebecca Perl. And I was just trying to find out about Graham. He\u0027s not in the room anymore.","Everybody have fun tonight. Everybody--","Bye, Lorraine. We\u0027ll call you. Yeah. We\u0027ll call you.","It was really nice and reassuring to have him say that because we had had a sort of a small setback, where I had had more chemo, and when we looked at the tests, that chemo hadn\u0027t done anything to shrink the tumor. And so you worry that the bone marrow transplant isn\u0027t even going to work. And he said, really without any information, I\u0027m very pleased with how everything went, with this undertone of, you\u0027ve probably made it. It\u0027s probably worked. You\u0027re probably OK. I don\u0027t know how he would have known that, or maybe he was bluffing. But it was real reassuring to have him come and say those things.","The news is good. Dr. Vose tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly.","That\u0027s Griffin.","[SINGING] Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks. Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks. I could take them home for tea.","Everybody have fun tonight.","Don\u0027t be doing the top.","I\u0027m groggy and half asleep for most of it. When I come to, I hear Clinton.","And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120.","The good news is I\u0027m actually feeling much better. So that night, we celebrate.","He really likes the owl book, and it makes him feel better that in the owl book, the mommy owl goes away but then she comes back. So I think he understands that. And lots of mothers go away on trips and go off for work for weeks at a time. And I\u0027ve had to do that. Now the really bad one is I\u0027m going to have to go away for a month or more. And he\u0027ll hopefully come visit. But still, it\u0027s going to be a really long time. I mean, it happens. And I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that he can have a mother.","Can I have my nurse, please?","And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that\u0027s it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I\u0027d do it at like 7:25, right before Seinfeld. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I\u0027d miss Seinfeld. So I\u0027d hurry myself along. Now I\u0027m doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House. So I give myself a treat afterwards.","I mean, it\u0027s discouraging that the tumor hasn\u0027t shrunk any. I was hoping it would shrink with these last bunch of chemos. I\u0027m just anxious to get done. And I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s really going to work. And I\u0027m kind of wondering about what\u0027s the chances it\u0027s really going to work. They can\u0027t be as good as they would be if the tumor had shrunk a lot.","Well, it\u0027s day three. And I\u0027m here because last night at about 11 o\u0027clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I\u0027d just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump.","I\u0027m just tired of being poked and prodded and pricked and achy and tired. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can\u0027t imagine it being any worse.","I feel nauseous. My stomach hurts. I don\u0027t feel like I want to do this. I feel too rotten.","I\u0027d like to have Zofran because that\u0027s worked for me in the past.","That night I feel a little better.","Twice, rabbis came into my room and left their business card, and told me if I ever wanted to talk. And it was very awkward because they were there to sort of try to, solicit important things out of me about how I was feeling. And I just didn\u0027t want to have any part of it. They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I\u0027d say, no. And then she would say, well, I don\u0027t mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I\u0027d say, no. And she\u0027d say, well, what about some sort of mystical or some other culture? Are you involved in-- No. I was just sort of no, no, no to all her questions. And I think she didn\u0027t know exactly what to make of that because I don\u0027t think almost anybody had ever said, no, no, no to all her questions.","As we wait, I\u0027m thinking about what\u0027s going to happen. Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It\u0027s the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha.","It was weird to me when they said, OK, you can go home. And congratulations. Yay! And everybody clapped and kissed and hugged.","It was a disconnect for me. I just didn\u0027t make the connection that there were all these other people on respirators, and I could easily be one of them in a matter of days. I didn\u0027t think it was going to happen.","I\u0027m a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren\u0027t used to pushy New Yorkers in Omaha.","His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their 9-month-old redheaded son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn\u0027t there. He was older than Thomas. He was nearly a year and a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much. And I didn\u0027t want him to have to understand anything.","I just kind of want him to take care of me. And I think he really has sort of, in a lot of ways, or he is learning to kind of just put his ego aside and do it, just kind of take care of me. I think it\u0027s really hard for him.","Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who\u0027s the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don\u0027t go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I\u0027m really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn\u0027t matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven\u0027t changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven\u0027t changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won\u0027t.","And I\u0027m going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It\u0027s just like being a heroine addict.","OK.","You hear that beep? Tee. Tee, tee. Tee, tee. Well, anyway, that--","Right, right. Yeah.","There are at least three reasons why I was supposed to be exempt from getting seriously sick. First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he\u0027s supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don\u0027t think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I\u0027m a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they\u0027re affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people.","Hi, I\u0027m supposed to be admitted.","You don\u0027t feel too good, but, you know, at least it goes by pretty-- what\u0027s good is the white cells come back pretty fast, so just a matter of about 10 days there where you\u0027re really vulnerable.","I think if my life maybe was different, maybe if there wasn\u0027t Tom and Griffin, maybe I would say, I\u0027ve lived and I\u0027ve done things, and I just don\u0027t want to fight this anymore. I\u0027m tired of it. You know, if you have to keep going through it and going through it. But you can\u0027t do that when you have a kid. Or I don\u0027t feel like I can do that with a kid. I feel like I have to keep fighting, even though it\u0027s a pain in the butt.","I kind of like to be a little bit removed from how everybody else is doing.","Sometimes I worry that Griffin\u0027s going to fall in love with some woman who just lays in bed all the time because that\u0027s what he sees his mother doing in the first two years of his life. I mean, he\u0027s going to fall in love with some woman who lies in bed and eats bonbons or something, or reads or something, because that seems to be what I\u0027m turning into is this person who lies in bed all the time. Or else I lie on the couch and read him books or something.","Because it\u0027s scary. It\u0027s hard for me to hear every detail of how everyone else is doing because all that could be happening to me.","I was like, wait a second. I haven\u0027t won anything here. We don\u0027t know whether this worked. We know I got through this, but that\u0027s little consolation. The really big prize here, the car, the trip to Hawaii, is did the cancer go away? And we didn\u0027t know, and we weren\u0027t going to know for months. And so it was all very weird, everybody congratulating you and patting you on the back and saying good for you and hey, it\u0027s all over now. It seemed very strange to me.","It feels tight around my nose. And it feels sort of stuffy. And it just feels like it\u0027s hard to sleep in because it\u0027s big, and I feel kind of like an elephant or something with this big nose. I can\u0027t eat with it on or do anything. I just feel like I have to stay very still. Watching TV is good.","I\u0027m feeling well enough to try some Sugar Smacks.","It didn\u0027t help to see the transplant patients who were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going, and they looked so weak shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well.","Mm-hmm.","The treatment requires I stay in the hospital isolation room for a week. And for 18 hours a day, I have to wear this ridiculous-looking and very uncomfortable mask strapped to my face so I can breathe in an aerosol medicine. Here\u0027s something that people forget. It\u0027s not just physically grueling being sick. It\u0027s boring.","And they\u0027re off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?","[HUMMING]","Griffy, you\u0027ve gotten so big. I\u0027m sorry I had to be away for so long. I was away, but I\u0027m back now. Are you my Griffy? Are you my Griffy?"]},"Joe Bradley":{"name":"Joe Bradley","episodes":{"103":"Scenes from A Transplant"},"statements":["Would you like a cup of coffee?","About 1:30.","Why? What\u0027s your hurry?

I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at The Waffle House.","For me, it was the worst part, having to give myself shots. For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through.","December 1. After three days on the road, we make it to Omaha.","The first week in Omaha felt like boot camp. I shuffled from one test to another.","And I didn\u0027t like Kathy\u0027s cheerleading.","So I settled for the occasional phone call.","The American Cancer Society offers classes in how you can look better and feel better. And though it sounded hokey at the time, now I understand why they do this. Getting sick really played havoc with my body image. I felt as if my body had betrayed me like a separate person I couldn\u0027t trust. My sexual desire went out the window. I figured I wouldn\u0027t mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn\u0027t hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was like looking at a Holocaust victim, all skin and bones. Actually, I\u0027ve always been tiny and scrawny, but I never minded before. So I avoided mirrors and wore a hat even when the weather got warm. I did break down and let Tom style the little bit of fuzz that was still left on my head.","My room looks like you could wash it down with a hose, like a vet\u0027s examining room. It\u0027s an awful mustardy yellow. It overlooks a graveyard. I\u0027m here for five days while they pour deadly medicines into my veins.","In the hospital, there\u0027s the official information that the staff doles out, and there\u0027s the unofficial grapevine, tips and advice that patients share with each other. From the veteran patients, I hear that the University of Nebraska Medical Center doesn\u0027t like to give out Zofran, an anti-nausea drug that\u0027s very expensive but works like a charm when you\u0027re getting chemotherapy. So I start to insist on it to everyone I see. I tell the nurses--","--the resident--","--and the head doctor.","Despite my requests, my demands, my begging, the first night, they fail to give me Zofran, and like Graham, my jaw stiffens up, a side effect of a cheaper, less effective anti-nausea drug. It\u0027s a reminder of what it means to be a patient. You can ask, but sometimes you have very little power.","During my high dose chemo, I find out that Graham is back in the hospital on a ventilator. They think he has pneumonia and sepsis, an infection of the blood that is common in hospitals and quite serious for transplant patients. Tom and Dan keep giving me updates about Graham\u0027s condition, but I don\u0027t really want to know.","The staff really did try to help me cope, and I did appreciate how genuinely nice Midwesterners are. But sometimes I just couldn\u0027t get with the program.","What worked for me was to work. One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but as a patient, I had to be a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics. And for support, I had Tom, who I call [? Zuli, ?] and he was a huge comfort to me.","Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something, we just sort of called a truce or something, each of us did. We almost never fight now. Both of us pretty much kind of let things just slide. If I\u0027m pissed off about something, I just sort of say, oh well. He does the same, I think.","Of course we did have our moments.","January 20. It\u0027s a big day for Bill Clinton and for me too. He\u0027s being sworn in for his second term. I\u0027m getting my stem cells back. They call it day zero because the recovery starts here. Tom and Dan keep trying to get me to say something profound like, getting my stem cells back is like getting my life back. It\u0027s true without these stem cells I would die. The chemo wiped out my body\u0027s ability to make blood cells. But I\u0027m feeling too lousy to wax poetic.","But over the next few days, as the chemo destroys my immune system, I feel as rotten as I\u0027ve ever felt. This is rock bottom. And without the energy that comes from blood cells, I feel fragile, anxious, and empty.","There\u0027s some comfort in knowing that I\u0027m supposed to feel this way. The chemo can\u0027t distinguish between healthy cells and the cancer, so it wipes out everything that grows fast-- the lining of the digestive tract, the blood cells, hair follicles. One patient who has just been through it assures me it will pass.","Though my recovery was supposed to be outpatient, two days after the transplant, I\u0027m back in the hospital.","That has stayed with me in a way that nothing else has because it\u0027s like losing your innocence or something. I mean, it just seems like this weird thing. My heart isn\u0027t supposed to ever stop, and my heart has been stopped. And to me, that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It\u0027s almost like everything else is OK, but that really gets me somehow. I wish that hadn\u0027t happened.","Just down the hall, Graham has been on a respirator for more than a week. After Graham\u0027s 8-year-old old daughter, Kelli, plays her flute for him, he seems to show some slight improvement, but the doctors say he\u0027s still in critical condition.","Then we say goodbye to Lorraine.","Her husband, Graham, is still on a respirator. She tells us that she\u0027s losing hope.","I tell her to be optimistic, but I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m saying this. In my heart, I know she\u0027s right to prepare herself for Graham\u0027s death. It\u0027s not a good scene. Here I am leaving, getting out of town alive, and Lorraine\u0027s world is falling apart.

It\u0027s a big day for Bill Clinton and for me too. He\u0027s being sworn in for his second term. I\u0027m getting my stem cells back. They call it day zero because the recovery starts here. Tom and Dan keep trying to get me to say something profound like, getting my stem cells back is like getting my life back. It\u0027s true without these stem cells I would die. The chemo wiped out my body\u0027s ability to make blood cells. But I\u0027m feeling too lousy to wax poetic.","December 1. After three days on the road, we make it to Omaha.","Of course we did have our moments.","Her husband, Graham, is still on a respirator. She tells us that she\u0027s losing hope.","I tell her to be optimistic, but I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m saying this. In my heart, I know she\u0027s right to prepare herself for Graham\u0027s death. It\u0027s not a good scene. Here I am leaving, getting out of town alive, and Lorraine\u0027s world is falling apart.

For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through.","I want to believe, and I think I basically do believe that this whole ordeal did not impact Griffy in a bad way. And I think that it didn\u0027t.","So I settled for the occasional phone call.","During my high dose chemo, I find out that Graham is back in the hospital on a ventilator. They think he has pneumonia and sepsis, an infection of the blood that is common in hospitals and quite serious for transplant patients. Tom and Dan keep giving me updates about Graham\u0027s condition, but I don\u0027t really want to know.","Then we say goodbye to Lorraine.","The first week in Omaha felt like boot camp. I shuffled from one test to another.","--the resident--","What worked for me was to work. One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but as a patient, I had to be a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics. And for support, I had Tom, who I call [? Zuli, ?] and he was a huge comfort to me.","There\u0027s some comfort in knowing that I\u0027m supposed to feel this way. The chemo can\u0027t distinguish between healthy cells and the cancer, so it wipes out everything that grows fast-- the lining of the digestive tract, the blood cells, hair follicles. One patient who has just been through it assures me it will pass.","But over the next few days, as the chemo destroys my immune system, I feel as rotten as I\u0027ve ever felt. This is rock bottom. And without the energy that comes from blood cells, I feel fragile, anxious, and empty.","--and the head doctor.","February 3. I\u0027ve been home four days when I call back to Omaha to see how Graham is doing.","In the hospital, there\u0027s the official information that the staff doles out, and there\u0027s the unofficial grapevine, tips and advice that patients share with each other. From the veteran patients, I hear that the University of Nebraska Medical Center doesn\u0027t like to give out Zofran, an anti-nausea drug that\u0027s very expensive but works like a charm when you\u0027re getting chemotherapy. So I start to insist on it to everyone I see. I tell the nurses--","Springtime. The buds on the maple tree outside our bedroom window have begun to sprout, and so has my hair. I call this tree my hair tree because since I\u0027ve been having chemo, my hair has fallen out and grown back at the same time the tree has lost its leaves and sprouted new ones.","My room looks like you could wash it down with a hose, like a vet\u0027s examining room. It\u0027s an awful mustardy yellow. It overlooks a graveyard. I\u0027m here for five days while they pour deadly medicines into my veins.","Despite my requests, my demands, my begging, the first night, they fail to give me Zofran, and like Graham, my jaw stiffens up, a side effect of a cheaper, less effective anti-nausea drug. It\u0027s a reminder of what it means to be a patient. You can ask, but sometimes you have very little power.","Maybe it was a little crazy to drive all the way to Omaha in the dead of winter, but I hate to fly, and Tom likes road trips. I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at The Waffle House.","It\u0027s funny when you realize you\u0027re going to get your life back, that your job isn\u0027t just fighting a disease anymore.

I mean, it just seems like this weird thing. My heart isn\u0027t supposed to ever stop, and my heart has been stopped. And to me, that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It\u0027s almost like everything else is OK, but that really gets me somehow. I wish that hadn\u0027t happened.","One year since my transplant. The tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease is gone. I\u0027m back at work, but my energy is still low.

And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick.","Just down the hall, Graham has been on a respirator for more than a week. After Graham\u0027s 8-year-old old daughter, Kelli, plays her flute for him, he seems to show some slight improvement, but the doctors say he\u0027s still in critical condition.","The American Cancer Society offers classes in how you can look better and feel better. And though it sounded hokey at the time, now I understand why they do this. Getting sick really played havoc with my body image. I felt as if my body had betrayed me like a separate person I couldn\u0027t trust. My sexual desire went out the window. I figured I wouldn\u0027t mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn\u0027t hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was like looking at a Holocaust victim, all skin and bones. Actually, I\u0027ve always been tiny and scrawny, but I never minded before. So I avoided mirrors and wore a hat even when the weather got warm. I did break down and let Tom style the little bit of fuzz that was still left on my head.","Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something, we just sort of called a truce or something, each of us did. We almost never fight now. Both of us pretty much kind of let things just slide. If I\u0027m pissed off about something, I just sort of say, oh well.

Now the really bad one is I\u0027m going to have to go away for a month or more. And he\u0027ll hopefully come visit. But still, it\u0027s going to be a really long time. I mean, it happens. And I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that he can have a mother.","OK.","Bye bye, Griffy. We\u0027ll see you soon, OK? Bye bye. You stay with Grandpa and Mama, OK? Say bye bye.","OK, OK. You go to Pop-Pop. Want to go to Pop-Pop?","You\u0027re going to go to the park with [? Marta. ?]","Bye, Griffy. You\u0027ll be OK. Bye-bye.","There are at least three reasons why I was supposed to be exempt from getting seriously sick. First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he\u0027s supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don\u0027t think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I\u0027m a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they\u0027re affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people.","And they\u0027re off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?","OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches.","We\u0027re in the bathroom of The Waffle House. Did you lock the door?","And I\u0027m going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It\u0027s just like being a heroine addict.","And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that\u0027s it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I\u0027d do it at like 7:25, right before Seinfeld. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I\u0027d miss Seinfeld. So I\u0027d hurry myself along. Now I\u0027m doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House. So I give myself a treat afterwards.","Mmm! Waffle House. Chicken melt. Oh, boy.","I\u0027m feeling pretty rotten from the ill effects of my final round of chemotherapy back in Washington. They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn\u0027t in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this, my bladder hurts and I\u0027m tired. And I\u0027m about to embark on a nasty, exhausting journey. I feel as if I need more strength, but here we go.","OK.","Endless poking and prodding.","I\u0027m just tired of being poked and prodded and pricked and achy and tired. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can\u0027t imagine it being any worse.","Kathy Byar was my nurse coordinator. She seemed more interested in keeping me on schedule than in what I was going through. We called her my drill sergeant.","I\u0027m a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren\u0027t used to pushy New Yorkers in Omaha.","You\u0027ve got to get me on a later schedule. I\u0027m too exhausted.","I just wasn\u0027t in the mood, you know? I\u0027d been through a lot already. And I was tired. I remember she would say, positive attitude, positive attitude. And I just felt like hell, you know? I had a positive attitude the first time around, and it didn\u0027t work. I mean, now I was going through something even worse. And it was hard for me to keep positive.","One coping mechanism I did have was to act like a health reporter. I was obsessed with the numbers. It was really important for me to know the odds that the transplant would work. Those odds were about 50-50. So sometimes, sitting in a room with other patients, I couldn\u0027t help but think that only about half of us were going to make it. And this made it kind of hard to get close to people. But Graham and his family was an exception.","Graham was a young father facing worse odds than me.","His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their 9-month-old redheaded son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn\u0027t there. He was older than Thomas. He was nearly a year and a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much. And I didn\u0027t want him to have to understand anything.","Hi, Griffy! Hi, Griffy!","Hey, Griffy, want me to sing \"Macaroni\"? I have a little pony. His name is Macaroni. He trots and trots and then he stops. My funny little pony, Macaroni. Do you like that song, Griffy?","I don\u0027t know. In a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself from him, because I know I have to go through this and do this. And it\u0027s sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real. So a lot of times I don\u0027t have the energy for him, and that makes it easier to kind of separate from him.","Griffy, I miss you. I\u0027ll see you soon. I love you. I love you, Griffy.","December 10. We get some bad news. The CAT scan shows the most recent round of chemotherapy back in Washington hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor nearly at all. Julie Vose is my doctor in Omaha.","The good news is I\u0027m actually feeling much better. So that night, we celebrate.","We\u0027re even out at a restaurant. Not just any restaurant, but a find of a restaurant, this Catfish Lodge here in Omaha, with the white albino catfish in the tank in the middle. I\u0027m actually feeling good tonight. It\u0027s like a miracle. I haven\u0027t felt like this. I\u0027m not, like, crying or in pain or something.","Two days later, I begin the Omaha chemo.","They give you four drugs, and one of them is blue. I kind of like the blue one, because it\u0027s just so startling. It looks like blue food coloring kind of color or like blueberry frozen popsicle melted.","Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison.","Don\u0027t be doing the top.","Those are famous last words.","I just had a CT scan. They\u0027re looking to compare the tumor in the chest to how it was in October, see if it\u0027s shrunk.","The blue chemo hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor either. So finally it\u0027s time to get on with the bone marrow transplant.","I mean, it\u0027s discouraging that the tumor hasn\u0027t shrunk any. I was hoping it would shrink with these last bunch of chemos. I\u0027m just anxious to get done. And I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s really going to work. And I\u0027m kind of wondering about what\u0027s the chances it\u0027s really going to work. They can\u0027t be as good as they would be if the tumor had shrunk a lot.","Mm-hmm.","The consent form is a reminder of what I\u0027m in for. It lists all sorts of nasty things that could and sometimes do happen when you have a bone marrow transplant-- kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure.","It didn\u0027t help to see the transplant patients who were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going, and they looked so weak shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well.","People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. There are the ones who get their chemo and get out, and there are the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter, a lot of patients have gotten influenza. They\u0027re on respirators, and they\u0027re taking a long time to recover. There is a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean, cozy apartment we have rented. I sit on the rose-covered couch and watch the sparrows out the window. It\u0027s very cold.","As we wait, I\u0027m thinking about what\u0027s going to happen. Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It\u0027s the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha.","Hi, I\u0027m supposed to be admitted.","Rebecca Perl.","I think of it kind of like a pregnancy, like having a child, like the birth. I mean, no one can tell you what it\u0027s going to be like. You kind of know it\u0027s going to be awful, or that\u0027s what a lot of people say. But nobody can really tell you what it\u0027s really going to be like, and everyone\u0027s experience is really different. And it\u0027s just sort of like, you don\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027re just going to do it. It\u0027s just going to happen. And I just sort of feel like with this it\u0027s the same thing. It\u0027s like this momentum, and it\u0027s just going to happen, and I\u0027m going to do it. I mean, it\u0027s scary, but I\u0027m just going to do it.","Everybody have fun tonight. Everybody--","Everybody have fun tonight.","I\u0027d like to have Zofran because that\u0027s worked for me in the past.","But I really do want Zofran, because I know that works for me.","I just feel like I\u0027ve said this to so many people so many times. I want to get Zofran every day.","I kind of like to be a little bit removed from how everybody else is doing.","Because it\u0027s scary. It\u0027s hard for me to hear every detail of how everyone else is doing because all that could be happening to me.","Twice, rabbis came into my room and left their business card, and told me if I ever wanted to talk. And it was very awkward because they were there to sort of try to, solicit important things out of me about how I was feeling. And I just didn\u0027t want to have any part of it. They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I\u0027d say, no. And then she would say, well, I don\u0027t mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I\u0027d say, no. And she\u0027d say, well, what about some sort of mystical or some other culture? Are you involved in-- No. I was just sort of no, no, no to all her questions. And I think she didn\u0027t know exactly what to make of that because I don\u0027t think almost anybody had ever said, no, no, no to all her questions.","I don\u0027t want you to leave, [? Zuli. ?] But this is not about you, so just keep your ego in check.","All right, I will.","I just kind of want him to take care of me. And I think he really has sort of, in a lot of ways, or he is learning to kind of just put his ego aside and do it, just kind of take care of me. I think it\u0027s really hard for him.","January 16. My five days of chemo are over.","You hear that beep? Tee. Tee, tee. Tee, tee. Well, anyway, that--","Can I have my nurse, please?","That is the last bag of my last day of the last chemo in this hospital and hopefully ever.","[HUMMING]","I feel nauseous. My stomach hurts. I don\u0027t feel like I want to do this. I feel too rotten.","It\u0027s all very anticlimactic. Kathy brings my stem cells up from the deep freeze in a Playmate cooler like she\u0027s ready for a beer at the beach.","She thaws out the bags of stem cells like you would a frozen chicken breast and infuses them back into my body through the catheter.","I\u0027m groggy and half asleep for most of it. When I come to, I hear Clinton.","That night I feel a little better.","I\u0027m feeling well enough to try some Sugar Smacks.","[SINGING] Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks. Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks. I could take them home for tea.","So remember, all you cancer patients, when you\u0027re feeling awful, try Sugar Smacks. Mmm. It\u0027s my food of choice.","Well, it\u0027s January 21. It\u0027s day one, ie I had my transplant yesterday. Is that right? Isn\u0027t it day two by now? Gosh, they\u0027re going slow. But I feel pretty crappy. I feel very nauseous. And my stomach is just very churny. Today I ate what I was sure I could stomach, a piece of rye bread and some ginger ale, and I even threw that up. But I would like to say it was almost pleasant throwing up ginger ale. It\u0027s a lot better than throwing up some other things I could name, like orange juice. Blech.","Dawn is a couple years older than me and has a 10-year-old. Looking at her is like looking in a mirror.","Right, right. Yeah.","I feel that way about the whole fight, that I probably wouldn\u0027t fight half as hard except for Griffin. Well, what choice do you have, really?","I think if my life maybe was different, maybe if there wasn\u0027t Tom and Griffin, maybe I would say, I\u0027ve lived and I\u0027ve done things, and I just don\u0027t want to fight this anymore. I\u0027m tired of it. You know, if you have to keep going through it and going through it. But you can\u0027t do that when you have a kid. Or I don\u0027t feel like I can do that with a kid. I feel like I have to keep fighting, even though it\u0027s a pain in the butt.","No, I just feel a little shaky. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s real or just fear.","Well, it\u0027s day three. And I\u0027m here because last night at about 11 o\u0027clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I\u0027d just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump.","So I just kind of got out of bed and started to come in. And I sat down on a chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over because the next thing I knew I was on the floor.","And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120.","So they don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t know. They\u0027re not even going to treat it, really. I think I\u0027d feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you\u0027ll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don\u0027t. We\u0027re no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything\u0027s OK. They think it\u0027s behind us, and we\u0027re not really going to treat it. But I don\u0027t know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary.","Four days after the transplant, and I\u0027m about to go home to our apartment. I\u0027m busy worrying about Tom having to give me antibiotic injections at home, except I don\u0027t have to worry about that because they tell me I have something called RSV.","For like a week?","The treatment requires I stay in the hospital isolation room for a week. And for 18 hours a day, I have to wear this ridiculous-looking and very uncomfortable mask strapped to my face so I can breathe in an aerosol medicine. Here\u0027s something that people forget. It\u0027s not just physically grueling being sick. It\u0027s boring.","It feels tight around my nose. And it feels sort of stuffy. And it just feels like it\u0027s hard to sleep in because it\u0027s big, and I feel kind of like an elephant or something with this big nose. I can\u0027t eat with it on or do anything. I just feel like I have to stay very still. Watching TV is good.","That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn\u0027t even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we\u0027re not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. But that anger kept me from being worried or scared, because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would get something similar to pneumonia or I wouldn\u0027t be able to breathe.","[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]","It was a disconnect for me. I just didn\u0027t make the connection that there were all these other people on respirators, and I could easily be one of them in a matter of days. I didn\u0027t think it was going to happen.","Finally a piece of good news. Dr. Armitage, the head of the Omaha transplant program, drops by my room to tell me that the stem cells they transplanted into me are growing new cells.","It was really nice and reassuring to have him say that because we had had a sort of a small setback, where I had had more chemo, and when we looked at the tests, that chemo hadn\u0027t done anything to shrink the tumor. And so you worry that the bone marrow transplant isn\u0027t even going to work. And he said, really without any information, I\u0027m very pleased with how everything went, with this undertone of, you\u0027ve probably made it. It\u0027s probably worked. You\u0027re probably OK. I don\u0027t know how he would have known that, or maybe he was bluffing. But it was real reassuring to have him come and say those things.","Day 11. They\u0027ve just let me out of the hospital, and all of a sudden, it\u0027s over. Just as sure as I was locked away, they\u0027re going to let me go.","Yeah.","Thank you.","It was weird to me when they said, OK, you can go home. And congratulations. Yay! And everybody clapped and kissed and hugged.","Yeah. Thanks for helping.","I was like, wait a second. I haven\u0027t won anything here. We don\u0027t know whether this worked. We know I got through this, but that\u0027s little consolation. The really big prize here, the car, the trip to Hawaii, is did the cancer go away? And we didn\u0027t know, and we weren\u0027t going to know for months. And so it was all very weird, everybody congratulating you and patting you on the back and saying good for you and hey, it\u0027s all over now. It seemed very strange to me.","For the first couple weeks I was in Omaha, I felt like I was on an assembly line. You come in through a revolving door. You get on the line. You get your catheter. You get your stem cells removed. You get your high dose chemo. You get your stem cells back. So now I was leaving, walking fast, head up. Suddenly I was the veteran, the old pro. And there was a scared old man with his family who had just arrived for his transplant, looking shaky and small as he sat huddled by the door.","You don\u0027t feel too good, but, you know, at least it goes by pretty-- what\u0027s good is the white cells come back pretty fast, so just a matter of about 10 days there where you\u0027re really vulnerable.","How\u0027s Graham doing?","No. Don\u0027t worry. Forget it. Lorraine.","That\u0027s pretty scary. That\u0027s pretty scary. It\u0027s early for that still. It\u0027s early, though, for that.","I have a weird sense of this whole thing with Graham because, I mean, well, now it looks bad for Graham. But for a while there I was thinking he could pull through and make it and the bone marrow transplant wouldn\u0027t really work for me. And I could be down, and he could be up. And I mean, nothing\u0027s guaranteed here at all.","Bye, Lorraine. We\u0027ll call you. Yeah. We\u0027ll call you.","Take care. Give Graham a kiss for us. Can you get in there to kiss him? OK. Then do. Bye. Bye, Thomas. Bye, Thomas! Say hi to Kelli.","Griffy, you\u0027ve gotten so big. I\u0027m sorry I had to be away for so long. I was away, but I\u0027m back now. Are you my Griffy? Are you my Griffy?","Mommy came back. \"\u0027Mommy,\u0027 they cried. They flapped and they danced and they bounced up and down on their branches. \u0027What\u0027s all the fuss,\u0027 their mother owl said. \u0027You knew I\u0027d come back.\u0027 And the baby owls thought-- because all owls think a lot. \u0027I knew it,\u0027 said Sarah. \u0027And I knew it,\u0027 said Percy. \u0027I love my mommy,\u0027 said Bill.\"","Griffy.","Mommy.","Griffy.","Mommy.","Griffy.","Mommy.","Mommy.","Hi, is this the seventh floor bone marrow transplant unit? I was trying to reach Lorraine Brazier. I\u0027m a friend of hers, and I was on the unit myself. Rebecca Perl. And I was just trying to find out about Graham. He\u0027s not in the room anymore.","This morning. Did they just take him off the respirator? They didn\u0027t. He just-- he wasn\u0027t breathing. Oh. Oh, gosh.","So weird. I mean, this isn\u0027t what you expect, you know? I mean, it\u0027s rare that people die from the bone marrow transplant, but I guess it happens. But it\u0027s rare when you get your own cells. I don\u0027t know. I just feel sorry for Lorraine. Because she\u0027s got two little kids. One is just one year old, and one is eight years old. That\u0027s a lot. And it\u0027s just a lot that they won\u0027t have a father.","April 15. Three months have gone by, and we\u0027re back in Omaha. It\u0027s tax day and the day I find out if my transplant worked. This time we\u0027re only here for two days, and Griffin is with us.","That\u0027s Griffin.","The news is good. Dr. Vose tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly.","It\u0027s definitely not smaller?","Oh, OK. Well, that\u0027s good. Yeah, thank you.","I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it\u0027s possible that what we\u0027re seeing, the reason it\u0027s somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there\u0027s scar tissue. So hopefully that\u0027s what it is and we\u0027re OK. And so that\u0027s nice. It\u0027s good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air. We need that music. [SINGING] You might just make it after all.","Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who\u0027s the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don\u0027t go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I\u0027m really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn\u0027t matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven\u0027t changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven\u0027t changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won\u0027t."],"spokenWords":["Bye bye, Griffy. We\u0027ll see you soon, OK? Bye bye. You stay with Grandpa and Mama, OK?

One night they woke up and their mother owl was gone. \u0027Where\u0027s Mommy?\u0027 said Sarah. \u0027Oh, my goodness,\u0027 said Percy. \u0027I want my mommy,\u0027 said Bill.\"","Thank you.","Those are famous last words.","December 10. We get some bad news. The CAT scan shows the most recent round of chemotherapy back in Washington hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor nearly at all. Julie Vose is my doctor in Omaha.","I feel that way about the whole fight, that I probably wouldn\u0027t fight half as hard except for Griffin. Well, what choice do you have, really?","OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches.","January 16. My five days of chemo are over.","It\u0027s all very anticlimactic. Kathy brings my stem cells up from the deep freeze in a Playmate cooler like she\u0027s ready for a beer at the beach.","How\u0027s Graham doing?","We\u0027re in the bathroom of The Waffle House. Did you lock the door?","I have a weird sense of this whole thing with Graham because, I mean, well, now it looks bad for Graham. But for a while there I was thinking he could pull through and make it and the bone marrow transplant wouldn\u0027t really work for me. And I could be down, and he could be up. And I mean, nothing\u0027s guaranteed here at all.","That is the last bag of my last day of the last chemo in this hospital and hopefully ever.","She thaws out the bags of stem cells like you would a frozen chicken breast and infuses them back into my body through the catheter.","Hey, Griffy, want me to sing \"Macaroni\"? I have a little pony. His name is Macaroni. He trots and trots and then he stops. My funny little pony, Macaroni. Do you like that song, Griffy?","All right, I will.","Bye, Griffy. You\u0027ll be OK. Bye-bye.","The consent form is a reminder of what I\u0027m in for. It lists all sorts of nasty things that could and sometimes do happen when you have a bone marrow transplant-- kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure.","For the first couple weeks I was in Omaha, I felt like I was on an assembly line. You come in through a revolving door. You get on the line. You get your catheter. You get your stem cells removed. You get your high dose chemo. You get your stem cells back. So now I was leaving, walking fast, head up. Suddenly I was the veteran, the old pro. And there was a scared old man with his family who had just arrived for his transplant, looking shaky and small as he sat huddled by the door.","No. Don\u0027t worry. Forget it. Lorraine.","[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]","That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn\u0027t even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we\u0027re not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. But that anger kept me from being worried or scared, because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would get something similar to pneumonia or I wouldn\u0027t be able to breathe.","I\u0027m feeling pretty rotten from the ill effects of my final round of chemotherapy back in Washington. They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn\u0027t in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this, my bladder hurts and I\u0027m tired. And I\u0027m about to embark on a nasty, exhausting journey. I feel as if I need more strength, but here we go.","Day 11. They\u0027ve just let me out of the hospital, and all of a sudden, it\u0027s over. Just as sure as I was locked away, they\u0027re going to let me go.","Endless poking and prodding.","That\u0027s pretty scary. That\u0027s pretty scary. It\u0027s early for that still. It\u0027s early, though, for that.","Yeah. Thanks for helping.","Hi, Griffy! Hi, Griffy!","So I just kind of got out of bed and started to come in. And I sat down on a chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over because the next thing I knew I was on the floor.","So they don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t know. They\u0027re not even going to treat it, really. I think I\u0027d feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you\u0027ll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don\u0027t. We\u0027re no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything\u0027s OK. They think it\u0027s behind us, and we\u0027re not really going to treat it. But I don\u0027t know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary.","Dawn is a couple years older than me and has a 10-year-old. Looking at her is like looking in a mirror.","You\u0027re going to go to the park with [? Marta. ?]","Finally a piece of good news. Dr. Armitage, the head of the Omaha transplant program, drops by my room to tell me that the stem cells they transplanted into me are growing new cells.","So weird. I mean, this isn\u0027t what you expect, you know? I mean, it\u0027s rare that people die from the bone marrow transplant, but I guess it happens. But it\u0027s rare when you get your own cells. I don\u0027t know. I just feel sorry for Lorraine. Because she\u0027s got two little kids. One is just one year old, and one is eight years old. That\u0027s a lot. And it\u0027s just a lot that they won\u0027t have a father.","I just wasn\u0027t in the mood, you know? I\u0027d been through a lot already. And I was tired. I remember she would say, positive attitude, positive attitude. And I just felt like hell, you know? I had a positive attitude the first time around, and it didn\u0027t work. I mean, now I was going through something even worse. And it was hard for me to keep positive.","I don\u0027t want you to leave, [? Zuli. ?] But this is not about you, so just keep your ego in check.","Griffy, I miss you. I\u0027ll see you soon. I love you. I love you, Griffy.","April 15. Three months have gone by, and we\u0027re back in Omaha. It\u0027s tax day and the day I find out if my transplant worked. This time we\u0027re only here for two days, and Griffin is with us.","I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it\u0027s possible that what we\u0027re seeing, the reason it\u0027s somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there\u0027s scar tissue. So hopefully that\u0027s what it is and we\u0027re OK. And so that\u0027s nice. It\u0027s good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air. We need that music. [SINGING] You might just make it after all.","Oh, OK. Well, that\u0027s good. Yeah, thank you.","OK, OK. You go to Pop-Pop. Want to go to Pop-Pop?","Graham was a young father facing worse odds than me.","You\u0027ve got to get me on a later schedule. I\u0027m too exhausted.","The blue chemo hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor either. So finally it\u0027s time to get on with the bone marrow transplant.","Kathy Byar was my nurse coordinator. She seemed more interested in keeping me on schedule than in what I was going through. We called her my drill sergeant.","Four days after the transplant, and I\u0027m about to go home to our apartment. I\u0027m busy worrying about Tom having to give me antibiotic injections at home, except I don\u0027t have to worry about that because they tell me I have something called RSV.","Take care. Give Graham a kiss for us. Can you get in there to kiss him? OK. Then do. Bye. Bye, Thomas. Bye, Thomas! Say hi to Kelli.","Mommy.","Rebecca Perl.","Mmm! Waffle House. Chicken melt. Oh, boy.","Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison.","I think of it kind of like a pregnancy, like having a child, like the birth. I mean, no one can tell you what it\u0027s going to be like. You kind of know it\u0027s going to be awful, or that\u0027s what a lot of people say. But nobody can really tell you what it\u0027s really going to be like, and everyone\u0027s experience is really different. And it\u0027s just sort of like, you don\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027re just going to do it. It\u0027s just going to happen. And I just sort of feel like with this it\u0027s the same thing. It\u0027s like this momentum, and it\u0027s just going to happen, and I\u0027m going to do it. I mean, it\u0027s scary, but I\u0027m just going to do it.","So remember, all you cancer patients, when you\u0027re feeling awful, try Sugar Smacks. Mmm. It\u0027s my food of choice.","For like a week?","I don\u0027t know. In a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself from him, because I know I have to go through this and do this. And it\u0027s sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real. So a lot of times I don\u0027t have the energy for him, and that makes it easier to kind of separate from him.","This morning. Did they just take him off the respirator? They didn\u0027t. He just-- he wasn\u0027t breathing. Oh. Oh, gosh.","Well, it\u0027s January 21. It\u0027s day one, ie I had my transplant yesterday. Is that right? Isn\u0027t it day two by now? Gosh, they\u0027re going slow. But I feel pretty crappy. I feel very nauseous. And my stomach is just very churny. Today I ate what I was sure I could stomach, a piece of rye bread and some ginger ale, and I even threw that up. But I would like to say it was almost pleasant throwing up ginger ale. It\u0027s a lot better than throwing up some other things I could name, like orange juice. Blech.","No, I just feel a little shaky. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s real or just fear.","Hi, is this the seventh floor bone marrow transplant unit? I was trying to reach Lorraine Brazier. I\u0027m a friend of hers, and I was on the unit myself. Rebecca Perl. And I was just trying to find out about Graham. He\u0027s not in the room anymore.","Everybody have fun tonight. Everybody--","Bye, Lorraine. We\u0027ll call you. Yeah. We\u0027ll call you.","It was really nice and reassuring to have him say that because we had had a sort of a small setback, where I had had more chemo, and when we looked at the tests, that chemo hadn\u0027t done anything to shrink the tumor. And so you worry that the bone marrow transplant isn\u0027t even going to work. And he said, really without any information, I\u0027m very pleased with how everything went, with this undertone of, you\u0027ve probably made it. It\u0027s probably worked. You\u0027re probably OK. I don\u0027t know how he would have known that, or maybe he was bluffing. But it was real reassuring to have him come and say those things.","The news is good. Dr. Vose tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly.","That\u0027s Griffin.","[SINGING] Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks, Sugar Smacks. Can\u0027t get enough of those Sugar Smacks. I could take them home for tea.","Everybody have fun tonight.","Don\u0027t be doing the top.","I\u0027m groggy and half asleep for most of it. When I come to, I hear Clinton.","And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120.","The good news is I\u0027m actually feeling much better. So that night, we celebrate.","He really likes the owl book, and it makes him feel better that in the owl book, the mommy owl goes away but then she comes back. So I think he understands that. And lots of mothers go away on trips and go off for work for weeks at a time. And I\u0027ve had to do that. Now the really bad one is I\u0027m going to have to go away for a month or more. And he\u0027ll hopefully come visit. But still, it\u0027s going to be a really long time. I mean, it happens. And I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that he can have a mother.","Can I have my nurse, please?","And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that\u0027s it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I\u0027d do it at like 7:25, right before Seinfeld. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I\u0027d miss Seinfeld. So I\u0027d hurry myself along. Now I\u0027m doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House. So I give myself a treat afterwards.","I mean, it\u0027s discouraging that the tumor hasn\u0027t shrunk any. I was hoping it would shrink with these last bunch of chemos. I\u0027m just anxious to get done. And I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s really going to work. And I\u0027m kind of wondering about what\u0027s the chances it\u0027s really going to work. They can\u0027t be as good as they would be if the tumor had shrunk a lot.","Well, it\u0027s day three. And I\u0027m here because last night at about 11 o\u0027clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I\u0027d just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump.","I\u0027m just tired of being poked and prodded and pricked and achy and tired. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can\u0027t imagine it being any worse.","I feel nauseous. My stomach hurts. I don\u0027t feel like I want to do this. I feel too rotten.","I\u0027d like to have Zofran because that\u0027s worked for me in the past.","That night I feel a little better.","Twice, rabbis came into my room and left their business card, and told me if I ever wanted to talk. And it was very awkward because they were there to sort of try to, solicit important things out of me about how I was feeling. And I just didn\u0027t want to have any part of it. They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I\u0027d say, no. And then she would say, well, I don\u0027t mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I\u0027d say, no. And she\u0027d say, well, what about some sort of mystical or some other culture? Are you involved in-- No. I was just sort of no, no, no to all her questions. And I think she didn\u0027t know exactly what to make of that because I don\u0027t think almost anybody had ever said, no, no, no to all her questions.","As we wait, I\u0027m thinking about what\u0027s going to happen. Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It\u0027s the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha.","It was weird to me when they said, OK, you can go home. And congratulations. Yay! And everybody clapped and kissed and hugged.","It was a disconnect for me. I just didn\u0027t make the connection that there were all these other people on respirators, and I could easily be one of them in a matter of days. I didn\u0027t think it was going to happen.","I\u0027m a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren\u0027t used to pushy New Yorkers in Omaha.","His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their 9-month-old redheaded son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn\u0027t there. He was older than Thomas. He was nearly a year and a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much. And I didn\u0027t want him to have to understand anything.","I just kind of want him to take care of me. And I think he really has sort of, in a lot of ways, or he is learning to kind of just put his ego aside and do it, just kind of take care of me. I think it\u0027s really hard for him.","Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who\u0027s the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don\u0027t go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I\u0027m really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn\u0027t matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven\u0027t changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven\u0027t changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won\u0027t.","And I\u0027m going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It\u0027s just like being a heroine addict.","OK.","You hear that beep? Tee. Tee, tee. Tee, tee. Well, anyway, that--","Right, right. Yeah.","There are at least three reasons why I was supposed to be exempt from getting seriously sick. First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he\u0027s supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don\u0027t think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I\u0027m a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they\u0027re affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people.","Hi, I\u0027m supposed to be admitted.","You don\u0027t feel too good, but, you know, at least it goes by pretty-- what\u0027s good is the white cells come back pretty fast, so just a matter of about 10 days there where you\u0027re really vulnerable.","I think if my life maybe was different, maybe if there wasn\u0027t Tom and Griffin, maybe I would say, I\u0027ve lived and I\u0027ve done things, and I just don\u0027t want to fight this anymore. I\u0027m tired of it. You know, if you have to keep going through it and going through it. But you can\u0027t do that when you have a kid. Or I don\u0027t feel like I can do that with a kid. I feel like I have to keep fighting, even though it\u0027s a pain in the butt.","I kind of like to be a little bit removed from how everybody else is doing.","Sometimes I worry that Griffin\u0027s going to fall in love with some woman who just lays in bed all the time because that\u0027s what he sees his mother doing in the first two years of his life. I mean, he\u0027s going to fall in love with some woman who lies in bed and eats bonbons or something, or reads or something, because that seems to be what I\u0027m turning into is this person who lies in bed all the time. Or else I lie on the couch and read him books or something.","Because it\u0027s scary. It\u0027s hard for me to hear every detail of how everyone else is doing because all that could be happening to me.","I was like, wait a second. I haven\u0027t won anything here. We don\u0027t know whether this worked. We know I got through this, but that\u0027s little consolation. The really big prize here, the car, the trip to Hawaii, is did the cancer go away? And we didn\u0027t know, and we weren\u0027t going to know for months. And so it was all very weird, everybody congratulating you and patting you on the back and saying good for you and hey, it\u0027s all over now. It seemed very strange to me.","It feels tight around my nose. And it feels sort of stuffy. And it just feels like it\u0027s hard to sleep in because it\u0027s big, and I feel kind of like an elephant or something with this big nose. I can\u0027t eat with it on or do anything. I just feel like I have to stay very still. Watching TV is good.","I\u0027m feeling well enough to try some Sugar Smacks.","It didn\u0027t help to see the transplant patients who were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going, and they looked so weak shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well.","Mm-hmm.","The treatment requires I stay in the hospital isolation room for a week. And for 18 hours a day, I have to wear this ridiculous-looking and very uncomfortable mask strapped to my face so I can breathe in an aerosol medicine. Here\u0027s something that people forget. It\u0027s not just physically grueling being sick. It\u0027s boring.","And they\u0027re off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?","[HUMMING]","Griffy, you\u0027ve gotten so big. I\u0027m sorry I had to be away for so long. I was away, but I\u0027m back now. Are you my Griffy?

She did a lot of stories about doctors and medicine. Then she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and entered the medical world as a patient. She had six months of radiation and chemotherapy. It didn\u0027t work. So in the winter of 1996, as a last attempt to save her life, she and Tom traveled from their home in Maryland to Omaha, Nebraska, to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for a bone marrow transplant and another round of chemotherapy, a round of chemotherapy as much as 10 times stronger than the original. Dan Collison, a friend of theirs and a radio producer, went with them, and he documented what happened. He also interviewed Rebecca a year later.

First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he\u0027s supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don\u0027t think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I\u0027m a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they\u0027re affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"And they\u0027re off on a big road trip.

I\u0027d do it at like 7:25, right before Seinfeld. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I\u0027d miss Seinfeld. So I\u0027d hurry myself along.

Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn\u0027t there. He was older than Thomas.

And it\u0027s sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real.

I figured I wouldn\u0027t mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn\u0027t hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was like looking at a Holocaust victim, all skin and bones.

And that was just a strange sensation, the way your jaw freezes up and your tongue starts sucking down your throat."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. There are the ones who get their chemo and get out, and there are the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter, a lot of patients have gotten influenza. They\u0027re on respirators, and they\u0027re taking a long time to recover. There is a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean, cozy apartment we have rented. I sit on the rose-covered couch and watch the sparrows out the window. It\u0027s very cold."},{"speakerName":"Mike Bradley","text":"WOW FM, Omaha-Council Bluffs. Good morning, I\u0027m Mike Bradley.

Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It\u0027s the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha."},{"speakerName":"Ruth Kessinger","text":"The machine empties the cells into a very important, special bag. We take the bag of cells to the laboratory. And in the laboratory, we freeze them in a liquid nitrogen freezer and save them there. Then the patient can go get his or her high-dose therapy. The high-dose therapy, of course, is intended to kill tumor cells. But the doses are so high that it also hurts the bone marrow. And that\u0027s the reason you need to give the stem cells back to the patient so they can grow a new bone marrow."},{"speakerName":"Ruth Kessinger","text":"So as soon as the high-dose therapy is finished, and hopefully the cancer is finished too-- it\u0027s been killed-- then we get the cells out of the freezer. We thaw them, and we simply inject them back into the bloodstream of the patient. And like a miracle, these stem cells know where to go. They home right to the empty bone marrow space and begin to grow."},{"speakerName":"Woman 9","text":"Hi, can I help you?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Hi, I\u0027m supposed to be admitted."},{"speakerName":"Woman 9","text":"Oh, OK.

They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I\u0027d say, no. And then she would say, well, I don\u0027t mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I\u0027d say, no.

One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but as a patient, I had to be a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics. And for support, I had Tom, who I call [? Zuli, ?] and he was a huge comfort to me."},{"text":"Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something, we just sort of called a truce or something, each of us did.

And I\u0027m here because last night at about 11 o\u0027clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I\u0027d just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"It was beating really fast.

And I sat down on a chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over because the next thing I knew I was on the floor."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"And then I heard a thud. And I came running out. And Bec was spread eagle on her back, just flat on her back, staring up. And I went and looked in her face, looked in her eyes. And she wasn\u0027t registering. And I said, Bec, Bec, can you hear me? Bec. And she just didn\u0027t register me. Her eyes were blank. And I was just scared [BLEEP] that something had really happened, like she had had a heart attack or a stroke or something. And then within a couple seconds, she came back. And she registered me."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120."},{"speakerName":"Man 6","text":"Hi, I just stopped by to tell you the results of the ECHO. And I think you already know. There was no fluid around the heart. The valves are normal. The heart function normal."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"And then by the end of the day, Dr. [? Taryntula ?] comes in, who\u0027s a great guy, a sweet guy. And he says, I don\u0027t know what problem is. We may never know. Let\u0027s just hope it doesn\u0027t happen again. And that\u0027s where we have left it. And that\u0027s completely unsatisfying, you know?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"So they don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t know. They\u0027re not even going to treat it, really. I think I\u0027d feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you\u0027ll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don\u0027t. We\u0027re no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything\u0027s OK. They think it\u0027s behind us, and we\u0027re not really going to treat it. But I don\u0027t know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary."},{"text":"That has stayed with me in a way that nothing else has because it\u0027s like losing your innocence or something. I mean, it just seems like this weird thing. My heart isn\u0027t supposed to ever stop, and my heart has been stopped. And to me, that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It\u0027s almost like everything else is OK, but that really gets me somehow. I wish that hadn\u0027t happened."},{"speakerName":"Kathy Byar","text":"So if we can treat this and get it under control, get the virus gone before your white cells return, then that\u0027s the best way to do it."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Four days after the transplant, and I\u0027m about to go home to our apartment.

It\u0027s not just physically grueling being sick. It\u0027s boring."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"It feels tight around my nose. And it feels sort of stuffy. And it just feels like it\u0027s hard to sleep in because it\u0027s big, and I feel kind of like an elephant or something with this big nose. I can\u0027t eat with it on or do anything.

You\u0027re not what I\u0027d call trouble."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn\u0027t even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we\u0027re not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. But that anger kept me from being worried or scared, because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would get something similar to pneumonia or I wouldn\u0027t be able to breathe."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]"},{"text":"Just down the hall, Graham has been on a respirator for more than a week.

And so you\u0027re totally drawn into the process, and you\u0027re not really thinking about the final goal at all. The cancer, we know that it\u0027s there. We\u0027re here for that.

And in fact, the truth is, usually, from now on, things are downhill."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"It was really nice and reassuring to have him say that because we had had a sort of a small setback, where I had had more chemo, and when we looked at the tests, that chemo hadn\u0027t done anything to shrink the tumor. And so you worry that the bone marrow transplant isn\u0027t even going to work. And he said, really without any information, I\u0027m very pleased with how everything went, with this undertone of, you\u0027ve probably made it. It\u0027s probably worked. You\u0027re probably OK. I don\u0027t know how he would have known that, or maybe he was bluffing.

We don\u0027t know whether this worked. We know I got through this, but that\u0027s little consolation. The really big prize here, the car, the trip to Hawaii, is did the cancer go away? And we didn\u0027t know, and we weren\u0027t going to know for months. And so it was all very weird, everybody congratulating you and patting you on the back and saying good for you and hey, it\u0027s all over now.

It\u0027s hard to know for sure if it\u0027s completely gone."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"It\u0027s definitely not smaller?"},{"speakerName":"Julie Vose","text":"A lot smaller. A lot smaller."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Oh, OK. Well, that\u0027s good. Yeah, thank you."},{"speakerName":"Julie Vose","text":"Yeah, well, you did all the work."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it\u0027s possible that what we\u0027re seeing, the reason it\u0027s somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there\u0027s scar tissue. So hopefully that\u0027s what it is and we\u0027re OK. And so that\u0027s nice. It\u0027s good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air. We need that music. [SINGING] You might just make it after all."},{"text":"It\u0027s funny when you realize you\u0027re going to get your life back, that your job isn\u0027t just fighting a disease anymore. Suddenly you have to live. Egad. You can\u0027t just sit around and wait to be better. You\u0027ve got to go back to work or at least do something. Study biology, write a book. That was very strange and difficult for me at first, because for the past year and a half, I\u0027d been doing very little. Reading, resting, looking through catalogs. I was scared to go back to work, to face getting dressed every day, to be busy, on deadline, frantic, to let my orderly life and my time with Griffin get away from me."},{"text":"One year since my transplant. The tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease is gone. I\u0027m back at work, but my energy is still low. I\u0027m tired a lot, and when Griffin gets sick with a cold, I get sick too. And I get it bad. Still, we go on vacation. Tom and I went to Rome this fall. We see friends, make dinner. We even fight. And though my life is pretty good, I don\u0027t feel ecstatic, but I feel content. And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who\u0027s the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don\u0027t go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I\u0027m really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn\u0027t matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven\u0027t changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven\u0027t changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won\u0027t."}]},"3":{"actNumber":3,"actName":"Credits","contributorMap":{"Announcer":{"name":"Announcer","episodes":{"103":"Scenes from A Transplant"},"statements":["PRI.

There are the people who are healthy, like him, and people who are sick, other people. And unconsciously, as we all do, he drew a line between the two groups, the two countries. Then when Paul Cowan was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, he was struck with the fact that these are not, of course, two different populations, the sick and the healthy. Instead he wrote, \"The world is composed of the sick and the not yet sick.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He published an account of his illness in The Village Voice. \"I want to describe some of what I\u0027ve seen during the voyage I\u0027ve made, the journey from being a person who took his health for granted to one who\u0027s trying to survive a life-threatening illness. I want to chart some of this wilderness for others who will be here one day.\" Well, that\u0027s the mission of today\u0027s radio program, because all of us, you and me both, if we\u0027re lucky, if we don\u0027t die when we\u0027re young, this is where we\u0027re heading, heart disease, cancer. Men have a one in two lifetime chance of getting cancer. For women, it\u0027s one in three. If you\u0027re a man hearing the sound of my voice right now, I want you to look at yourself for a moment. It\u0027s you or me, man. Odds are one of us will get it. Or we\u0027ll both get it. Two other guys will go off scot-free."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So let us chart this terrain where, if we all live long enough, we will be entering. Cowan writes, \"During the past five months, I\u0027ve learned that there\u0027s a land of the sick. When you receive a passport, an unwelcome diagnosis, you learn that the land has its own language-- medical terminology-- its own geography-- hospitals, outpatient clinics, blood testing labs, doctors\u0027 offices-- its own citizens-- other sick people-- its own pantheon of heroes and authority figures-- doctors, medical researchers, hospital administrators-- its own calendar dictated by the changes in one\u0027s body or by the results of medical tests.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you\u0027re well, it\u0027s hard to remember what it\u0027s like to be sick. And after just a brief time in the hospital, Cowan found it hard to remember what it was like for him just weeks before to be active and self-sufficient. His picture of himself changed. He struggled to retain ties to the land of the healthy, to see himself as an exile who would return one day. But he did not return."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass.

Today on our program, Scenes from a Transplant."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In 1995, Rebecca Perl had a new baby boy that she and her partner, Tom, named Griffin. She was a health science reporter with National Public Radio in Washington, D.C., where she\u0027d just won a Peabody Award for an investigative series about the tobacco industry. She did a lot of stories about doctors and medicine. Then she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and entered the medical world as a patient. She had six months of radiation and chemotherapy. It didn\u0027t work. So in the winter of 1996, as a last attempt to save her life, she and Tom traveled from their home in Maryland to Omaha, Nebraska, to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for a bone marrow transplant and another round of chemotherapy, a round of chemotherapy as much as 10 times stronger than the original. Dan Collison, a friend of theirs and a radio producer, went with them, and he documented what happened. He also interviewed Rebecca a year later. This is her story."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Daddy and Dan and I are going away, Griffy, for a little. We\u0027re going on a trip. You\u0027re going to stay with Grandpa and Grandma, with Pop-Pop and Grandma, OK?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Sometimes I worry that Griffin\u0027s going to fall in love with some woman who just lays in bed all the time because that\u0027s what he sees his mother doing in the first two years of his life. I mean, he\u0027s going to fall in love with some woman who lies in bed and eats bonbons or something, or reads or something, because that seems to be what I\u0027m turning into is this person who lies in bed all the time. Or else I lie on the couch and read him books or something."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"\"Once there were three baby owls, Sarah, Percy, and Bill. They lived in a hole in the trunk of a tree with their mother owl. The hole had twigs and leaves and owl feathers in it. It was their house. One night they woke up and their mother owl was gone. \u0027Where\u0027s Mommy?\u0027 said Sarah. \u0027Oh, my goodness,\u0027 said Percy. \u0027I want my mommy,\u0027 said Bill.\""},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"He really likes the owl book, and it makes him feel better that in the owl book, the mommy owl goes away but then she comes back. So I think he understands that. And lots of mothers go away on trips and go off for work for weeks at a time. And I\u0027ve had to do that. Now the really bad one is I\u0027m going to have to go away for a month or more. And he\u0027ll hopefully come visit. But still, it\u0027s going to be a really long time. I mean, it happens. And I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that he can have a mother."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"OK."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"OK."},{"speakerName":"Griffin","text":"OK."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Bye bye, Griffy. We\u0027ll see you soon, OK? Bye bye. You stay with Grandpa and Mama, OK? Say bye bye."},{"speakerName":"Griffin","text":"[SCREAMS]"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"OK, OK. You go to Pop-Pop.

Bye-bye."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Bye, Griffy. You\u0027ll be OK. Bye-bye."},{"speakerName":"Woman 1","text":"They\u0027re coming back. They\u0027re coming back. Don\u0027t cry."},{"speakerName":"Griffin","text":"[CRYING] Dada."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"There are at least three reasons why I was supposed to be exempt from getting seriously sick. First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he\u0027s supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don\u0027t think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I\u0027m a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they\u0027re affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"And they\u0027re off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?"},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches."},{"text":"Maybe it was a little crazy to drive all the way to Omaha in the dead of winter, but I hate to fly, and Tom likes road trips. I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at The Waffle House."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"We\u0027re in the bathroom of The Waffle House. Did you lock the door?"},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"And I\u0027m going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It\u0027s just like being a heroine addict."},{"text":"For me, it was the worst part, having to give myself shots. For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that\u0027s it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I\u0027d do it at like 7:25, right before Seinfeld. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I\u0027d miss Seinfeld. So I\u0027d hurry myself along. Now I\u0027m doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House. So I give myself a treat afterwards."},{"speakerName":"Man 1","text":"BLT on wheat."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Mmm! Waffle House. Chicken melt. Oh, boy."},{"text":"December 1. After three days on the road, we make it to Omaha."},{"speakerName":"Woman 2","text":"Have a seat, and we\u0027ll be with you in just a minute, OK?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I\u0027m feeling pretty rotten from the ill effects of my final round of chemotherapy back in Washington. They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn\u0027t in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this, my bladder hurts and I\u0027m tired. And I\u0027m about to embark on a nasty, exhausting journey. I feel as if I need more strength, but here we go."},{"speakerName":"Woman 3","text":"We\u0027re going to do your EKG right in this room."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"OK."},{"text":"The first week in Omaha felt like boot camp. I shuffled from one test to another."},{"speakerName":"Man 2","text":"Three more seconds. Keep going. A couple more breaths. Stop. Good. Good test."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Endless poking and prodding."},{"speakerName":"Woman 4","text":"OK, Rebecca, you\u0027re going to feel a poke and a burn. This is the numbing medication."},{"speakerName":"Woman 5","text":"There\u0027s a tiny little poke. I\u0027m sorry. Your skin\u0027s a tiny bit tough."},{"speakerName":"Woman 6","text":"One more to go after this, honey. It\u0027s not bothering you, is it? OK."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I\u0027m just tired of being poked and prodded and pricked and achy and tired. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can\u0027t imagine it being any worse."},{"speakerName":"Kathy Byar","text":"Tomorrow-- don\u0027t eat or drink after midnight tonight. Tomorrow at 8 o\u0027clock, you\u0027ll go down to the first floor of the hospital to special x-rays."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Kathy Byar was my nurse coordinator. She seemed more interested in keeping me on schedule than in what I was going through. We called her my drill sergeant."},{"speakerName":"Kathy Byar","text":"You know, I would imagine it does feel like that because you lose that control. All of a sudden, you\u0027re coming to a strange institution. They\u0027re telling you when, where, and what to do. And as a person that\u0027s young, independent, used to having her own kind of control, it\u0027s very frustrating."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I\u0027m a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren\u0027t used to pushy New Yorkers in Omaha."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"You\u0027ve got to get me on a later schedule. I\u0027m too exhausted."},{"text":"And I didn\u0027t like Kathy\u0027s cheerleading."},{"speakerName":"Kathy Byar","text":"Positive attitude. Positive attitude. You\u0027re not going to feel sick."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I just wasn\u0027t in the mood, you know? I\u0027d been through a lot already. And I was tired. I remember she would say, positive attitude, positive attitude. And I just felt like hell, you know? I had a positive attitude the first time around, and it didn\u0027t work. I mean, now I was going through something even worse. And it was hard for me to keep positive."},{"speakerName":"Kathy Byar","text":"You\u0027re not going to feel sick. Not going to get sick. Not going to get sick."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"One coping mechanism I did have was to act like a health reporter. I was obsessed with the numbers. It was really important for me to know the odds that the transplant would work. Those odds were about 50-50. So sometimes, sitting in a room with other patients, I couldn\u0027t help but think that only about half of us were going to make it. And this made it kind of hard to get close to people. But Graham and his family was an exception."},{"speakerName":"Graham Brazier","text":"Hi, ?] I\u0027m Graham [? Brazier. ?] I\u0027m here for a bone marrow transplant because of multiple myeloma, which is a disease that was diagnosed in May of \u002796."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Graham was a young father facing worse odds than me."},{"speakerName":"Graham Brazier","text":"The latest statistics are that three years out from transplant, 35% are disease-free, as they call it."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their 9-month-old redheaded son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn\u0027t there. He was older than Thomas. He was nearly a year and a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much. And I didn\u0027t want him to have to understand anything."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Hi, Griffy! Hi, Griffy!"},{"text":"So I settled for the occasional phone call."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Hey, Griffy, want me to sing \"Macaroni\"? I have a little pony. His name is Macaroni. He trots and trots and then he stops. My funny little pony, Macaroni. Do you like that song, Griffy?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I don\u0027t know. In a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself from him, because I know I have to go through this and do this. And it\u0027s sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real. So a lot of times I don\u0027t have the energy for him, and that makes it easier to kind of separate from him."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Griffy, I miss you. I\u0027ll see you soon. I love you. I love you, Griffy."},{"speakerName":"Computerized Voice","text":"Breathe in. Hold your breath."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"December 10. We get some bad news. The CAT scan shows the most recent round of chemotherapy back in Washington hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor nearly at all. Julie Vose is my doctor in Omaha."},{"speakerName":"Julie Vose","text":"Rebecca still has a mass found on her CT scan. So we\u0027re going to administer another cycle of salvage chemotherapy that\u0027s a slightly different type, to try and reduce that mass further down before she actually undergoes the transplant. And we\u0027ve found in the past that this is the best way to try and have the best long-term outcome for patients."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"The good news is I\u0027m actually feeling much better. So that night, we celebrate."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"We\u0027re even out at a restaurant. Not just any restaurant, but a find of a restaurant, this Catfish Lodge here in Omaha, with the white albino catfish in the tank in the middle. I\u0027m actually feeling good tonight. It\u0027s like a miracle. I haven\u0027t felt like this. I\u0027m not, like, crying or in pain or something."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Two days later, I begin the Omaha chemo."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"They give you four drugs, and one of them is blue. I kind of like the blue one, because it\u0027s just so startling. It looks like blue food coloring kind of color or like blueberry frozen popsicle melted."},{"speakerName":"Man 3","text":"And you said that you dressed accordingly today?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison."},{"text":"The American Cancer Society offers classes in how you can look better and feel better. And though it sounded hokey at the time, now I understand why they do this. Getting sick really played havoc with my body image. I felt as if my body had betrayed me like a separate person I couldn\u0027t trust. My sexual desire went out the window. I figured I wouldn\u0027t mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn\u0027t hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was like looking at a Holocaust victim, all skin and bones. Actually, I\u0027ve always been tiny and scrawny, but I never minded before. So I avoided mirrors and wore a hat even when the weather got warm. I did break down and let Tom style the little bit of fuzz that was still left on my head."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"This is the weapon. It\u0027s small but very effective. Let\u0027s see. I\u0027ve got to do a little experimental swatch here."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Don\u0027t be doing the top."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. Trust me. Just trust me."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Those are famous last words."},{"speakerName":"Computerized Voice","text":"Breathe in. Hold your breath."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I just had a CT scan. They\u0027re looking to compare the tumor in the chest to how it was in October, see if it\u0027s shrunk."},{"speakerName":"Computerized Voice","text":"Breathe."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"The blue chemo hasn\u0027t shrunk the tumor either. So finally it\u0027s time to get on with the bone marrow transplant."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I mean, it\u0027s discouraging that the tumor hasn\u0027t shrunk any. I was hoping it would shrink with these last bunch of chemos. I\u0027m just anxious to get done. And I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s really going to work. And I\u0027m kind of wondering about what\u0027s the chances it\u0027s really going to work. They can\u0027t be as good as they would be if the tumor had shrunk a lot."},{"speakerName":"Woman 8","text":"Is it OK if I go ahead and get your consent form signed today, so we\u0027re all ready to go when you\u0027re ready to go?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"speakerName":"Woman 8","text":"OK."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"The consent form is a reminder of what I\u0027m in for. It lists all sorts of nasty things that could and sometimes do happen when you have a bone marrow transplant-- kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure."},{"speakerName":"Woman 8","text":"It sounds really scary, and that\u0027s because we have to put every little last thing in here that could possibly happen. That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s going to happen. But we have to let you know that\u0027s a rare possibility."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"It didn\u0027t help to see the transplant patients who were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going, and they looked so weak shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well."},{"speakerName":"Graham Brazier","text":"Everybody ?] seems to be different. And some people, I understand, end up on ventilators. The worst thing I experienced up there, apart from the nausea, was lockjaw. And that was just a strange sensation, the way your jaw freezes up and your tongue starts sucking down your throat."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. There are the ones who get their chemo and get out, and there are the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter, a lot of patients have gotten influenza. They\u0027re on respirators, and they\u0027re taking a long time to recover. There is a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean, cozy apartment we have rented. I sit on the rose-covered couch and watch the sparrows out the window. It\u0027s very cold."},{"speakerName":"Mike Bradley","text":"WOW FM, Omaha-Council Bluffs. Good morning, I\u0027m Mike Bradley.

Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It\u0027s the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha."},{"speakerName":"Ruth Kessinger","text":"The machine empties the cells into a very important, special bag. We take the bag of cells to the laboratory. And in the laboratory, we freeze them in a liquid nitrogen freezer and save them there. Then the patient can go get his or her high-dose therapy. The high-dose therapy, of course, is intended to kill tumor cells. But the doses are so high that it also hurts the bone marrow. And that\u0027s the reason you need to give the stem cells back to the patient so they can grow a new bone marrow."},{"speakerName":"Ruth Kessinger","text":"So as soon as the high-dose therapy is finished, and hopefully the cancer is finished too-- it\u0027s been killed-- then we get the cells out of the freezer. We thaw them, and we simply inject them back into the bloodstream of the patient. And like a miracle, these stem cells know where to go. They home right to the empty bone marrow space and begin to grow."},{"speakerName":"Woman 9","text":"Hi, can I help you?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Hi, I\u0027m supposed to be admitted."},{"speakerName":"Woman 9","text":"Oh, OK.

You\u0027re just going to do it. It\u0027s just going to happen. And I just sort of feel like with this it\u0027s the same thing. It\u0027s like this momentum, and it\u0027s just going to happen, and I\u0027m going to do it.

You can ask, but sometimes you have very little power."},{"text":"During my high dose chemo, I find out that Graham is back in the hospital on a ventilator.

They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I\u0027d say, no. And then she would say, well, I don\u0027t mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I\u0027d say, no.

One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but as a patient, I had to be a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics. And for support, I had Tom, who I call [? Zuli, ?] and he was a huge comfort to me."},{"text":"Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something, we just sort of called a truce or something, each of us did.

And I\u0027m here because last night at about 11 o\u0027clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I\u0027d just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"It was beating really fast.

And I sat down on a chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over because the next thing I knew I was on the floor."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"And then I heard a thud. And I came running out. And Bec was spread eagle on her back, just flat on her back, staring up. And I went and looked in her face, looked in her eyes. And she wasn\u0027t registering. And I said, Bec, Bec, can you hear me? Bec. And she just didn\u0027t register me. Her eyes were blank. And I was just scared [BLEEP] that something had really happened, like she had had a heart attack or a stroke or something. And then within a couple seconds, she came back. And she registered me."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120."},{"speakerName":"Man 6","text":"Hi, I just stopped by to tell you the results of the ECHO. And I think you already know. There was no fluid around the heart. The valves are normal. The heart function normal."},{"speakerName":"Tom Jennings","text":"And then by the end of the day, Dr. [? Taryntula ?] comes in, who\u0027s a great guy, a sweet guy. And he says, I don\u0027t know what problem is. We may never know. Let\u0027s just hope it doesn\u0027t happen again. And that\u0027s where we have left it. And that\u0027s completely unsatisfying, you know?"},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"So they don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t know. They\u0027re not even going to treat it, really. I think I\u0027d feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you\u0027ll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don\u0027t. We\u0027re no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything\u0027s OK. They think it\u0027s behind us, and we\u0027re not really going to treat it. But I don\u0027t know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary."},{"text":"That has stayed with me in a way that nothing else has because it\u0027s like losing your innocence or something. I mean, it just seems like this weird thing. My heart isn\u0027t supposed to ever stop, and my heart has been stopped. And to me, that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It\u0027s almost like everything else is OK, but that really gets me somehow. I wish that hadn\u0027t happened."},{"speakerName":"Kathy Byar","text":"So if we can treat this and get it under control, get the virus gone before your white cells return, then that\u0027s the best way to do it."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Four days after the transplant, and I\u0027m about to go home to our apartment.

It\u0027s not just physically grueling being sick. It\u0027s boring."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"It feels tight around my nose. And it feels sort of stuffy. And it just feels like it\u0027s hard to sleep in because it\u0027s big, and I feel kind of like an elephant or something with this big nose. I can\u0027t eat with it on or do anything.

You\u0027re not what I\u0027d call trouble."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"That was just miserable because I had to be on this machine for 18 hours for seven days. And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn\u0027t even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we\u0027re not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me.

We don\u0027t know whether this worked. We know I got through this, but that\u0027s little consolation. The really big prize here, the car, the trip to Hawaii, is did the cancer go away? And we didn\u0027t know, and we weren\u0027t going to know for months.

I mean, this isn\u0027t what you expect, you know? I mean, it\u0027s rare that people die from the bone marrow transplant, but I guess it happens. But it\u0027s rare when you get your own cells. I don\u0027t know. I just feel sorry for Lorraine. Because she\u0027s got two little kids. One is just one year old, and one is eight years old. That\u0027s a lot.

Last time we checked in, it was two by one. That\u0027s pretty close to being what we would consider normal size for a lymph node. So it\u0027s definitely a lot smaller. It\u0027s hard to know for sure if it\u0027s completely gone."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"It\u0027s definitely not smaller?"},{"speakerName":"Julie Vose","text":"A lot smaller.

Yeah, thank you."},{"speakerName":"Julie Vose","text":"Yeah, well, you did all the work."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it\u0027s possible that what we\u0027re seeing, the reason it\u0027s somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there\u0027s scar tissue. So hopefully that\u0027s what it is and we\u0027re OK. And so that\u0027s nice. It\u0027s good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air.

Suddenly you have to live. Egad. You can\u0027t just sit around and wait to be better. You\u0027ve got to go back to work or at least do something. Study biology, write a book. That was very strange and difficult for me at first, because for the past year and a half, I\u0027d been doing very little. Reading, resting, looking through catalogs. I was scared to go back to work, to face getting dressed every day, to be busy, on deadline, frantic, to let my orderly life and my time with Griffin get away from me."},{"text":"One year since my transplant. The tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease is gone. I\u0027m back at work, but my energy is still low. I\u0027m tired a lot, and when Griffin gets sick with a cold, I get sick too. And I get it bad. Still, we go on vacation. Tom and I went to Rome this fall. We see friends, make dinner. We even fight. And though my life is pretty good, I don\u0027t feel ecstatic, but I feel content. And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick."},{"speakerName":"Rebecca Perl","text":"Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who\u0027s the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don\u0027t go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I\u0027m really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn\u0027t matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven\u0027t changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven\u0027t changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won\u0027t."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Scenes From a Transplant was produced by Dan Collison with help from Tom Jennings, to whom this story is dedicated.
