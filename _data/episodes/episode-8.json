{"episodeNumber":8,"episodeTitle":"New Year","contributorMap":{"Karen Hutt":{"name":"Karen Hutt","episodes":{"8":"New Year"},"statements":["We were a part of the experiment. There were about three black families, and lots of good will and excitement about this experiment. So I talked about my friend Randy Goldstein in the sermon, about how she and I were really good friends, and our parents got to know each other real well. And they were learning how to play pinochle, and we were learning how to play Mah Jongg and eating matzo ball soup, and they were eating collard greens. So we were this perfect notion of how we were going to all live together in multicultural heaven.","But then one day, after about the fifth or sixth, or maybe it was the ninth or tenth black family moved into the neighborhood, Randy said she was moving. And I said, why are you moving, Randy? And she says, well, my mother says it\u0027s getting a little dark around here. So I realized that she wasn\u0027t really talking about an eclipse. It was probably about me and my color and my neighbors.","Well, I know in the very beginning when we moved to this neighborhood-- which I was really resisting, because all my friends were the other neighborhood, the old neighborhood, not the new neighborhood. And the new neighborhood was something for my father to tell his friends about. I\u0027d hear him on the phone and he\u0027d be talking to his friends and saying, yeah, man, we\u0027re the only ones out here. And I\u0027d listen to him like, the only ones out where? What was this all about for him?","So clearly, for my parents, it was a big move to a really big house and a lot of prestige and all this kind of thing. But for me, I did feel like an experiment, because people I didn\u0027t know in the neighborhood would stop and smile at me, and say they\u0027re glad that I\u0027m there, and do all these kinds of things. Even sometimes giving out little candies to us, like we were some kind of prize. But that all made me always feel a little uncomfortable, because I could never trust that it was going to be real. Because as soon as I would get comfortable and trust, it would be shattered by a comment or a stare or a glare or people following us around or saying things about us. But all that sort of changed when the numbers changed. And that\u0027s what really made a big difference.","Well, it was maybe 50%. When it was 50%. Integration for a lot of white people-- I found it to be like one black family in the whole neighborhood, that\u0027s integration. But for African-Americans, we like the idea of 50-50. That seemed about right. So when it got to be 50-50, the integration dream was dashed. It was just gone.","Whites fled. And we have to also realize that the real estate agents did a lot to contribute to this. It wasn\u0027t just people leaving. They were actually offered a lot. But the thing that I found curious was that all the blacks that were moving in had much more material wealth or better jobs. Like, most of the Jewish people in the neighborhood were teachers and social workers, and our families were politicians and judges and lawyers and doctors. And we found it rather curious that they wouldn\u0027t want to live with us. Because we knew it wasn\u0027t economic at that point.","Yeah, I was very angry about it. But I\u0027m really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of. I\u0027m smarter for it, I think. But I was angry at the time.","I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me.","I felt used, maybe, later because my father was a politician. So I later saw all these pictures in the paper. You know, \"First Black Integrates the School.\" The newspaper coming, taking pictures of the American Negro family that\u0027s integration-bound. But other than the political ramifications, I don\u0027t think I felt used. Because you have to realize, too, my parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society, absolute segregation. We were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they wanted to realize it in whatever way they could. So I don\u0027t think I could even look back and find fault with any of their choices, because they were basically a product of all of those times.","This next interview is with Finley Campbell, who\u0027s a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party and very active in the social justice and environmental justice movement in our church. He\u0027s a civil rights activist that goes way back. And he also was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978.","Well, Alex Poinsett is a longstanding member of our church. He used to be on the senior staff at Ebony Magazine as a writer. And he grew up in Inglewood in the \u002720s and \u002730s. And his first experience with integration was in high school. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. Blacks were just ignored. They stayed completely segregated when he was in the Navy. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college.","And what did he mean by, like your daughter? What was it that you--","Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. But one of the things that he told us is that even though this pro-white faction left the church, it didn\u0027t really make that much of a difference.","Well, this is Finley Campbell. Like I said earlier, he\u0027s an activist. And he\u0027s been involved in issues in the South and the North. And he has a lot to share here.","Now, what do you say to people who think that integration happened, and now we need to move into more segregated, separate kinds of worlds within the country? What do you say to them? Because that seems like a growing movement and commentary that a lot of people who are in the Afro-centric movement are talking about. What do you say about that?","This next tape is from John Rice. He came to the church, I think, in the \u002770s. So maybe he was hiding out. He was a Black Panther at the time, and a lot {\"? heat on","Him. So he came to our church and became involved in the activities there, and has been there ever since. And he said that he found the closest thing to real integration is in our church. In the outside world, he says, there\u0027s a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black.","One of the things, I think, that\u0027s made people in our church feel as if integration has worked is that people have substantial, authentic relationships with one another. And I think that\u0027s a really big difference, is that it\u0027s been a long haul. George is still there. Betty is still there. Charlotte is still there. All these folks are still around, struggling with these issues. Maybe not talking about them in the same tone, but they\u0027re still part of building a community. And I think the dream is still alive for many people, because of that church. But I think the authenticity of the relationships means that certain things have worked for them.","Thank you.","It was fun.","[MUSIC -- \"STOP THAT ALABAMA BUS\"]"],"spokenWords":["Yeah, I was very angry about it.

So he turns around and asks his wife if it was OK with her. And she said yes. I just totally fell in love with that.","They wanted you to get fired, I think. Can you say something besides losing your job that you want to forget, that happened to you this year?","You come here, cruise for a while, kill time, see who\u0027s around, pick up some liquor, and go to the lake. I talked to this girl in the record store about why girls come down here to cruise.","He says it feels like you\u0027re in Mexico here. He comes here to see the paisanos. He came here with his friends so they could get to know Little Village.","She said it will always stay with her, deep down inside, because she never got the chance to meet her grandfather.

She says she\u0027s learned you\u0027ve got to fight for what you want in this life. She knows that it\u0027s not going to fall from the sky.","You can\u0027t pass on 26th Street without noticing Rossi Brothers. They have beautiful furniture, and this is the stuff people in the neighborhood want to buy-- the people with money, and the people without.","He had a wish for 1996.","Miguel is a salesperson at CJ\u0027s. When I saw him, I knew for sure that he would speak English. I could just tell. He\u0027s 19, has a goatee, is tall, [INAUDIBLE] complexion. I asked him how his year was.","They found out.","Did it help you in any way, being in jail? Like, straighten up your head?","Pussy.","Why\u0027d you get fired?","Yes?","Well, this is a tape we bought at the discount mall. It\u0027s called Tracks are for Kids.","He says he misses his family in Mexico, but if he was there, he says, he\u0027d just be doing drugs instead of making money to help his family.","Everyone comes to 26th Street.

The loto men are on every other corner selling corn, cucumbers, tamales, Mexican antojitos. It\u0027s as busy as Michigan Avenue downtown.","Yeah, I\u0027m going to write a book.","Was it in Spanish or in English?","I thought he just wanted it for business.","Well, I don\u0027t know. We\u0027ll see if he calls.","How old is she?","But something did happen to him that was more dramatic than a robbery or a shooting.","I want to know.","A girl sitting with her friends also had a pretty bad year. Part of it was that she was going to Mexico to go visit her grandfather for the first time, and she received a call from some relatives informing her that her grandfather had been killed.","Bad?

But Chicago has more Mexicans than any other United States city except for Los Angeles. It\u0027s over 1 million people.

According to the Chamber of Commerce in Little Village, in 1995 the number of stores in the neighborhood actually increased 20%. The salesmen at Rossi Brothers had a good year.","Over at the discount mall, some stores had a good year. For some, it was so-so.

But overall, Ricardo summed up 1995 in one word.","But when he was 13, would he take you with him?

But overall, Ricardo summed up 1995 in one word.","And trying to get a sense of the year by means of these big summary year-end stories, it\u0027s like trying to get a sense of the United States by flying across the country in a jet and looking out the window. You see lots of pretty colors and lots of interesting shapes, but the people look like ants. Well, at this, Your Radio Playhouse, we prefer the camera to move in a little closer for a better look. And so now that we have some distance, some objectivity on the past year-- we have, what is it, five days of complete objectivity. We\u0027ve invited Claudia Perez to tell us what the year was like in one small Chicago neighborhood.","[MUSIC -- \"ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\" BY THE BEATLES]","He is definitely calling you.","When did she say it?","Claudia.","OK, doesn\u0027t this music sound more vital, more alive, than the certain music of a certain group of aging baby-boom \u002760s era-- you, you, beloved listener, you be the judge.","But when he was 13, would he take you with him? Was there a time when he would take you all the time?","When\u0027s the first date going to happen?","We headed over to the cosmetics counter.

According to the Chamber of Commerce in Little Village, in 1995 the number of stores in the neighborhood actually increased 20%. The salesmen at Rossi Brothers had a good year.","Is this music, is this little tape the most irritating thing we have ever put onto the-- OK, I\u0027m just going to stop it-- the most irritating thing we have ever done? All right, enough of that.","Does she know yet that you want to go out with her?","The box of it looks like the cereal box, Trix are for kids, with the little bunny.","No, he never took you.","Tacanos. She\u0027s saying they\u0027re cheap. Over the years, so many Mexicans have done well in Chicago that lots of them have moved away from this neighborhood to the suburbs. This woman said 80% of her customers this year were Mexicans who\u0027ve moved to the suburbs but who have come back here to shop.","When we asked about \u002796, Mario said next year was going to be nicer. Every year will be nicer, he said.","We found two of the policemen who patrol 26th Street standing at a graphic design office. They said community policing is one of the main reasons crime rates are going down here. Now people are more willing to sign complaints and appear in court. It didn\u0027t used to be that way.","Lowrider Magazine on sale here.","1995 was fine for him, he said. He finally got a stable job in a restaurant. He doesn\u0027t have to be jumping from factory to factory.","He was quiet for a second. His girlfriend shook her head, no.","Well, other radio and television programs have spent much of the last week trying to summarize the past year. We have seen or heard the year in music, the year in films, the year in world events and world politics, the year in fashion. I\u0027m sure somewhere out there, there\u0027s a cheese magazine that\u0027s done the year in cheese. You know. It was a big year for Roquefort, or-- I don\u0027t even know any cheese names.

There were about three black families, and lots of good will and excitement about this experiment. So I talked about my friend Randy Goldstein in the sermon, about how she and I were really good friends, and our parents got to know each other real well. And they were learning how to play pinochle, and we were learning how to play Mah Jongg and eating matzo ball soup, and they were eating collard greens. So we were this perfect notion of how we were going to all live together in multicultural heaven.","But then one day, after about the fifth or sixth, or maybe it was the ninth or tenth black family moved into the neighborhood, Randy said she was moving. And I said, why are you moving, Randy? And she says, well, my mother says it\u0027s getting a little dark around here. So I realized that she wasn\u0027t really talking about an eclipse. It was probably about me and my color and my neighbors.","Well, I know in the very beginning when we moved to this neighborhood-- which I was really resisting, because all my friends were the other neighborhood, the old neighborhood, not the new neighborhood. And the new neighborhood was something for my father to tell his friends about. I\u0027d hear him on the phone and he\u0027d be talking to his friends and saying, yeah, man, we\u0027re the only ones out here. And I\u0027d listen to him like, the only ones out where? What was this all about for him?","So clearly, for my parents, it was a big move to a really big house and a lot of prestige and all this kind of thing. But for me, I did feel like an experiment, because people I didn\u0027t know in the neighborhood would stop and smile at me, and say they\u0027re glad that I\u0027m there, and do all these kinds of things. Even sometimes giving out little candies to us, like we were some kind of prize. But that all made me always feel a little uncomfortable, because I could never trust that it was going to be real. Because as soon as I would get comfortable and trust, it would be shattered by a comment or a stare or a glare or people following us around or saying things about us. But all that sort of changed when the numbers changed. And that\u0027s what really made a big difference.","Well, it was maybe 50%. When it was 50%. Integration for a lot of white people-- I found it to be like one black family in the whole neighborhood, that\u0027s integration. But for African-Americans, we like the idea of 50-50. That seemed about right. So when it got to be 50-50, the integration dream was dashed. It was just gone.","Whites fled. And we have to also realize that the real estate agents did a lot to contribute to this. It wasn\u0027t just people leaving. They were actually offered a lot. But the thing that I found curious was that all the blacks that were moving in had much more material wealth or better jobs. Like, most of the Jewish people in the neighborhood were teachers and social workers, and our families were politicians and judges and lawyers and doctors. And we found it rather curious that they wouldn\u0027t want to live with us. Because we knew it wasn\u0027t economic at that point.","Yeah, I was very angry about it. But I\u0027m really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of. I\u0027m smarter for it, I think. But I was angry at the time.","I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me.","I felt used, maybe, later because my father was a politician. So I later saw all these pictures in the paper. You know, \"First Black Integrates the School.\" The newspaper coming, taking pictures of the American Negro family that\u0027s integration-bound. But other than the political ramifications, I don\u0027t think I felt used. Because you have to realize, too, my parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society, absolute segregation. We were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they wanted to realize it in whatever way they could. So I don\u0027t think I could even look back and find fault with any of their choices, because they were basically a product of all of those times.","This next interview is with Finley Campbell, who\u0027s a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party and very active in the social justice and environmental justice movement in our church. He\u0027s a civil rights activist that goes way back. And he also was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978.","Well, Alex Poinsett is a longstanding member of our church. He used to be on the senior staff at Ebony Magazine as a writer. And he grew up in Inglewood in the \u002720s and \u002730s. And his first experience with integration was in high school. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. Blacks were just ignored. They stayed completely segregated when he was in the Navy. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college.","And what did he mean by, like your daughter? What was it that you--","Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. But one of the things that he told us is that even though this pro-white faction left the church, it didn\u0027t really make that much of a difference.","Well, this is Finley Campbell. Like I said earlier, he\u0027s an activist. And he\u0027s been involved in issues in the South and the North. And he has a lot to share here.","Now, what do you say to people who think that integration happened, and now we need to move into more segregated, separate kinds of worlds within the country? What do you say to them? Because that seems like a growing movement and commentary that a lot of people who are in the Afro-centric movement are talking about. What do you say about that?","This next tape is from John Rice. He came to the church, I think, in the \u002770s. So maybe he was hiding out. He was a Black Panther at the time, and a lot {\"? heat on","Him. So he came to our church and became involved in the activities there, and has been there ever since. And he said that he found the closest thing to real integration is in our church. In the outside world, he says, there\u0027s a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black.","One of the things, I think, that\u0027s made people in our church feel as if integration has worked is that people have substantial, authentic relationships with one another. And I think that\u0027s a really big difference, is that it\u0027s been a long haul. George is still there. Betty is still there. Charlotte is still there. All these folks are still around, struggling with these issues. Maybe not talking about them in the same tone, but they\u0027re still part of building a community. And I think the dream is still alive for many people, because of that church. But I think the authenticity of the relationships means that certain things have worked for them.","Thank you.","It was fun.","[MUSIC -- \"STOP THAT ALABAMA BUS\"]"],"spokenWords":["Yeah, I was very angry about it.

It was just gone.","Now, what do you say to people who think that integration happened, and now we need to move into more segregated, separate kinds of worlds within the country? What do you say to them? Because that seems like a growing movement and commentary that a lot of people who are in the Afro-centric movement are talking about. What do you say about that?","This next tape is from John Rice. He came to the church, I think, in the \u002770s. So maybe he was hiding out. He was a Black Panther at the time, and a lot {\"? heat on","So clearly, for my parents, it was a big move to a really big house and a lot of prestige and all this kind of thing. But for me, I did feel like an experiment, because people I didn\u0027t know in the neighborhood would stop and smile at me, and say they\u0027re glad that I\u0027m there, and do all these kinds of things. Even sometimes giving out little candies to us, like we were some kind of prize. But that all made me always feel a little uncomfortable, because I could never trust that it was going to be real. Because as soon as I would get comfortable and trust, it would be shattered by a comment or a stare or a glare or people following us around or saying things about us. But all that sort of changed when the numbers changed. And that\u0027s what really made a big difference.","We were a part of the experiment. There were about three black families, and lots of good will and excitement about this experiment. So I talked about my friend Randy Goldstein in the sermon, about how she and I were really good friends, and our parents got to know each other real well. And they were learning how to play pinochle, and we were learning how to play Mah Jongg and eating matzo ball soup, and they were eating collard greens. So we were this perfect notion of how we were going to all live together in multicultural heaven.","But then one day, after about the fifth or sixth, or maybe it was the ninth or tenth black family moved into the neighborhood, Randy said she was moving. And I said, why are you moving, Randy? And she says, well, my mother says it\u0027s getting a little dark around here. So I realized that she wasn\u0027t really talking about an eclipse. It was probably about me and my color and my neighbors.","Well, this is Finley Campbell. Like I said earlier, he\u0027s an activist. And he\u0027s been involved in issues in the South and the North. And he has a lot to share here.","Him. So he came to our church and became involved in the activities there, and has been there ever since. And he said that he found the closest thing to real integration is in our church. In the outside world, he says, there\u0027s a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black.","Well, Alex Poinsett is a longstanding member of our church. He used to be on the senior staff at Ebony Magazine as a writer. And he grew up in Inglewood in the \u002720s and \u002730s. And his first experience with integration was in high school. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. Blacks were just ignored. They stayed completely segregated when he was in the Navy. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college.","And what did he mean by, like your daughter? What was it that you--","Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. But one of the things that he told us is that even though this pro-white faction left the church, it didn\u0027t really make that much of a difference.","I felt used, maybe, later because my father was a politician. So I later saw all these pictures in the paper. You know, \"First Black Integrates the School.\" The newspaper coming, taking pictures of the American Negro family that\u0027s integration-bound. But other than the political ramifications, I don\u0027t think I felt used. Because you have to realize, too, my parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society, absolute segregation. We were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they wanted to realize it in whatever way they could. So I don\u0027t think I could even look back and find fault with any of their choices, because they were basically a product of all of those times.","Thank you.","Whites fled. And we have to also realize that the real estate agents did a lot to contribute to this. It wasn\u0027t just people leaving. They were actually offered a lot. But the thing that I found curious was that all the blacks that were moving in had much more material wealth or better jobs. Like, most of the Jewish people in the neighborhood were teachers and social workers, and our families were politicians and judges and lawyers and doctors. And we found it rather curious that they wouldn\u0027t want to live with us. Because we knew it wasn\u0027t economic at that point.","One of the things, I think, that\u0027s made people in our church feel as if integration has worked is that people have substantial, authentic relationships with one another. And I think that\u0027s a really big difference, is that it\u0027s been a long haul. George is still there. Betty is still there. Charlotte is still there. All these folks are still around, struggling with these issues. Maybe not talking about them in the same tone, but they\u0027re still part of building a community. And I think the dream is still alive for many people, because of that church. But I think the authenticity of the relationships means that certain things have worked for them.","I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me.","This next interview is with Finley Campbell, who\u0027s a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party and very active in the social justice and environmental justice movement in our church. He\u0027s a civil rights activist that goes way back. And he also was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978.","[MUSIC -- \"STOP THAT ALABAMA BUS\"]","Well, I know in the very beginning when we moved to this neighborhood-- which I was really resisting, because all my friends were the other neighborhood, the old neighborhood, not the new neighborhood. And the new neighborhood was something for my father to tell his friends about. I\u0027d hear him on the phone and he\u0027d be talking to his friends and saying, yeah, man, we\u0027re the only ones out here. And I\u0027d listen to him like, the only ones out where?

It\u0027s a story that I began over a year ago, and it involved many, many other people. It\u0027s one of these stories that actually involved an entire church. And for 10 months, I have not been able to walk down 57th Street without looking over my shoulder in fear that I\u0027m going to run into one of these people, because I had not finished the story. But now I am proud to say, the story, it is here. It is here, and it is here to stay. Though I guess that doesn\u0027t really mean anything when you say it on the radio. Well, at least it\u0027s here, and I will be set free."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The story does involve this entire church, a historic church here in Chicago. And we\u0027ll get to that part. But first we have to talk about how it begins, because it begins with this woman named Karen Hutt. And Karen Hutt is normally the director of religious education at this church. It\u0027s the First Unitarian Church of Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And one Sunday morning, a while back, I\u0027ll admit, when the senior minister was away, Karen Hutt did a guest sermon. And she talked about a very unusual experience that she had as a child. Karen Hutt was the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools. This was in the 1960s."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So first of all, for a moment, let\u0027s set our minds back away from the current debate over quotas and overturning affirmative action. Let\u0027s turn our minds back now to a more hopeful moment in American race relations. And in her sermon, she talked about what went right and what went wrong in this thing that she witnessed herself."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And what happened was that her family moved to a white, Jewish neighborhood. And she enrolled in the white public school there."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"We were a part of the experiment. There were about three black families, and lots of good will and excitement about this experiment. So I talked about my friend Randy Goldstein in the sermon, about how she and I were really good friends, and our parents got to know each other real well. And they were learning how to play pinochle, and we were learning how to play Mah Jongg and eating matzo ball soup, and they were eating collard greens. So we were this perfect notion of how we were going to all live together in multicultural heaven."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"But then one day, after about the fifth or sixth, or maybe it was the ninth or tenth black family moved into the neighborhood, Randy said she was moving. And I said, why are you moving, Randy? And she says, well, my mother says it\u0027s getting a little dark around here. So I realized that she wasn\u0027t really talking about an eclipse. It was probably about me and my color and my neighbors."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Karen, let me ask you. Did you feel like you were a guinea pig? Or did you feel like you were able to have a normal life?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, I know in the very beginning when we moved to this neighborhood-- which I was really resisting, because all my friends were the other neighborhood, the old neighborhood, not the new neighborhood. And the new neighborhood was something for my father to tell his friends about. I\u0027d hear him on the phone and he\u0027d be talking to his friends and saying, yeah, man, we\u0027re the only ones out here. And I\u0027d listen to him like, the only ones out where? What was this all about for him?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"So clearly, for my parents, it was a big move to a really big house and a lot of prestige and all this kind of thing. But for me, I did feel like an experiment, because people I didn\u0027t know in the neighborhood would stop and smile at me, and say they\u0027re glad that I\u0027m there, and do all these kinds of things. Even sometimes giving out little candies to us, like we were some kind of prize. But that all made me always feel a little uncomfortable, because I could never trust that it was going to be real. Because as soon as I would get comfortable and trust, it would be shattered by a comment or a stare or a glare or people following us around or saying things about us. But all that sort of changed when the numbers changed. And that\u0027s what really made a big difference."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s interesting how few the numbers have to be for it to change. How many African-American families had moved in before the total environment change."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, it was maybe 50%. When it was 50%. Integration for a lot of white people-- I found it to be like one black family in the whole neighborhood, that\u0027s integration. But for African-Americans, we like the idea of 50-50. That seemed about right. So when it got to be 50-50, the integration dream was dashed. It was just gone."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Because whites fled."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Whites fled. And we have to also realize that the real estate agents did a lot to contribute to this. It wasn\u0027t just people leaving. They were actually offered a lot. But the thing that I found curious was that all the blacks that were moving in had much more material wealth or better jobs. Like, most of the Jewish people in the neighborhood were teachers and social workers, and our families were politicians and judges and lawyers and doctors. And we found it rather curious that they wouldn\u0027t want to live with us. Because we knew it wasn\u0027t economic at that point."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you ever feel angry at your parents for putting you in this situation?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Yeah, I was very angry about it. But I\u0027m really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of. I\u0027m smarter for it, I think. But I was angry at the time."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Angry in what terms?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you feel used?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"I felt used, maybe, later because my father was a politician. So I later saw all these pictures in the paper. You know, \"First Black Integrates the School.\" The newspaper coming, taking pictures of the American Negro family that\u0027s integration-bound. But other than the political ramifications, I don\u0027t think I felt used. Because you have to realize, too, my parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society, absolute segregation. We were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they wanted to realize it in whatever way they could. So I don\u0027t think I could even look back and find fault with any of their choices, because they were basically a product of all of those times."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So Karen Hutt told her church about the good things and the bad in her experience as a racial pioneer. And the reaction she got from the congregation at the First Unitarian Church was sort of surprising. Coming up, their reaction and their stories. It\u0027s Your Radio Playhouse."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC -- \"DRIVE MY CAR\" BY THE BEATLES]"},{"text":"It\u0027s Your Radio Playhouse. I\u0027m Ira Glass. So after Karen Hutt gave a sermon about her experience as the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools, lots of members of the congregation came to her and said, well, I was the first black person in this neighborhood, or I was the first African-American to integrate this Girl Scout camp, or I was the first African-American in this department at the University of Chicago."},{"text":"And Karen Hutt came to believe that for middle-class blacks, the story of the last 30 years is the story that begins with the sentence, I was the first black who. And so many stories were coming forward. First Unitarian is this integrated church and was a hotbed of political activism. In the \u002760s and the \u002770s, they hid Black Panthers. Old Mayor Daley would send his Red Squad to wait outside the church in cars. And lots of people at the First Unitarian Church had been involved in various integration struggles. And after Karen Hutt\u0027s sermon, they talked about doing an oral history of their experiences with integration. But they hadn\u0027t gotten around to it, and so we lent them a tape recorder, we at this radio show. And we asked them to do their oral history for our program. Karen Hutt did the interviews with a young woman named Laura Finnegan."},{"text":"And Laura had the opposite experience Karen had as a child. Or, well, maybe it\u0027s the same experience. It depends how you see this. It was either the opposite experience or it was exactly the same experience. For much of her childhood, Laura\u0027s family was one of the few white families in South Shore, on the south side of Chicago."},{"text":"And by the time she was in eighth grade, she was one of two white children in her grade. And she describes it as just as just a confusing time. She describes it as just a confusing time. You do the grammar of that sentence. She says that it was just as confusing for her as it was for Karen Hutt. And sometimes she wished she were black so she could fit in better. It really created a lot of questions of who she was and who she should be, and how she should get along with people."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"When the violence in the neighborhood started to increase somewhat, we had been robbed at gunpoint. And it was a terrifying experience for me. And we would ask my family, are we going to move? And they would say, well, yeah, maybe we\u0027ll move. And the feeling that was conveyed was, well, if we move, then we\u0027re betraying this ideal of integration. And so at the time, I felt like, well, what is that ideal, and why are we here when I don\u0027t feel comfortable here all the time? Although I think on other levels, that idea that we were betraying the integration was also just an excuse for other personal reasons for why we were staying in the neighborhood."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, let\u0027s get to some of the tape that the two of you collected. One of the things that\u0027s interesting in the material that you\u0027ve played me before coming in here is that generally, when we hear stories about being the first person to integrate a school or a neighborhood or a job situation, we\u0027re used to hearing horror stories. But in your interviews with members of your church, one of the things that\u0027s striking is how often people told you about moments and times where things worked out OK. And many people told you stories about somebody-- a boss or a coworker or a teacher or a friend-- who would look out for them and help get them jobs and appointments, help them find housing in an otherwise exclusive neighborhood that was trying to keep blacks out. Let me ask you to talk about some of that tape. Let\u0027s play a little bit of that."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"OK. One of the people that I interviewed was a gentleman named Richard Jennifer. He\u0027s in his late 60\u0027s now, and he was an engineer for a subsidiary of the New York Times. He started working for the New York Times in the early \u002750s."},{"speakerName":"Richard Jennifer","text":"Race was not really a real concern, because we all tended to go around, pal around, play around with each other on our off hours, as well as our working days."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"The interesting part about talking to Richard was that I learned his employer went to pretty great lengths to ensure that he was able to perform his job without the usual racial barriers impeding his ability to work."},{"speakerName":"Richard Jennifer","text":"I was beginning to travel quite a bit and beginning to fly quite a bit. And somehow or other, it came up one day-- a question was asked of me. Dick, were you aware of the fact that there\u0027s been an entourage that went ahead of you to clear the road so that when you came to the hotels or whatever, there was no racial things involved? And I said, absolutely not. Because it just wasn\u0027t something that I was aware of."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"This next interview is with Finley Campbell, who\u0027s a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party and very active in the social justice and environmental justice movement in our church. He\u0027s a civil rights activist that goes way back. And he also was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"Thinking about my experience with integration-- boy, there were a bunch of them. But the one that really sticks out is with my eating broiled rabbit with a Kentucky white brother named Junior Osbourne and his wife Rosemary. We were in this little town of Crawfordsville, Indiana. And I am the-- pardon the expression-- the black leader of the white folks. Because no one else wanted to reach out to the quote, \"rednecks,\" unquote, except me. And there\u0027s a long story behind that."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"But right now, I\u0027m eating dinner with Junior Osbourne and his wife Rosemary. And they bring out this stewed rabbit. It is so good. It is so delicious. And we\u0027re sitting there eating and talking, and talking about the food stamps program and things like that. And here is this guy who had been my nightmare, the redneck, drawling, working-class, white man with his white wife. And I\u0027m sitting there, the radical supporter of the Black Panther party and all that stuff. And we\u0027re sharing this rabbit, and it is so good. And I said, how did you learn how to cook rabbit black style? And he said, what do you mean, black style? This is the way we white folks always cook it."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"And then it dawned on me that there is a Southern unity. There was always a form of cultural integration in the South, in which law acted as the wall to keep us divided, not personal desire or personal experience, for many people. Not all, but for many people. So that really stuck out in my mind, having that rabbit with Junior Osbourne. And that turned me completely away from any blackism I may have had about white folks who are not capable of making change."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"All right. Well, let\u0027s get to some of the tougher experiences people had as racial pioneers."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, Alex Poinsett is a longstanding member of our church. He used to be on the senior staff at Ebony Magazine as a writer. And he grew up in Inglewood in the \u002720s and \u002730s. And his first experience with integration was in high school. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. Blacks were just ignored. They stayed completely segregated when he was in the Navy. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college."},{"speakerName":"Alex Poinsett","text":"Well, the University of Illinois in Champaign was like North Mississippi. In my own case, I was obliged to sit-- the only black in a particular classroom-- and have to tolerate a professor telling a \"nigger in the woodpile joke, and not realizing that, well, there\u0027s a black person here who might be offended by that. And after that particular session, I recall vividly him realizing that he had committed a faux pas and trying very, very hard to be apologetic and so forth. I just simply walked away from him."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"Another person that we talked to was Charlotte Lackner. And she was also at the University of Illinois around the same time that Alex Poinsett was there."},{"speakerName":"Charlotte Lackner","text":"People bought that anybody who really was straight with black people-- they were Communists or something. They were not people who were regular people, you know."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"The blacks thought that?"},{"speakerName":"Charlotte Lackner","text":"Yeah. Well, that\u0027s the way it was. When I went to Illinois, you couldn\u0027t live in the dorms. And at Chicago, you could. At Chicago you could live in the dorms. People used to call this a Communist school in those days. They were always talking about the Communists, the Reds, at Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"One of the other people that we talked to was Pauline McCool. She came to the church as a Sunday School teacher, but she ended up as the first black member of the First Unitarian Church in Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Pauline Mccool","text":"I said to my mom and dad, hey, I\u0027m joining the church. Would you come and be with me? So I came over. And as I say, I ran in, raised my hand, was accepted. Unknown to me, on that day, the president of the board went to my father. And he had this conversation with him, stating that, oh, well, it\u0027s all right if the people who come are like your daughter."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"And what did he mean by, like your daughter? What was it that you--"},{"speakerName":"Pauline Mccool","text":"OK, I\u0027m assuming that, since it was not told to me for several years later-- my father was quite hurt and knew that I was so enthusiastic about this church. Had I known that, I would have been disillusioned at a time when I was just forming an opinion of what was truth and what was reality and all the rest of it."},{"speakerName":"Pauline Mccool","text":"I\u0027m sure that he was indicating that, OK, these are middle-class blacks. They own their own home. This girl is in college. She\u0027s going to be a professional. Whatever it meant, soon that faction left the church."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. But one of the things that he told us is that even though this pro-white faction left the church, it didn\u0027t really make that much of a difference."},{"speakerName":"Alex Poinsett","text":"We made some pretty good friendships here. Although I think many of the whites, even in those early days-- my wife felt church members were constantly on pins and needles, fearful of, on the one hand, being offensive to me or being so naive in their relationship with me as to inadvertently as to offend me. And the striking thing about that experience was that there was no concerted effort on the part of the church to \"integrate,\" in quotes, the liturgy. Whatever black spirituality you brought to the church you parked outside of the door. You didn\u0027t bring it inside the door. I mean, if you were into hand-clapping and shouting and all of that, you left that part at the door. Because you would be an embarrassment, you see."},{"speakerName":"Alex Poinsett","text":"So that\u0027s one-way integration. That sort of integration says, you get like me, and whatever it is that is unique to you, you leave that behind. That\u0027s cultural suicide."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"When civil rights began to emerge on the scene and began to be a factor and people began to think about it, there was a real effort to do things in an integrated. way"},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"This is George Reed, who was somebody that I interviewed at length. He was a chemist professionally. His experience was interesting, because he noted that in the beginning of the civil rights movement, there were a lot of goodwill gestures on the part of whites. And I think he felt that that was a good thing, but I think soon thereafter, and I mean over the course of years, those goodwill gestures began to diminish."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"We were invited to innumerable homes and events and whatnot in the suburbs, which I hated to go to because I always got lost. I just automatically go the wrong way, no matter how clear the directions are. And I always got lost, and I hated it. But the people were wonderful. And we had wonderful experiences, and we developed some very good friendships."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"And then, it was sort of like a flash in the pan. This sort of thing kind of faded away. I don\u0027t know whether it was due to the militancy of the blacks or whether the fact that the whites decided that it was too much trouble to be trying to do all these types of reaching-out things. They had enough to do in their own communities, with their own relationships and whatnot. I don\u0027t know what went on in the white mind. But I think in the black mind, probably, the attitude was, look-- I guess the best way I can describe it is related to the church."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"There was a sort of a meeting here at the church, downstairs in the basement. And we were all down there. And they had this person who was an expert at bringing these people together and getting people talking and thinking in buzz groups. And this thing went round and round and round. And I\u0027ll never forget that, because I was really upset and annoyed by the sort of cavalier attitude that many whites took about the sort of problems that we were trying to deal with. And finally I got up and said, listen, you can all walk out of here, and you\u0027re white and you can go do whatever you want. We will all walk out here, and we\u0027re still black. And we can\u0027t change that. So I think something did happen, that blacks decided, OK, look, no more of this accomodation stuff."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Now, your church is a kind of living history of people who have tried this accommodation stuff, as George Reed says. There are a lot of people there who have really tried to make integration work in their lives. And given the ongoing public debate across the country about how to integrate, whether to integrate, whether it accomplishes anything worthwhile, I know that one of the things you asked your church members was, do they think it\u0027s worth it? Do they feel hopeful about integration? Do they think it\u0027s worth trying to do, given their experience?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, this is Finley Campbell.

Remember, we had our last integration bill in \u002765, and then \u002766 the Black Power movement hit on the one end. And then Nixon hit in \u002768 on the other end. And then there is a white-skin privilege and this, that, and the other popped up. So we can no longer talk about a mass integrationist process. It was short-circuited. It was betrayed, to be blunt. So we\u0027ve got to talk about integration moments. And not only have I seen them and experienced them, they fill me with hope."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Now, what do you say to people who think that integration happened, and now we need to move into more segregated, separate kinds of worlds within the country? What do you say to them? Because that seems like a growing movement and commentary that a lot of people who are in the Afro-centric movement are talking about. What do you say about that?"},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"Well, I say that many of those people never really experienced true down-home segregation. One of the top Afro-centrist persons, whose name I will not mention, was actually reared in a small town in Minnesota. So of course, with that kind of experience, being the only black, being around very few blacks, you\u0027re going to feel like, my God, let me get as black as I can. But those of us who came up through the old Southern days, with the black churches, black conventions, black schools-- we know what that\u0027s like.

I think maybe many people in the white community are running scared themselves. They want to survive. And whites have grown up in a society that condones bigotry in many respects."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"And even whites who are liberated from that, they still have that baggage that they have to carry, just like blacks have a baggage that they have to carry that says that maybe they aren\u0027t up to it or that they\u0027re not deserving, or that this country doesn\u0027t belong to them like it belongs to everybody else. It\u0027s something that\u0027s so subtle and pervasive that it\u0027s going to take probably, even with the best intentions, a few generations to purge. }}}}}+"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"This next tape is from John Rice.

So he came to our church and became involved in the activities there, and has been there ever since. And he said that he found the closest thing to real integration is in our church. In the outside world, he says, there\u0027s a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black."},{"speakerName":"John Rice","text":"And I\u0027ve had people from both communities who are-- well, you know you\u0027re black, don\u0027t you? Well, you know you\u0027re black, don\u0027t you? Well, you know you\u0027re a nigger, don\u0027t you? So in that sense, this Unitarian society gave me that freedom. I can be the asshole that I want to be. And nobody says, that\u0027s that black asshole. They just say, that\u0027s John. He\u0027s who he is, right? So I like that freedom."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"One of the things, I think, that\u0027s made people in our church feel as if integration has worked is that people have substantial, authentic relationships with one another. And I think that\u0027s a really big difference, is that it\u0027s been a long haul. George is still there. Betty is still there. Charlotte is still there. All these folks are still around, struggling with these issues. Maybe not talking about them in the same tone, but they\u0027re still part of building a community. And I think the dream is still alive for many people, because of that church. But I think the authenticity of the relationships means that certain things have worked for them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah. Do you want to say something, Laura?"},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"Yeah. And I wanted to say, I think that is what sort of drew me to the church initially. I mean, I came to the church at a point where I thought, I live in two different worlds still, and it\u0027s driving me crazy. I live on the North side, and I grew up on the South side, and I swear to god they\u0027re still two different cities."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"And for me, I needed to reconcile that. And when I came to First Unitarian and I saw that people were still struggling with these issues, I thought, OK, I haven\u0027t lost my mind. People are still struggling with this. And maybe-- George talks about the burden that he felt that he thought that whites didn\u0027t share. And yet I think that in some small way, I feel that burden too, because I don\u0027t want to live in a world where we can only live in harmony if we live separately.

They have been rendered in human scale and not one inch bigger."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Are you going to wear these Hong Kong suits that you\u0027ve had made?"},{"speakerName":"John Lennon","text":"George and I haven\u0027t had any made. Paul\u0027s had one. That\u0027s all."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Now, Paul, you\u0027ve bought a Chinese suit?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"Yes, it\u0027s true. Two, I got."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Did you? How much did you pay for them?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"It wasn\u0027t very dear. About 10 quid, I think. Yeah. Oh, it was great, actually, because somebody said, \"You\u0027ve got to haggle and get the prices down.\" So some little fellow was selling some ornaments. And he wanted $160 for them. No, he was selling a watch. That\u0027s it. He wanted 160 Hong Kong dollars for it. So I kept saying to him, \"No that\u0027s not right. Not right. $100, that\u0027s right.\" You know?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Happy birthday, Ringo. Any good presents?"},{"speakerName":"Ringo Starr","text":"Um, a few, you know. Quite a few."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Any in particular?"},{"speakerName":"Ringo Starr","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Paul, do you feel that your vacation here in Los Angeles was a success even though you didn\u0027t have very much privacy?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Did you mind the girls on the hill?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Well, what was your most enjoyable part of your vacation?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"Just lazing around."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"What is the sort of stuff they like over there on the Hit Parade?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"Uh, wilder stuff, I think. We stuck in a wilder number."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"They go for the Elvis Presley type of stuff, there, do they? I mean, they go for the older rock and roll stuff?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"I think so, yeah, a bit more."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"By the way, from WBEZ in Chicago, this is Your Radio Playhouse. Today, the year in the life of one neighborhood and a generation in the life of one church. Unusual stories of this, our American life, as always. Stay with us."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Is this music, is this little tape the most irritating thing we have ever put onto the-- OK, I\u0027m just going to stop it-- the most irritating thing we have ever done? All right, enough of that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, other radio and television programs have spent much of the last week trying to summarize the past year. We have seen or heard the year in music, the year in films, the year in world events and world politics, the year in fashion. I\u0027m sure somewhere out there, there\u0027s a cheese magazine that\u0027s done the year in cheese. You know. It was a big year for Roquefort, or-- I don\u0027t even know any cheese names. It was a big year for something."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And trying to get a sense of the year by means of these big summary year-end stories, it\u0027s like trying to get a sense of the United States by flying across the country in a jet and looking out the window. You see lots of pretty colors and lots of interesting shapes, but the people look like ants. Well, at this, Your Radio Playhouse, we prefer the camera to move in a little closer for a better look. And so now that we have some distance, some objectivity on the past year-- we have, what is it, five days of complete objectivity. We\u0027ve invited Claudia Perez to tell us what the year was like in one small Chicago neighborhood."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And Claudia is a high school student. She\u0027s 18 years old. And we hooked up with her through a community group called Street-Level Video. And usually teenagers come to Street-Level Video to make TV stories about their lives and their neighborhoods. This is Claudia\u0027s first radio story."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When people around the country think of Chicago, most of them do not realize how Mexican this city is. But Chicago has more Mexicans than any other United States city except for Los Angeles. It\u0027s over 1 million people. And Little Village is the neighborhood that most new Mexican immigrants come to. Claudia is from this neighborhood and says that the place to go, if you really want to understand what the neighborhood\u0027s like, is 26th Street. She gave me a tour last week."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Everyone comes to 26th Street. It\u0027s a pretty busy place. There\u0027s Lalo\u0027s, Aguascalientes, and the discount mall. There\u0027s a parking lot at Church\u0027s Chicken where people meet up. The loto men are on every other corner selling corn, cucumbers, tamales, Mexican antojitos. It\u0027s as busy as Michigan Avenue downtown."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So there\u0027s Rosie\u0027s Bakery."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH], Supermercados, Upe Travel, Rio Grande Music."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Lowrider Magazine on sale here."},{"text":"There\u0027s a big archway on 26th Street, near the discount mall. The clock on it, donated by the Mexican government, stopped working a few weeks after it was installed. There are also green and white and red lights arranged in the shape of the Mexican flag, but the green and white ones have been burned out for years."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"That little thing right there says, \"Bienvenidos a Little Village.\" That\u0027s when you\u0027re entering Little Village. You know what a lot of gang-bangers do when they pass this thing? They cross themselves. They\u0027d say [SPEAKING SPANISH] because they\u0027re leaving the neighborhood."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Because they\u0027re leaving the place that they\u0027re safe. In the summer, people come to 26th Street and cruise around when they\u0027re bored."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"You come here, cruise for a while, kill time, see who\u0027s around, pick up some liquor, and go to the lake. I talked to this girl in the record store about why girls come down here to cruise."},{"speakerName":"Girl","text":"To check out the guys, I guess."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"There\u0027s a lot of cute guys. And sometimes it\u0027s sad because they\u0027re gang-bangers. But they\u0027re the finest ones."},{"speakerName":"Girl","text":"Even if you don\u0027t want to really socialize or hang around with them, at least you\u0027ll take a look at them. You just get this tingly feeling inside."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"You can\u0027t pass on 26th Street without noticing Rossi Brothers. They have beautiful furniture, and this is the stuff people in the neighborhood want to buy-- the people with money, and the people without."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And whatever you\u0027ve heard about the terrible shape of the nation\u0027s retail economy, 26th Street is doing fine. According to the Chamber of Commerce in Little Village, in 1995 the number of stores in the neighborhood actually increased 20%. The salesmen at Rossi Brothers had a good year."},{"speakerName":"Rossi Salesman 1","text":"This is the most successful year. We\u0027ve been here 40 years. So why business is better? I don\u0027t know. Maybe it\u0027s because our fathers are retired and we\u0027re younger."},{"speakerName":"Rossi Salesman 2","text":"There\u0027s a definite transformation in the area. All the property\u0027s becoming worthwhile. All the empty vacant lots, they\u0027re putting new houses there, new construction. So this is becoming a vital part of the city."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Over at the discount mall, some stores had a good year. For some, it was so-so. The discount mall is probably 40 or 50 stores packed into an old department store building. Narrow aisles and things stacked way over your head. Spanish music and the Virgin of Guadalupe everywhere. She was on T-shirts and framed pictures. She was on a clock surrounded by tiny colored lights."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"All the stores basically sell the same things-- things from Mexico, from LA, like the Ben Davis suits, cholo shirts. Down the hall is one of the leather stores. Three girls were just sitting there, eating Chinese food. One of them said the most unforgettable thing that happened to her this year was a sale to someone who was Polish."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Usually, she said, the Poles who come to her store look but don\u0027t buy. They worry that the Mexican merchants don\u0027t give them the best price. The merchants see their caution differently."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Tacanos. She\u0027s saying they\u0027re cheap. Over the years, so many Mexicans have done well in Chicago that lots of them have moved away from this neighborhood to the suburbs. This woman said 80% of her customers this year were Mexicans who\u0027ve moved to the suburbs but who have come back here to shop."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"They don\u0027t forget where they come from. In the hallway, we found this man from the suburbs. He says he comes here to get what the Mexicano wears."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"He says it feels like you\u0027re in Mexico here. He comes here to see the paisanos. He came here with his friends so they could get to know Little Village."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"1995 was fine for him, he said. He finally got a stable job in a restaurant. He doesn\u0027t have to be jumping from factory to factory."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Over near the pet store, the staff of CJ\u0027s Clothing is almost all teenagers. One boy is 17, originally from Mexico, from Michoacan. He works but doesn\u0027t go to school. This year he met this girl in Mexico who lived in Chicago. He liked her and followed her over here. Eventually, it didn\u0027t work. But he stayed here, and now he is making money to help out his family."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"He says he misses his family in Mexico, but if he was there, he says, he\u0027d just be doing drugs instead of making money to help his family."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"His little cousin Ricardo is his interpreter. He translates everything for him. Ricardo had a couple of exciting moments in 1995, like when he helped the police catch a thief at the discount mall. The officers were just standing around watching videos on a store TV, when Ricardo told them that a lady was stealing one of those club things you use to protect your car. But overall, Ricardo summed up 1995 in one word."},{"speakerName":"Ricardo","text":"Bad."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Bad? Why bad?"},{"speakerName":"Ricardo","text":"I don\u0027t know. Boring."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Boring? Why has it been boring?"},{"speakerName":"Ricardo","text":"My brother. He bores me. When he goes to places, he doesn\u0027t take me anywhere. He doesn\u0027t take me with him."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"And he\u0027s older than you?"},{"speakerName":"Ricardo","text":"I\u0027m nine and he\u0027s 15."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But when he was 13, would he take you with him? Was there a time when he would take you all the time?"},{"speakerName":"Ricardo","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"No, he never took you."},{"speakerName":"Ricardo","text":"Nowhere."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Miguel is a salesperson at CJ\u0027s. When I saw him, I knew for sure that he would speak English. I could just tell. He\u0027s 19, has a goatee, is tall, [INAUDIBLE] complexion. I asked him how his year was."},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"This year\u0027s been my best year so far. Maybe meeting some more girls, for example. That\u0027s about it."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"He had a wish for 1996."},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"Maybe hook up with some girl that I want right now. No names right now."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Does she know yet that you want to go out with her?"},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"Yeah, she knows."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When\u0027s the first date going to happen?"},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"When her father lets her out."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"How old is she?"},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"She\u0027s like 18, 17."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"And they don\u0027t let her out yet?"},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"Not at all. I guess she\u0027s got one of those strict parents."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We talk to Miguel for a while. In \u002796, he\u0027ll graduate from DeVry to become an electronic technician. He doesn\u0027t party. He doesn\u0027t like trouble in the street. And before long, he asks Claudia for her phone number."},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"Give me your number too. Why don\u0027t you give me your number, and I\u0027ll call you too. And when you\u0027re famous, I\u0027ll be famous with you too."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"All right. I\u0027ll give you-- this is my pager number."},{"text":"I told him I wanted to be a fashion designer and a writer someday, and he said--"},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"OK, you can write a book about me."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Yeah, I\u0027m going to write a book."},{"speakerName":"Miguel","text":"About me, though, right?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We headed over to the cosmetics counter. It appeared to this correspondent that Miguel wanted Claudia\u0027s phone number for a date."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"I thought he just wanted it for business."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He is definitely calling you."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Well, I don\u0027t know. We\u0027ll see if he calls."},{"text":"Next, we went to Los Comales. It\u0027s open 24 hours. It\u0027s the place where everyone goes when they get a hunger attack. I usually stop by at 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning. They have good tortas, the best tortas. I won\u0027t eat tortas from anywhere else. If I\u0027m on a diet, I\u0027ll just drink a licuado de fresa instead of a torta."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s a noisy, friendly place with bright orange booths, a loud jukebox and the blenders going nearly nonstop, making licuados. At one table was a guy with short hair and a big black and white Adidas jacket sitting with his girlfriend. He had a bad year."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"It ain\u0027t been good, man. I got fired from my job."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Why\u0027d you get fired?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Because I lied on my application. Because when they ask you, have you been convicted of felonies, I put no. And later on--"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"They found out."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Yeah. It\u0027s because somebody went into the office and they kind of told on me or something."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"They wanted you to get fired, I think. Can you say something besides losing your job that you want to forget, that happened to you this year?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"This year? Well, I just out of jail."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Did it help you in any way, being in jail? Like, straighten up your head?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He was quiet for a second. His girlfriend shook her head, no."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"It didn\u0027t help you? Are you still stubborn?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Right. The jail ain\u0027t for getting you straight. It just makes you worse."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"What do you plan to do for \u002796?"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve still got my cases pending."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"A girl sitting with her friends also had a pretty bad year. Part of it was that she was going to Mexico to go visit her grandfather for the first time, and she received a call from some relatives informing her that her grandfather had been killed."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"She said it will always stay with her, deep down inside, because she never got the chance to meet her grandfather. But she said this year has made her even stronger. Now she knows that she has to stay in school and continue her education. Now she\u0027s working. She says she\u0027s learned you\u0027ve got to fight for what you want in this life. She knows that it\u0027s not going to fall from the sky."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"The crime rate, it\u0027s low. It\u0027s a lot lower. As far as 26th Street, the merchants, there\u0027s hardly any robberies and very few thefts. The gang situations, that\u0027s being curbed."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We found two of the policemen who patrol 26th Street standing at a graphic design office. They said community policing is one of the main reasons crime rates are going down here. Now people are more willing to sign complaints and appear in court. It didn\u0027t used to be that way."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"When I asked this cop to tell us about the most dramatic thing that happened to him this year, his partner said, \"What about that jewelry store robbery?\""},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Well, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s dramatic. I\u0027ve seen robberies. That was just a typical robbery. I mean, it could be dramatic to somebody else, or the person that got robbed. But to me, it\u0027s just an everyday occurrence for me. So it doesn\u0027t phase me anymore. Or as far as people getting shot and killed. I\u0027m used to it."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"But something did happen to him that was more dramatic than a robbery or a shooting."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Just dramatic-- I bought a brand-new home. Well, I guess it\u0027s not dramatic, but--"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"It\u0027s good. That\u0027s my dream, is to have my own house. I never had a house. I always lived in apartments. That\u0027s nice."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Well, I guess, hard work, and-- it\u0027s on the Southwest side of Chicago. And it\u0027s a split-level home, like a suburban-type home. It\u0027s a nice home, side drive, four bedrooms, two-and-a-half-car garage. Expensive. I have a lot of police officer friends that live in that neighborhood. So I guess that\u0027s what made me buy over there."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"For all the stories you hear about how terrible life is in poor, inner-city neighborhoods, one of the most striking things about 26th Street is how many people told us they\u0027d had a really good year last year."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"We met this young couple who had a baby and a two-year-old daughter. I asked if I could interview the husband, because he was the one carrying the baby. So he turns around and asks his wife if it was OK with her. And she said yes. I just totally fell in love with that."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"When we asked him what was so good about this past year, he said:"},{"speakerName":"Mario Ramirez","text":"Everything. My daughter\u0027s been growing happily and healthy. Real healthy. Steady growing. Everything\u0027s been nice. We\u0027ve got nice blessings this year, you know. We\u0027ve been together for a long time. We\u0027ve already been together for four years. And they say they don\u0027t last, young couples, so we\u0027ve really been lasting together. So that\u0027s real memorable."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He\u0027s 22 and she\u0027s 21, Mario and Alice Ramirez. Like any parents, some of their biggest events of 1995 involved their kids. For example:"},{"speakerName":"Mario Ramirez","text":"There are bad words she says. That\u0027s real cute. One of those bad words she says, they just come out. It\u0027s bad. I don\u0027t want to say it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When did she say it?"},{"speakerName":"Mario Ramirez","text":"Oh, yesterday. Yesterday, right?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Tell us all the story. Where were you guys?"},{"speakerName":"Mario Ramirez","text":"Well, we\u0027re all sitting down, and she don\u0027t really talk that much, and all of a sudden she just came out. She got mad at me and called me a real bad word. She just goes, hey, you-- and everyone started laughing, so it was nice."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Was it in Spanish or in English?"},{"speakerName":"Mario Ramirez","text":"Spanish. No, it was in English actually."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"I want to know."},{"speakerName":"Mario Ramirez","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Pussy."},{"text":"She\u0027s just about to turn three, and this happened at Christmas dinner. You know, Mexican families are big. They were all there, and they all laughed."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When we asked about \u002796, Mario said next year was going to be nicer. Every year will be nicer, he said."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"He held the baby, his wife took her two-year-old daughter\u0027s hand, and they walked away down 26th Street in the snow."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"[MUSIC]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Claudia."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Yes?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We should explain what music this is."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Well, this is a tape we bought at the discount mall. It\u0027s called Tracks are for Kids."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The box of it looks like the cereal box, Trix are for kids, with the little bunny."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"It\u0027s a mix tape. The song here is just to give you a little taste of what the Latinos in the South Side and everywhere else listen to."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"OK, doesn\u0027t this music sound more vital, more alive, than the certain music of a certain group of aging baby-boom \u002760s era-- you, you, beloved listener, you be the judge."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC -- \"ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\" BY THE BEATLES]"},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"John and Paul, you recently produced a record by the Silkie."},{"speakerName":"John Lennon","text":"Yes."},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"Yes."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Do you think you\u0027ll do any more?"},{"speakerName":"John Lennon","text":"Yes."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Do any of you go to church?"},{"speakerName":"Ringo Starr","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Do you want to buy anything in Australia?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"Yes, definitely."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Like what?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"I don\u0027t know."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Do you ever have your hair cut?"},{"speakerName":"John Lennon","text":"Of course."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Do you ever get irritated because you can\u0027t get above the noise of the people screaming at the shows?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Mccartney","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Have you met any interesting American girls?"},{"speakerName":"George Harrison","text":"Not yet."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"What do you think of the police protection you\u0027ve been receiving here in the city?"},{"speakerName":"Ringo Starr","text":"It\u0027s marvelous."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Are the crowds as large as you expected?"},{"speakerName":"John Lennon","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, my New Year\u0027s resolution this past New Year\u0027s was to finish this next story and finally get it on the radio. It\u0027s a story that I began over a year ago, and it involved many, many other people. It\u0027s one of these stories that actually involved an entire church. And for 10 months, I have not been able to walk down 57th Street without looking over my shoulder in fear that I\u0027m going to run into one of these people, because I had not finished the story. But now I am proud to say, the story, it is here. It is here, and it is here to stay. Though I guess that doesn\u0027t really mean anything when you say it on the radio. Well, at least it\u0027s here, and I will be set free."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The story does involve this entire church, a historic church here in Chicago. And we\u0027ll get to that part. But first we have to talk about how it begins, because it begins with this woman named Karen Hutt. And Karen Hutt is normally the director of religious education at this church. It\u0027s the First Unitarian Church of Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And one Sunday morning, a while back, I\u0027ll admit, when the senior minister was away, Karen Hutt did a guest sermon. And she talked about a very unusual experience that she had as a child. Karen Hutt was the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools. This was in the 1960s."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So first of all, for a moment, let\u0027s set our minds back away from the current debate over quotas and overturning affirmative action. Let\u0027s turn our minds back now to a more hopeful moment in American race relations. And in her sermon, she talked about what went right and what went wrong in this thing that she witnessed herself."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And what happened was that her family moved to a white, Jewish neighborhood. And she enrolled in the white public school there."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"We were a part of the experiment. There were about three black families, and lots of good will and excitement about this experiment. So I talked about my friend Randy Goldstein in the sermon, about how she and I were really good friends, and our parents got to know each other real well. And they were learning how to play pinochle, and we were learning how to play Mah Jongg and eating matzo ball soup, and they were eating collard greens. So we were this perfect notion of how we were going to all live together in multicultural heaven."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"But then one day, after about the fifth or sixth, or maybe it was the ninth or tenth black family moved into the neighborhood, Randy said she was moving. And I said, why are you moving, Randy? And she says, well, my mother says it\u0027s getting a little dark around here. So I realized that she wasn\u0027t really talking about an eclipse. It was probably about me and my color and my neighbors."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Karen, let me ask you. Did you feel like you were a guinea pig? Or did you feel like you were able to have a normal life?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, I know in the very beginning when we moved to this neighborhood-- which I was really resisting, because all my friends were the other neighborhood, the old neighborhood, not the new neighborhood. And the new neighborhood was something for my father to tell his friends about. I\u0027d hear him on the phone and he\u0027d be talking to his friends and saying, yeah, man, we\u0027re the only ones out here. And I\u0027d listen to him like, the only ones out where? What was this all about for him?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"So clearly, for my parents, it was a big move to a really big house and a lot of prestige and all this kind of thing. But for me, I did feel like an experiment, because people I didn\u0027t know in the neighborhood would stop and smile at me, and say they\u0027re glad that I\u0027m there, and do all these kinds of things. Even sometimes giving out little candies to us, like we were some kind of prize. But that all made me always feel a little uncomfortable, because I could never trust that it was going to be real. Because as soon as I would get comfortable and trust, it would be shattered by a comment or a stare or a glare or people following us around or saying things about us. But all that sort of changed when the numbers changed. And that\u0027s what really made a big difference."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s interesting how few the numbers have to be for it to change. How many African-American families had moved in before the total environment change."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, it was maybe 50%. When it was 50%. Integration for a lot of white people-- I found it to be like one black family in the whole neighborhood, that\u0027s integration. But for African-Americans, we like the idea of 50-50. That seemed about right. So when it got to be 50-50, the integration dream was dashed. It was just gone."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Because whites fled."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Whites fled. And we have to also realize that the real estate agents did a lot to contribute to this. It wasn\u0027t just people leaving. They were actually offered a lot. But the thing that I found curious was that all the blacks that were moving in had much more material wealth or better jobs. Like, most of the Jewish people in the neighborhood were teachers and social workers, and our families were politicians and judges and lawyers and doctors. And we found it rather curious that they wouldn\u0027t want to live with us. Because we knew it wasn\u0027t economic at that point."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you ever feel angry at your parents for putting you in this situation?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Yeah, I was very angry about it. But I\u0027m really proud about it now, because it was an exciting thing to be a part of. I\u0027m smarter for it, I think. But I was angry at the time."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Angry in what terms?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"I was angry about losing the continuity of a community that I knew loved me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you feel used?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"I felt used, maybe, later because my father was a politician. So I later saw all these pictures in the paper. You know, \"First Black Integrates the School.\" The newspaper coming, taking pictures of the American Negro family that\u0027s integration-bound. But other than the political ramifications, I don\u0027t think I felt used. Because you have to realize, too, my parents had a different kind of dream. They grew up in a fully segregated society, absolute segregation. We were born into this revolution and to this dream and this hope. And they wanted to realize it in whatever way they could. So I don\u0027t think I could even look back and find fault with any of their choices, because they were basically a product of all of those times."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So Karen Hutt told her church about the good things and the bad in her experience as a racial pioneer. And the reaction she got from the congregation at the First Unitarian Church was sort of surprising. Coming up, their reaction and their stories. It\u0027s Your Radio Playhouse."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC -- \"DRIVE MY CAR\" BY THE BEATLES]"},{"text":"It\u0027s Your Radio Playhouse. I\u0027m Ira Glass. So after Karen Hutt gave a sermon about her experience as the first black child to integrate the Philadelphia public schools, lots of members of the congregation came to her and said, well, I was the first black person in this neighborhood, or I was the first African-American to integrate this Girl Scout camp, or I was the first African-American in this department at the University of Chicago."},{"text":"And Karen Hutt came to believe that for middle-class blacks, the story of the last 30 years is the story that begins with the sentence, I was the first black who. And so many stories were coming forward. First Unitarian is this integrated church and was a hotbed of political activism. In the \u002760s and the \u002770s, they hid Black Panthers. Old Mayor Daley would send his Red Squad to wait outside the church in cars. And lots of people at the First Unitarian Church had been involved in various integration struggles. And after Karen Hutt\u0027s sermon, they talked about doing an oral history of their experiences with integration. But they hadn\u0027t gotten around to it, and so we lent them a tape recorder, we at this radio show. And we asked them to do their oral history for our program. Karen Hutt did the interviews with a young woman named Laura Finnegan."},{"text":"And Laura had the opposite experience Karen had as a child. Or, well, maybe it\u0027s the same experience. It depends how you see this. It was either the opposite experience or it was exactly the same experience. For much of her childhood, Laura\u0027s family was one of the few white families in South Shore, on the south side of Chicago."},{"text":"And by the time she was in eighth grade, she was one of two white children in her grade. And she describes it as just as just a confusing time. She describes it as just a confusing time. You do the grammar of that sentence. She says that it was just as confusing for her as it was for Karen Hutt. And sometimes she wished she were black so she could fit in better. It really created a lot of questions of who she was and who she should be, and how she should get along with people."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"When the violence in the neighborhood started to increase somewhat, we had been robbed at gunpoint. And it was a terrifying experience for me. And we would ask my family, are we going to move? And they would say, well, yeah, maybe we\u0027ll move. And the feeling that was conveyed was, well, if we move, then we\u0027re betraying this ideal of integration. And so at the time, I felt like, well, what is that ideal, and why are we here when I don\u0027t feel comfortable here all the time? Although I think on other levels, that idea that we were betraying the integration was also just an excuse for other personal reasons for why we were staying in the neighborhood."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, let\u0027s get to some of the tape that the two of you collected. One of the things that\u0027s interesting in the material that you\u0027ve played me before coming in here is that generally, when we hear stories about being the first person to integrate a school or a neighborhood or a job situation, we\u0027re used to hearing horror stories. But in your interviews with members of your church, one of the things that\u0027s striking is how often people told you about moments and times where things worked out OK. And many people told you stories about somebody-- a boss or a coworker or a teacher or a friend-- who would look out for them and help get them jobs and appointments, help them find housing in an otherwise exclusive neighborhood that was trying to keep blacks out. Let me ask you to talk about some of that tape. Let\u0027s play a little bit of that."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"OK. One of the people that I interviewed was a gentleman named Richard Jennifer. He\u0027s in his late 60\u0027s now, and he was an engineer for a subsidiary of the New York Times. He started working for the New York Times in the early \u002750s."},{"speakerName":"Richard Jennifer","text":"Race was not really a real concern, because we all tended to go around, pal around, play around with each other on our off hours, as well as our working days."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"The interesting part about talking to Richard was that I learned his employer went to pretty great lengths to ensure that he was able to perform his job without the usual racial barriers impeding his ability to work."},{"speakerName":"Richard Jennifer","text":"I was beginning to travel quite a bit and beginning to fly quite a bit. And somehow or other, it came up one day-- a question was asked of me. Dick, were you aware of the fact that there\u0027s been an entourage that went ahead of you to clear the road so that when you came to the hotels or whatever, there was no racial things involved? And I said, absolutely not. Because it just wasn\u0027t something that I was aware of."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"This next interview is with Finley Campbell, who\u0027s a professor at DeVry University and an activist in the Progressive Labor Party and very active in the social justice and environmental justice movement in our church. He\u0027s a civil rights activist that goes way back. And he also was shot in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1978."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"Thinking about my experience with integration-- boy, there were a bunch of them. But the one that really sticks out is with my eating broiled rabbit with a Kentucky white brother named Junior Osbourne and his wife Rosemary. We were in this little town of Crawfordsville, Indiana. And I am the-- pardon the expression-- the black leader of the white folks. Because no one else wanted to reach out to the quote, \"rednecks,\" unquote, except me. And there\u0027s a long story behind that."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"But right now, I\u0027m eating dinner with Junior Osbourne and his wife Rosemary. And they bring out this stewed rabbit. It is so good. It is so delicious. And we\u0027re sitting there eating and talking, and talking about the food stamps program and things like that. And here is this guy who had been my nightmare, the redneck, drawling, working-class, white man with his white wife. And I\u0027m sitting there, the radical supporter of the Black Panther party and all that stuff. And we\u0027re sharing this rabbit, and it is so good. And I said, how did you learn how to cook rabbit black style? And he said, what do you mean, black style? This is the way we white folks always cook it."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"And then it dawned on me that there is a Southern unity. There was always a form of cultural integration in the South, in which law acted as the wall to keep us divided, not personal desire or personal experience, for many people. Not all, but for many people. So that really stuck out in my mind, having that rabbit with Junior Osbourne. And that turned me completely away from any blackism I may have had about white folks who are not capable of making change."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"All right. Well, let\u0027s get to some of the tougher experiences people had as racial pioneers."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, Alex Poinsett is a longstanding member of our church. He used to be on the senior staff at Ebony Magazine as a writer. And he grew up in Inglewood in the \u002720s and \u002730s. And his first experience with integration was in high school. He says, among the people he knew, there was no real mixing. Blacks were just ignored. They stayed completely segregated when he was in the Navy. But he says some of his worst experiences were in college."},{"speakerName":"Alex Poinsett","text":"Well, the University of Illinois in Champaign was like North Mississippi. In my own case, I was obliged to sit-- the only black in a particular classroom-- and have to tolerate a professor telling a \"nigger in the woodpile joke, and not realizing that, well, there\u0027s a black person here who might be offended by that. And after that particular session, I recall vividly him realizing that he had committed a faux pas and trying very, very hard to be apologetic and so forth. I just simply walked away from him."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"Another person that we talked to was Charlotte Lackner. And she was also at the University of Illinois around the same time that Alex Poinsett was there."},{"speakerName":"Charlotte Lackner","text":"People bought that anybody who really was straight with black people-- they were Communists or something. They were not people who were regular people, you know."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"The blacks thought that?"},{"speakerName":"Charlotte Lackner","text":"Yeah. Well, that\u0027s the way it was. When I went to Illinois, you couldn\u0027t live in the dorms. And at Chicago, you could. At Chicago you could live in the dorms. People used to call this a Communist school in those days. They were always talking about the Communists, the Reds, at Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"One of the other people that we talked to was Pauline McCool. She came to the church as a Sunday School teacher, but she ended up as the first black member of the First Unitarian Church in Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Pauline Mccool","text":"I said to my mom and dad, hey, I\u0027m joining the church. Would you come and be with me? So I came over. And as I say, I ran in, raised my hand, was accepted. Unknown to me, on that day, the president of the board went to my father. And he had this conversation with him, stating that, oh, well, it\u0027s all right if the people who come are like your daughter."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"And what did he mean by, like your daughter? What was it that you--"},{"speakerName":"Pauline Mccool","text":"OK, I\u0027m assuming that, since it was not told to me for several years later-- my father was quite hurt and knew that I was so enthusiastic about this church. Had I known that, I would have been disillusioned at a time when I was just forming an opinion of what was truth and what was reality and all the rest of it."},{"speakerName":"Pauline Mccool","text":"I\u0027m sure that he was indicating that, OK, these are middle-class blacks. They own their own home. This girl is in college. She\u0027s going to be a professional. Whatever it meant, soon that faction left the church."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Alex Poinsett joined the church after Pauline McCool. But one of the things that he told us is that even though this pro-white faction left the church, it didn\u0027t really make that much of a difference."},{"speakerName":"Alex Poinsett","text":"We made some pretty good friendships here. Although I think many of the whites, even in those early days-- my wife felt church members were constantly on pins and needles, fearful of, on the one hand, being offensive to me or being so naive in their relationship with me as to inadvertently as to offend me. And the striking thing about that experience was that there was no concerted effort on the part of the church to \"integrate,\" in quotes, the liturgy. Whatever black spirituality you brought to the church you parked outside of the door. You didn\u0027t bring it inside the door. I mean, if you were into hand-clapping and shouting and all of that, you left that part at the door. Because you would be an embarrassment, you see."},{"speakerName":"Alex Poinsett","text":"So that\u0027s one-way integration. That sort of integration says, you get like me, and whatever it is that is unique to you, you leave that behind. That\u0027s cultural suicide."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"When civil rights began to emerge on the scene and began to be a factor and people began to think about it, there was a real effort to do things in an integrated. way"},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"This is George Reed, who was somebody that I interviewed at length. He was a chemist professionally. His experience was interesting, because he noted that in the beginning of the civil rights movement, there were a lot of goodwill gestures on the part of whites. And I think he felt that that was a good thing, but I think soon thereafter, and I mean over the course of years, those goodwill gestures began to diminish."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"We were invited to innumerable homes and events and whatnot in the suburbs, which I hated to go to because I always got lost. I just automatically go the wrong way, no matter how clear the directions are. And I always got lost, and I hated it. But the people were wonderful. And we had wonderful experiences, and we developed some very good friendships."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"And then, it was sort of like a flash in the pan. This sort of thing kind of faded away. I don\u0027t know whether it was due to the militancy of the blacks or whether the fact that the whites decided that it was too much trouble to be trying to do all these types of reaching-out things. They had enough to do in their own communities, with their own relationships and whatnot. I don\u0027t know what went on in the white mind. But I think in the black mind, probably, the attitude was, look-- I guess the best way I can describe it is related to the church."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"There was a sort of a meeting here at the church, downstairs in the basement. And we were all down there. And they had this person who was an expert at bringing these people together and getting people talking and thinking in buzz groups. And this thing went round and round and round. And I\u0027ll never forget that, because I was really upset and annoyed by the sort of cavalier attitude that many whites took about the sort of problems that we were trying to deal with. And finally I got up and said, listen, you can all walk out of here, and you\u0027re white and you can go do whatever you want. We will all walk out here, and we\u0027re still black. And we can\u0027t change that. So I think something did happen, that blacks decided, OK, look, no more of this accomodation stuff."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Now, your church is a kind of living history of people who have tried this accommodation stuff, as George Reed says. There are a lot of people there who have really tried to make integration work in their lives. And given the ongoing public debate across the country about how to integrate, whether to integrate, whether it accomplishes anything worthwhile, I know that one of the things you asked your church members was, do they think it\u0027s worth it? Do they feel hopeful about integration? Do they think it\u0027s worth trying to do, given their experience?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Well, this is Finley Campbell. Like I said earlier, he\u0027s an activist. And he\u0027s been involved in issues in the South and the North. And he has a lot to share here."},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"Integration never has been given a chance to really get off the ground. Remember, we had our last integration bill in \u002765, and then \u002766 the Black Power movement hit on the one end. And then Nixon hit in \u002768 on the other end. And then there is a white-skin privilege and this, that, and the other popped up. So we can no longer talk about a mass integrationist process. It was short-circuited. It was betrayed, to be blunt. So we\u0027ve got to talk about integration moments. And not only have I seen them and experienced them, they fill me with hope."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Now, what do you say to people who think that integration happened, and now we need to move into more segregated, separate kinds of worlds within the country? What do you say to them? Because that seems like a growing movement and commentary that a lot of people who are in the Afro-centric movement are talking about. What do you say about that?"},{"speakerName":"Finley Campbell","text":"Well, I say that many of those people never really experienced true down-home segregation. One of the top Afro-centrist persons, whose name I will not mention, was actually reared in a small town in Minnesota. So of course, with that kind of experience, being the only black, being around very few blacks, you\u0027re going to feel like, my God, let me get as black as I can. But those of us who came up through the old Southern days, with the black churches, black conventions, black schools-- we know what that\u0027s like. And we say, OK, now we\u0027re ready for the next flow."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"Here\u0027s George Reed again."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"I don\u0027t think that there is the sort of commitment in the white community as there was, earlier on, to trying to resolve it. I think maybe many people in the white community are running scared themselves. They want to survive. And whites have grown up in a society that condones bigotry in many respects."},{"speakerName":"George Reed","text":"And even whites who are liberated from that, they still have that baggage that they have to carry, just like blacks have a baggage that they have to carry that says that maybe they aren\u0027t up to it or that they\u0027re not deserving, or that this country doesn\u0027t belong to them like it belongs to everybody else. It\u0027s something that\u0027s so subtle and pervasive that it\u0027s going to take probably, even with the best intentions, a few generations to purge. }}}}}+"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"This next tape is from John Rice. He came to the church, I think, in the \u002770s. So maybe he was hiding out. He was a Black Panther at the time, and a lot {\"? heat on"},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Him. So he came to our church and became involved in the activities there, and has been there ever since. And he said that he found the closest thing to real integration is in our church. In the outside world, he says, there\u0027s a lot of pressure on black people to be primarily identified only as black."},{"speakerName":"John Rice","text":"And I\u0027ve had people from both communities who are-- well, you know you\u0027re black, don\u0027t you? Well, you know you\u0027re black, don\u0027t you? Well, you know you\u0027re a nigger, don\u0027t you? So in that sense, this Unitarian society gave me that freedom. I can be the asshole that I want to be. And nobody says, that\u0027s that black asshole. They just say, that\u0027s John. He\u0027s who he is, right? So I like that freedom."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"One of the things, I think, that\u0027s made people in our church feel as if integration has worked is that people have substantial, authentic relationships with one another. And I think that\u0027s a really big difference, is that it\u0027s been a long haul. George is still there. Betty is still there. Charlotte is still there. All these folks are still around, struggling with these issues. Maybe not talking about them in the same tone, but they\u0027re still part of building a community. And I think the dream is still alive for many people, because of that church. But I think the authenticity of the relationships means that certain things have worked for them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah. Do you want to say something, Laura?"},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"Yeah. And I wanted to say, I think that is what sort of drew me to the church initially. I mean, I came to the church at a point where I thought, I live in two different worlds still, and it\u0027s driving me crazy. I live on the North side, and I grew up on the South side, and I swear to god they\u0027re still two different cities."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"And for me, I needed to reconcile that. And when I came to First Unitarian and I saw that people were still struggling with these issues, I thought, OK, I haven\u0027t lost my mind. People are still struggling with this. And maybe-- George talks about the burden that he felt that he thought that whites didn\u0027t share. And yet I think that in some small way, I feel that burden too, because I don\u0027t want to live in a world where we can only live in harmony if we live separately. It just doesn\u0027t feel right."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, Laura Finnegan and Karen Hutt of the First Unitarian Church here in Chicago, thank you both very much."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"Thank you."},{"speakerName":"Laura Finnegan","text":"Thank you."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"It was fun."},{"speakerName":"Karen Hutt","text":"[MUSIC -- \"STOP THAT ALABAMA BUS\"]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, earlier in our program, we heard a story by Claudia Perez about the year on 26th Street. And we thought that we would end our program with her as well. In reviewing what the year was like in her neighborhood, she also talked about what the year was like in her own life. And she said that her family has actually been pretty sad this year, because a cousin who everybody loved was shot last November, though she didn\u0027t want to talk more about that on the radio."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And this September, she said she had a kind of turning point in her life. She\u0027s 18, and she goes to an alternative high school called El Quarto Ano. And their funding was threatened and they were going to have to close. And her teachers said say she was instrumental in convincing the City College\u0027s Board of Directors to reinstate the funding. She spoke before them, and according to eyewitnesses, she captivated them, the way she spoke. And they did decide to give the money to keep the school open. And to give you a sense of the kind of person who she is becoming now, she decided her school should put out a newspaper, and so she put one out. She wanted to interview Luis Rodriguez, the local poet and author. And she did interview him, which she said for her was a big thing."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And when she and I were going around the discount mall interviewing people for her story, she was constantly giving advice to people, especially to the other teenagers when she would hear their situations. In the leather store, for example, she got into a big discussion with two different women, actually, about how to get college tuition."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Yeah. If you have any good qualifications, like in doing anything, if you could finally get a scholarship, they\u0027ll help you. Anything. They\u0027re helping me try to get a savings bond from this thing called Latin something. And they give you at least $500. But that\u0027s good. Anything will help you. Try to write essays, or poems, anything, and enter them into-- sometimes you\u0027ve got to look for scholarships. And just enter them. And you could get a-- especially because you\u0027re Hispanic. When you go to regular high school, they\u0027re not going to tell you that, because they don\u0027t want you to succeed. That\u0027s the thing. They don\u0027t want you to succeed."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So when she was in our studio, we talked to her about her year. And hold on, let\u0027s get that tape cued up.

Basically down, though."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In what way?"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"My dad\u0027s not here. He wasn\u0027t here for Christmas or Thanksgiving."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Because?"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Personal reasons. Just personal reasons.

Then I finally-- this guy came who I\u0027ve liked for a long time. It\u0027s going to be four years. And I\u0027ve seen him on Christmas Eve. It was good. It was nice, because I haven\u0027t seen him for probably about three months, maybe."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So you\u0027ve liked him for a long time.

And I\u0027ve seen him, and I was happy. I was real happy to have seen him. I thought, oh, good. I got a nice present. To me, that was a good present."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Just to see him."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Yeah. And then two days later, I see him at the mall with another girl. And I guess to me, that was a sign to finally let go. And I wanted to cry, but it was just, like, there\u0027s no more tears left. I\u0027ve learned to take the pain of being let down by him. I still think about him, but when he calls me, I\u0027m not going to jump to it no more. I know it\u0027s not forever."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You\u0027ve been waiting a long time."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"A long time."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How long?"},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Three to four years.

I could have been somewhere else instead of here."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You mean living somewhere else, in another city."},{"speakerName":"Claudia Perez","text":"Mm-hmm.
