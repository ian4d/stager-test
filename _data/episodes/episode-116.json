Come on. Hi, birds. Come on out.","All right, good. Go on outside.","These two roosters are the kinds of birds who are used by the meat industry. As you can see, they\u0027re extremely large, very overweight. They\u0027re crippled. They\u0027re typical.","Well, one is sitting because he can\u0027t get up. And they have skeletal problems.

And he was covered with filth. He eventually became very snowy white. And he was very scared of people. And he was like anybody who\u0027s lived as a creature with no identity in a mass situation. He had no sense of who he was or where he was.","But this changed. After he had been with me and my husband for about three or four months, he became very, very affectionate. He liked to be held. His feathers came in very beautifully. And he became a very sweet, affectionate bird. And he would come when I would call him up the back steps. And he--","Want to demonstrate your sweetness? Do you? This hen has been with us since she was 10 weeks old. Haven\u0027t you been?","They\u0027re very homey birds. That\u0027s another thing is if you brought a chair out here, and you were sitting out here reading a book, or working on something, or you sat out on the steps, they\u0027ll all collect around you. They like to be with you. They like to sit with you. They like to preen themselves next to you. And they\u0027ll sit with you for hours.

And it was just in the typical tradition of let\u0027s make dirty jokes about poultry and do it in a variety of voices. And it\u0027s just a mean-spirited show. It\u0027s very irresponsible, very irresponsible, to present lies, to really just take a collage of hostile attitudes and complacent, smirking voices and put them all together and feel that we\u0027re doing something worthwhile. I understand that the show says something to the effect that this is about America, and this American life, and how we see ourselves. And it\u0027s really about us and not about them. But it\u0027s the birds who get the bad rap.","I remember this woman speaking about the chicken as opera diva, which again, of course, was just a joke, and about Chicken Little being an opera diva. That itself is, again, disparaging. It\u0027s not the worst kind of thing you can do. But the woman\u0027s whole voice, the very tone of her voice, the attitude, the way she talked about chickens, was not in a spirit of goodwill. It\u0027s an ill-willed presentation.","She made some hostile comments about chickens, again, that had no connection to who chickens even are. And maybe she doesn\u0027t even know any chickens herself. She\u0027s just doing what so many people do. She\u0027s just talking off the top of her head.

And I showed up, and I was naked. And I was carrying a machete, and I was blindfolded. And I stood in the middle of this pile of supermarket chickens, the broilers that you buy. And the chicken that I bought was tethered to a three-foot rope around me. And I hacked up and down blindly with a machete.","Well, I was blindfolded, so I didn\u0027t know if it was towards the chicken or not. And I had fully intended that, in fact, I would kill the chicken in the midst of this performance. But chickens aren\u0027t that stupid. And this chicken wanted no part of the machete, stayed at the end of its rope the entire time, apparently.","And after 10 minutes, when I was completely exhausted, I fell to a heap, and everybody left. And the performance was over. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve stuck around after an art performance, but the few minutes after an art performance are some of the most depressing in the world.","You\u0027ve done your wad. You\u0027ve done your bit for art, which has either worked or it hasn\u0027t. But you\u0027re sitting there. You\u0027re covered with chicken effluvia, in my case. It stinks to high hell. Everybody\u0027s gone, and you\u0027ve got to clean up. And you\u0027re naked. It\u0027s really not a pretty picture.","So I get home, and I have this chicken. And I don\u0027t know what to do with it. So I spread out some newspaper on the top of my refrigerator, and I put the chicken up there.","I get a can of Green Giant brand niblets from under the counter. And I open it, and I put it in a little bowl for the chicken. And I give the chicken a little water. And the chicken\u0027s on top of my refrigerator.","That was the available corn. I wish I had thought better of the niblets idea.","Because in fact, if you\u0027re buying three or four cans of niblets a day, which is what the chicken ate, and you\u0027re existing on almost nothing, which I was, then your niblet bill turns out to be some two-figure percentage of your total income each week. If you can imagine living on $50 a week, but $10 of it goes for niblets. It\u0027s just hard to justify an expense like that.","Though at the remove of 15 years, I think I can probably safely admit to you now that one of the reasons that I stuck with the niblets is because I liked saying the word \"niblets\" so much. And this gave me the excuse to use the words like \"niblet\" in general conversation several times a day. Usually, it just doesn\u0027t come up.","And the chicken stayed there, on top of my refrigerator, for a long time, months, six months, I think.","A two room apartment. I had a kitchen and a bedroom. So I didn\u0027t have to look at the chicken when I was sleeping, though I did have to look at it when I was cooking.","Of course I cooked chicken.","No, I felt no particular loyalty to this chicken. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever had chickens, but it\u0027s not like-- you don\u0027t pet chickens. Chickens don\u0027t really like you to pet them. And you don\u0027t hold them. There\u0027s really no love that you feel for a chicken in your life, I don\u0027t think.","I kept the chicken because I couldn\u0027t bear to do anything else. And it\u0027s not like I could have carried it out onto Pico Boulevard and said, \"Be free, little chicken. Be free.\"","I never named the chicken. When I referred to the chicken in public, I always called it \"the hen.\"","The chicken always seemed temporary. It never occurred to me that I might have the chicken as long as six months. The chicken always seemed like something that I would have for just a couple days.","A, I thought about the chicken expiring. B, I have to admit that there was a possibility that someday, I would actually cook the chicken. I went through a lot of chicken recipes, hundreds and hundreds of chicken recipes.","Exactly.","You can\u0027t buy niblet-fed chicken for love or money, I don\u0027t think. I\u0027m not sure that a recipe existed that would have lived up to the fact of the chicken, this animal who you have come to know on fairly intimate terms, and who you have raised, and you have put a certain amount of emotion into.","The chicken did see me naked, damn it.","Exactly. Can I tell you a small story?","A few weeks ago, I was in this Korean restaurant in Koreatown in Los Angeles. It was this place called the Living Fish Center that I\u0027d always wanted to go, because the name of it was so splendid. Living Fish Center, I imagine some sort of vast vivarium where Flipper was jumping through hoops and stuff.","And I go in there, and of course, it\u0027s just a crummy Korean restaurant. It\u0027s not that clean. And there are tanks and stuff, but I didn\u0027t know what to order.","So I order a fish soup because it looks like they have a small fish soup specialty on the menu. And it comes, and it\u0027s just really strong-smelling and not that great. And I try squid fried with bean sauce and onions, which wasn\u0027t that happening.","And I\u0027m about to give up and pay the check and go home with a vast table filled with uneaten stuff. And it suddenly occurs to me what the specialty of the restaurant is. And I wave the waitress over, and I tell her that I\u0027d like a prawn.","And she is puzzled. She didn\u0027t expect me to ask for a prawn. But I repeat my request. And she shrugs and goes and tells the sushi chef.","And he goes to one side of the restaurant. And he climbs on this chair, this ordinary folding chair. And he reaches into this long tank that\u0027s running just below the ceiling. And he wiggles his fingers in the water. When he wiggles the fingers, the prawns just become enraged.","And they start nipping at his fingers, and they start attacking him. And he picks out a couple of the liveliest ones and brings them back to his counter and, without washing his hands, mind you, just makes a few motions over it. And a couple seconds later, the waitress comes over with the prawns on this huge mound of ice.","Now what he\u0027d done is he\u0027d taken off the exoskeleton. The head was intact, and that little part of the tail that is always on prawns was still there. But the middle part is naked, like a grub.","And I picked up the prawn with my chopsticks. And it was not dead, this prawn. It was extremely alive. And it was wiggling its legs. And it was wiggling its antennas.","And its eyes were swiveling madly on its eye stalks. And it was looking back at me, seeing me as actually the predator, the creature that was going to eat it. And that was a really freakish moment, because as much stuff as I eat, and as low as I eat on the food chain, and as many prawns as I have dispatched in my life, I have never before killed a living being with my teeth.","And the prawn knew what I was going to do. And he did not like it. And I wasn\u0027t quite sure what to do, but if I put it down, the prawn would have died anyway. It\u0027s not going to live without its shell. Somebody else would\u0027ve eaten it, blah, blah, blah.","So I bit into it. I bit its body off with my teeth. And the prawn just relaxed in this way that was really eerie.","And the taste of the prawn, the taste of the meat of it, was extraordinary. It was sweet. It was like there was life coursing through it. It was the most alive thing I\u0027ve ever eaten, obviously, literally. But again, it was freaky. It was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption, which is killing a living creature with your teeth.","No. I bit off its body, and I held the head in my hands.","Right. And I thought that I\u0027d killed it. But in fact, when I put it down, it still had so much life in it that it grabbed a piece of salmon sashimi and wouldn\u0027t let go of it. And I don\u0027t think I ever want to do that again.","I think it matters a great deal. One of the greatest metaphors in Western civilization is that of Christ, who gave his life so that others might live. And I don\u0027t want to be sacrilegious, and I don\u0027t want to belittle that myth in any way.","But a pig is giving its life so that we might eat. A chicken is giving its life so that we might eat. And I think the least that we could do is to think about that chicken, to think about that calf that we\u0027re eating. Not necessarily to be sad for it, but to celebrate it, to be aware of the being that it was, that it wasn\u0027t just this bit of bioengineered protein that somehow managed to find its way onto our plates."],"spokenWords":["No, I felt no particular loyalty to this chicken.

Even though he was extremely ill, he decided that he had to go there one last time.","Yeah.","Well, he felt this spiritual connection to these leaders of the past. And he studied the lives, and in particular, how many of these people died, what their last gestures were. And he felt that his last gesture would have to be equally fitting.","Yeah. And while he was there, he decided that he was going to have this amazing last meal. What he did was call back to France and made sure that they had this menu that he decided would be it, which was this amazing feast of oyster, and foie gras, and capon, and finally, this little songbird called ortolan, which symbolizes the French soul. And it was this completely forbidden thing to eat ortolan. It\u0027s illegal in France to do so.","Yeah, and people who have served ortolan, chefs who\u0027ve served it in France, have been fined. And I think in one case, a chef was imprisoned for serving it.","It was the food of kings in France. And once it was caught in these tiny traps, in very old times, they would actually poke the eyes of the bird out. So the bird would live in complete darkness and just eat 24 hours a day. And then when it was fattened, they would drown it in a kind of cognac. And there was this ritual associated with the preparation of the bird, as well as with eating the bird.","Actually, in Proust and Fielding, ortolan appear. And they symbolize seduction, and adultery, and virginity.","Right, people put a large cloth napkin over their head. And apparently, what the napkin does is it keeps the aroma inside this tent in which you\u0027re eating.

And after, literally, months, there was one chef in Bordeaux who said that he would cook the meal.","Yes.","Well, we know that during the meal, he slipped in and out of consciousness in between the courses. And he would eat ravenously, and then he would just sort of pass out. And he sat at a table separate from the table where all his guests were seated. There were about 30 people there, extended family and friends.","And Mitterrand would rise up with each new course and eat. But he really wasn\u0027t talking to many people. And he was really focused on trying to finish the meal and taste, apparently, every note in that meal.","I felt like it was the most incredible meal I\u0027ve eaten. And it was because I was very focused on everything that went into my mouth, and also, because when it came to the ortolan, there\u0027s no easy way to eat ortolan. You are forced to taste every bite. And it goes from being completely sublime to being excruciating.","Yeah, it is. It\u0027s about the size of your thumb. And they serve it in a white cassoulet. And you put the napkin over your head, and you duck down toward the cassoulet. And so you are in this space that is completely white, the white napkin, the white plate, the white cassoulet. And then you have the bird on its back that you lift up and put into your mouth. You cool it by breathing in and out.","Yes. In our case, the chef insisted that we bite off the head and leave the head on the plate. I think in Mitterrand\u0027s case, he ate the head, too.","And then you cool it, and then you begin to chew. And that first bite is incredibly difficult to describe, because it\u0027s terrifying. I was terrified. I was nauseous with the idea of it.","But the first bite of the bird changed that. It was incredibly and almost immediately delicious. And all these juices were flowing out of it into your mouth and mingling and commingling with everything that was already in your mouth. And it\u0027s like this very finely evolved consomme.","And then you begin to taste the meat. And they\u0027re little, tender bits of meat. And then, I think you begin to taste the organs. And it becomes more bitter. So the sweetness and the tenderness turns bitter.","And then, well, you keep chewing ortolan until you have chewed it completely. And then you\u0027re supposed to swallow it all at once. And there\u0027s no other way, really, to consume it. And as you continue to chew, it gets harder and harder, because you\u0027re working the bones, finally.","So the meat and the juices fade. And you suddenly are chewing these bones. And that is when you really, I think, fall into a bit of an existential crisis. Like, what the hell am I doing? And then also, I really think I\u0027m going to throw up.","And how am I going to swallow them? Many people who have never had ortolan before end up spitting it out on the plate. And in fact, at Mitterrand\u0027s last meal, a number of the people in the room did spit out their ortolan.","Yeah, you\u0027re incredibly gauche if you pull that stunt.","Yeah, it definitely changed me. I didn\u0027t eat chicken for a long time.","Because I think I felt guilty.","Yeah, I think it has everything to do with feeling, in some ways, like I had actually eaten the last meal.

Finally, I ate whatever, because I was hungry, without thinking about, for instance, the life that I was putting inside of me.","Yeah, because it takes a lot of energy and concentration. And it takes faith, and all of these things that we don\u0027t associate with eating, when you really taste a meal. It takes concentration and silence. And at the same time, understand how that meal came to your table.","Yeah, I feel like we would age really quickly.","Yeah, it\u0027d be like a time-lapse version of your life, if you were psychically, spiritually, physically, intellectually, erotically present at every meal.","I think we do, to a degree.","I wish it weren\u0027t. But I don\u0027t think we make enough time to eat. And if we haven\u0027t made enough time to eat, then it\u0027s better not to taste what we are eating. It\u0027s easier."],"spokenWords":["Right.

And they symbolize seduction, and adultery, and virginity.","He lived eight days. And he didn\u0027t eat or drink during those days.","Yeah, I feel like we would age really quickly.","Right.","It was the food of kings in France. And once it was caught in these tiny traps, in very old times, they would actually poke the eyes of the bird out. So the bird would live in complete darkness and just eat 24 hours a day. And then when it was fattened, they would drown it in a kind of cognac.

And he studied the lives, and in particular, how many of these people died, what their last gestures were. And he felt that his last gesture would have to be equally fitting.","Right, people put a large cloth napkin over their head.

My brother, sister, and I were members. The meetings took a variety of forms. There were the earnest discussions of Marx and the great labor Zionist thinkers like Theodore Herzl and A. D. Gordon, bull sessions about who in the group had hurt whose feelings, and playing air guitar to \"Come Sail Away\" by Styx. All activities that formed us into pretty deeply committed young socialists, ready at the age of 15 for the ultimate prize the movement could bestow, a summer living and working on a kibbutz, one of the collective farms that were a central part of settling the Jewish state.","There, we would meet other members of the movement from all over the world and spend many a happy hour engaged in honest labor, laughingly baling sheaves of wheat, picking olives, oranges, peaches, grapes, the sweat on our brows a shining reminder of the nobility of collective farming. In the evenings, we would gather together and dance around the fire, sing Crosby, Stills, Nash, \u0026 Young songs and, if one\u0027s older siblings were any indication, lose our virginity. Years later, we would renounce our bourgeois upbringings and return to Israel, making lives of simple, agrarian bliss. This would all change for me in one single evening, in a shed of 5,000 chickens.","The kibbutz I was assigned to was one of the oldest in Israel, settled in 1928 by Jews from Russia, Poland, and Germany. For the most part, our arrival was met with little to no notice. We were just another group of volunteers, no different from the countless other Europeans and Australians just passing through, taking time out to pick fruit, work on their tans, and contract cystitis from their rampant and unchecked coitus. But we were different. We were members of the movement.","I thought that our political ardor would be immediately apparent. I had visions of our bus being greeted by garlanded, folk-dancing youth, so happy to have us there to share in their dream. I had been raised on a fairly steady diet of just such socialist, utopian Ziegfeld numbers, songs, film strips, and oral histories that all attested to just this scenario.","Trees weren\u0027t simply trees. They were jungle gyms of plenty, with smiling children clambering over their branches. A field was somewhere you brought your guitar, so that your comrades could dance down the rows after the day\u0027s work was over.","I was assigned to pick pears. Work would begin at 4:00 AM and finish sometime mid-morning, before the heat had set in. How filled with fervor I was that first morning, the light barely dawning as I headed out in the back of the truck, wearing my simple work shirt, a pair of shorts, and the traditional sun hat worn by so many pioneers who had come before me to make the desert bloom. I should pause here to point out that we actually said things like \"make the desert bloom,\" all the time. So off I headed to the orchard.","I know I sound like the Central Casting New Yorker I\u0027ve turned myself into with single-minded determination when I say this, but the main problem with working in the fields is that the sun is just always shining. Dyed-in-the-wool Northerner that I am, it became apparent after about two days that I was completely unsuited to working outside. And I was moved around among the kibbutz\u0027s various interior jobs, the furniture factory, the metal irrigation parts factory, and the kitchen, assured all the while by the group leader that there was nothing emasculating or ersatz socialist in being moved inside. After all, each according to his needs, each according to his abilities. My abilities seemed to lie in passing out from heat stroke after a scant two hours in an orchard.","This continued for weeks. It was a somewhat idyllic, if not a mite monotonous existence, that is, until the long night of the chickens. The boys of our group were gathered together one day and told in the hushed tones reserved for trying to avert impending disaster that we would forgo our regular work details and spend the night from midnight until dawn packing truckloads of poultry.","Why this needed to be done with such urgent secrecy under cover of night and why the girls were excused was never explained to us. And we didn\u0027t ask. We greeted the news with the respectful Hemingway silence of the Y chromosome, no dopey girls allowed. It was all imbued with nocturnal, testicular melodrama, like some summer stock production of Das Boot.","We slept that evening from 9:00 to 11:00, what I would come to know later, in a far different context, as a disco nap. We rose, drank some tea. The girls sprayed perfume into some handkerchiefs for us to wear around our noses and mouths. And we were off in trucks to do battle with the insurgent chickens. The scene had everything but the diner waitress standing in the road watching us go, worriedly wiping her hands on her gingham apron.","The chicken coop of the kibbutz was a one-storied structure of corrugated iron, about half the size of a football field. It emitted a low rumbling, a vague buzz that you could hear from far away. And of course from even farther away, there was the smell, a smell of such head-kicking intensity as to make a perfume-sprayed handkerchief almost adorable in its valiant naivete, Wile E. Coyote warding off a falling boulder with his paper parasol. And the combination of floral scent and dung merely increased the vileness.","Chicken [BLEEP] is horrible stuff. Unlike cow manure, which according to David Foster Wallace, smells \"warm and herbal and blameless,\" chicken [BLEEP] is an olfactory insult, a snarling, saw-toothed, ammoniac, cheesy smell, needlessly, gratuitously disgusting, a stench of such assaultive tenacity that it burns your eyes. Rather than making you never want to eat a chicken again, it simply makes you angry. It makes you hold a grudge. You\u0027ll eat chicken again, by god, and you\u0027ll chew really, really hard.","One of the barrel-chested Israelis shows us what to do. Pick up four chickens in each hand. This is done by grabbing hold of the birds by one leg. \"If the leg snaps,\" he says, \"it doesn\u0027t matter, just to get four in each hand. B\u0027seder?\" he says. OK?","He faces us, holding the requisite eight, four in each hand, living masses of writhing feathers. He looks like some German expressionist cheerleader, his pom-poms alive, convulsing, filthy. \"Who will see their dreams fall away into the abyss and eventually succumb to the crushing sadness and meaninglessness of it all? We will. And what does that spell? Madness. Louder. I can\u0027t hear you.\"","He crams the chickens roughly into a blue plastic crate smeared with wet guano. \"And you close the lid, and tchick tchack,\" he tells us, clapping his hands with \"that\u0027s that\" finality. Before I even try, I know that I will not be able to do this. It is midnight, and we will be here until dawn, or until the truck is piled to capacity with crated birds.","I walk out into the sea of chickens. I reach down and grab one, its leg a slightly thicker, segmented chopstick. I recoil and stand up. I take a fetid breath, regroup, and bend down with new resolve, grab the chicken by its body with both hands, thinking somehow that might be preferable. Although how I think I\u0027m going to get eight of them this way, I\u0027m not sure. Its ribs expand and contract under my fingers, a dirty, warm, live umbrella. I drop the bird as if it were boiling hot.","I leave the coop and go out to the trucks. Hoisting myself up onto the flatbed, I start to help with the stacking of the full crates. I know that my unilateral decision to change my task is met with displeasure on the part of the men who run the coop, but I do not care. Their muttered comments are predicated on a direct poultry-penile relationship. I might as well have spurned the stag party whore or gone to the woodshop and fashioned myself a sign that said \"fag.\" \"Ma ito? What\u0027s the matter with him,\" the head of the work detail asks when he sees me on the truck.","[SPEAKING HEBREW], he is answered, using the female pronoun when referring to me. \"The lady doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\"","It would be years before I was referred to as \"she\" again, and then very rarely and only as a joke by friends. I turn around to look at the man, making it quite clear to him that I understand what they are saying. The man who called me \"she\" avoids my eyes and busies himself with straightening a pile of crates and tightening the tarpaulin on the side of the truck. \"You\u0027re right,\" I tell him in Hebrew. \"She doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\"","Have you ever had one of those moments when you know that you are being visited by your own future? They come so rarely and with so little fanfare, those moments. They\u0027re not particularly photogenic. There\u0027s no breach in the clouds to reveal the shining city on a hill, no folk-dancing children outside your bus, no production values to speak of, just a glimpse of such quotidian, incontrovertible truth that after the initial shock at the supreme weirdness of it all, a kind of calm sets in. So this is to be my life.","At that very moment, I saw that I would never live on a kibbutz. I would not lose my virginity that summer to any of the girls from the group. Indeed, I would not care to do so. I am grateful to that macho blowhard. He made me consciously realize what I had always known but been somehow unable to say to myself. He\u0027s right. I don\u0027t like chickens. I like men.","Now, I live in Manhattan, the un-kibbutz, where nobody would dream of touching a live chicken, where whatever spirit of collectivist altruism people might have had dried up long ago. At camp, when I was young, I and the other children of affluent professionals would gather under the trees every day to sing before going into lunch. One of the songs was always \"The Internationale,\" the hymn of the proletariat. One summer, we were even taught to sing it with our left fists raised.","We were, none of us, by any stretch of the imagination, what could be described as prisoners of starvation, wretched of the earth, or enthralled slaves. Admittedly, they are all catchier metaphors and easier to scan than, \"Arise, ye children of psychiatrists,\" but they had little to nothing to do with us personally. And yet, for those few moments when we were singing, those words seemed so true. How can I describe to you that 11-year-old\u0027s sense of purpose, that thrill of belonging to something larger, something outside of my own body, the sheer heart-stopping beauty of a world of justice and perfection rising on new foundations. And that one line, \"We have been naught. We shall be all.\"","Naught. It spoke as much about my wish to be delivered from this pre-adolescent self-loathing as it did to any consciousness of liberating the masses. But it held such promise of what I might hope for that even now, as I write this, I can still call up that old fervor. It still makes my breath catch in my throat."],"spokenWords":["Friday nights of my childhood and early adolescence were spent at weekly meetings of a socialist, Zionist, youth movement.

But it held such promise of what I might hope for that even now, as I write this, I can still call up that old fervor. It still makes my breath catch in my throat.","The kibbutz I was assigned to was one of the oldest in Israel, settled in 1928 by Jews from Russia, Poland, and Germany. For the most part, our arrival was met with little to no notice. We were just another group of volunteers, no different from the countless other Europeans and Australians just passing through, taking time out to pick fruit, work on their tans, and contract cystitis from their rampant and unchecked coitus. But we were different. We were members of the movement.","I know I sound like the Central Casting New Yorker I\u0027ve turned myself into with single-minded determination when I say this, but the main problem with working in the fields is that the sun is just always shining. Dyed-in-the-wool Northerner that I am, it became apparent after about two days that I was completely unsuited to working outside. And I was moved around among the kibbutz\u0027s various interior jobs, the furniture factory, the metal irrigation parts factory, and the kitchen, assured all the while by the group leader that there was nothing emasculating or ersatz socialist in being moved inside. After all, each according to his needs, each according to his abilities. My abilities seemed to lie in passing out from heat stroke after a scant two hours in an orchard.","[SPEAKING HEBREW], he is answered, using the female pronoun when referring to me. \"The lady doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\"","Now, I live in Manhattan, the un-kibbutz, where nobody would dream of touching a live chicken, where whatever spirit of collectivist altruism people might have had dried up long ago. At camp, when I was young, I and the other children of affluent professionals would gather under the trees every day to sing before going into lunch. One of the songs was always \"The Internationale,\" the hymn of the proletariat. One summer, we were even taught to sing it with our left fists raised.","There, we would meet other members of the movement from all over the world and spend many a happy hour engaged in honest labor, laughingly baling sheaves of wheat, picking olives, oranges, peaches, grapes, the sweat on our brows a shining reminder of the nobility of collective farming. In the evenings, we would gather together and dance around the fire, sing Crosby, Stills, Nash, \u0026 Young songs and, if one\u0027s older siblings were any indication, lose our virginity. Years later, we would renounce our bourgeois upbringings and return to Israel, making lives of simple, agrarian bliss. This would all change for me in one single evening, in a shed of 5,000 chickens.","I thought that our political ardor would be immediately apparent. I had visions of our bus being greeted by garlanded, folk-dancing youth, so happy to have us there to share in their dream. I had been raised on a fairly steady diet of just such socialist, utopian Ziegfeld numbers, songs, film strips, and oral histories that all attested to just this scenario.","It would be years before I was referred to as \"she\" again, and then very rarely and only as a joke by friends. I turn around to look at the man, making it quite clear to him that I understand what they are saying. The man who called me \"she\" avoids my eyes and busies himself with straightening a pile of crates and tightening the tarpaulin on the side of the truck. \"You\u0027re right,\" I tell him in Hebrew. \"She doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\"","The chicken coop of the kibbutz was a one-storied structure of corrugated iron, about half the size of a football field. It emitted a low rumbling, a vague buzz that you could hear from far away. And of course from even farther away, there was the smell, a smell of such head-kicking intensity as to make a perfume-sprayed handkerchief almost adorable in its valiant naivete, Wile E. Coyote warding off a falling boulder with his paper parasol. And the combination of floral scent and dung merely increased the vileness.","At that very moment, I saw that I would never live on a kibbutz. I would not lose my virginity that summer to any of the girls from the group. Indeed, I would not care to do so. I am grateful to that macho blowhard. He made me consciously realize what I had always known but been somehow unable to say to myself. He\u0027s right. I don\u0027t like chickens. I like men.","One of the barrel-chested Israelis shows us what to do. Pick up four chickens in each hand. This is done by grabbing hold of the birds by one leg. \"If the leg snaps,\" he says, \"it doesn\u0027t matter, just to get four in each hand. B\u0027seder?\" he says. OK?","I walk out into the sea of chickens. I reach down and grab one, its leg a slightly thicker, segmented chopstick. I recoil and stand up. I take a fetid breath, regroup, and bend down with new resolve, grab the chicken by its body with both hands, thinking somehow that might be preferable. Although how I think I\u0027m going to get eight of them this way, I\u0027m not sure. Its ribs expand and contract under my fingers, a dirty, warm, live umbrella. I drop the bird as if it were boiling hot.","Chicken [BLEEP] is horrible stuff. Unlike cow manure, which according to David Foster Wallace, smells \"warm and herbal and blameless,\" chicken [BLEEP] is an olfactory insult, a snarling, saw-toothed, ammoniac, cheesy smell, needlessly, gratuitously disgusting, a stench of such assaultive tenacity that it burns your eyes. Rather than making you never want to eat a chicken again, it simply makes you angry. It makes you hold a grudge. You\u0027ll eat chicken again, by god, and you\u0027ll chew really, really hard.","Have you ever had one of those moments when you know that you are being visited by your own future? They come so rarely and with so little fanfare, those moments. They\u0027re not particularly photogenic. There\u0027s no breach in the clouds to reveal the shining city on a hill, no folk-dancing children outside your bus, no production values to speak of, just a glimpse of such quotidian, incontrovertible truth that after the initial shock at the supreme weirdness of it all, a kind of calm sets in. So this is to be my life.","This continued for weeks. It was a somewhat idyllic, if not a mite monotonous existence, that is, until the long night of the chickens. The boys of our group were gathered together one day and told in the hushed tones reserved for trying to avert impending disaster that we would forgo our regular work details and spend the night from midnight until dawn packing truckloads of poultry.","We slept that evening from 9:00 to 11:00, what I would come to know later, in a far different context, as a disco nap. We rose, drank some tea. The girls sprayed perfume into some handkerchiefs for us to wear around our noses and mouths. And we were off in trucks to do battle with the insurgent chickens. The scene had everything but the diner waitress standing in the road watching us go, worriedly wiping her hands on her gingham apron.","We were, none of us, by any stretch of the imagination, what could be described as prisoners of starvation, wretched of the earth, or enthralled slaves. Admittedly, they are all catchier metaphors and easier to scan than, \"Arise, ye children of psychiatrists,\" but they had little to nothing to do with us personally. And yet, for those few moments when we were singing, those words seemed so true. How can I describe to you that 11-year-old\u0027s sense of purpose, that thrill of belonging to something larger, something outside of my own body, the sheer heart-stopping beauty of a world of justice and perfection rising on new foundations. And that one line, \"We have been naught. We shall be all.\"","Trees weren\u0027t simply trees. They were jungle gyms of plenty, with smiling children clambering over their branches. A field was somewhere you brought your guitar, so that your comrades could dance down the rows after the day\u0027s work was over.","I leave the coop and go out to the trucks. Hoisting myself up onto the flatbed, I start to help with the stacking of the full crates. I know that my unilateral decision to change my task is met with displeasure on the part of the men who run the coop, but I do not care. Their muttered comments are predicated on a direct poultry-penile relationship. I might as well have spurned the stag party whore or gone to the woodshop and fashioned myself a sign that said \"fag.\" \"Ma ito? What\u0027s the matter with him,\" the head of the work detail asks when he sees me on the truck.","He crams the chickens roughly into a blue plastic crate smeared with wet guano. \"And you close the lid, and tchick tchack,\" he tells us, clapping his hands with \"that\u0027s that\" finality. Before I even try, I know that I will not be able to do this. It is midnight, and we will be here until dawn, or until the truck is piled to capacity with crated birds."]},"Elizabeth Meister":{"name":"Elizabeth Meister","episodes":{"116":"Poultry Slam 1998"},"statements":["So do your friends think it\u0027s weird?

And I showed up, and I was naked. And I was carrying a machete, and I was blindfolded. And I stood in the middle of this pile of supermarket chickens, the broilers that you buy. And the chicken that I bought was tethered to a three-foot rope around me. And I hacked up and down blindly with a machete.","Well, I was blindfolded, so I didn\u0027t know if it was towards the chicken or not. And I had fully intended that, in fact, I would kill the chicken in the midst of this performance. But chickens aren\u0027t that stupid. And this chicken wanted no part of the machete, stayed at the end of its rope the entire time, apparently.","And after 10 minutes, when I was completely exhausted, I fell to a heap, and everybody left. And the performance was over. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve stuck around after an art performance, but the few minutes after an art performance are some of the most depressing in the world.","You\u0027ve done your wad. You\u0027ve done your bit for art, which has either worked or it hasn\u0027t. But you\u0027re sitting there. You\u0027re covered with chicken effluvia, in my case. It stinks to high hell. Everybody\u0027s gone, and you\u0027ve got to clean up. And you\u0027re naked. It\u0027s really not a pretty picture.","So I get home, and I have this chicken. And I don\u0027t know what to do with it. So I spread out some newspaper on the top of my refrigerator, and I put the chicken up there.","I get a can of Green Giant brand niblets from under the counter. And I open it, and I put it in a little bowl for the chicken. And I give the chicken a little water. And the chicken\u0027s on top of my refrigerator.","That was the available corn. I wish I had thought better of the niblets idea.","Because in fact, if you\u0027re buying three or four cans of niblets a day, which is what the chicken ate, and you\u0027re existing on almost nothing, which I was, then your niblet bill turns out to be some two-figure percentage of your total income each week. If you can imagine living on $50 a week, but $10 of it goes for niblets. It\u0027s just hard to justify an expense like that.","Though at the remove of 15 years, I think I can probably safely admit to you now that one of the reasons that I stuck with the niblets is because I liked saying the word \"niblets\" so much. And this gave me the excuse to use the words like \"niblet\" in general conversation several times a day. Usually, it just doesn\u0027t come up.","And the chicken stayed there, on top of my refrigerator, for a long time, months, six months, I think.","A two room apartment. I had a kitchen and a bedroom. So I didn\u0027t have to look at the chicken when I was sleeping, though I did have to look at it when I was cooking.","Of course I cooked chicken.","No, I felt no particular loyalty to this chicken. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever had chickens, but it\u0027s not like-- you don\u0027t pet chickens. Chickens don\u0027t really like you to pet them. And you don\u0027t hold them. There\u0027s really no love that you feel for a chicken in your life, I don\u0027t think.","I kept the chicken because I couldn\u0027t bear to do anything else. And it\u0027s not like I could have carried it out onto Pico Boulevard and said, \"Be free, little chicken. Be free.\"","I never named the chicken. When I referred to the chicken in public, I always called it \"the hen.\"","The chicken always seemed temporary. It never occurred to me that I might have the chicken as long as six months. The chicken always seemed like something that I would have for just a couple days.","A, I thought about the chicken expiring. B, I have to admit that there was a possibility that someday, I would actually cook the chicken. I went through a lot of chicken recipes, hundreds and hundreds of chicken recipes.","Exactly.","You can\u0027t buy niblet-fed chicken for love or money, I don\u0027t think. I\u0027m not sure that a recipe existed that would have lived up to the fact of the chicken, this animal who you have come to know on fairly intimate terms, and who you have raised, and you have put a certain amount of emotion into.","The chicken did see me naked, damn it.","Exactly. Can I tell you a small story?","A few weeks ago, I was in this Korean restaurant in Koreatown in Los Angeles.

And a couple seconds later, the waitress comes over with the prawns on this huge mound of ice."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Now what he\u0027d done is he\u0027d taken off the exoskeleton. The head was intact, and that little part of the tail that is always on prawns was still there. But the middle part is naked, like a grub."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And I picked up the prawn with my chopsticks. And it was not dead, this prawn. It was extremely alive. And it was wiggling its legs. And it was wiggling its antennas."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And its eyes were swiveling madly on its eye stalks. And it was looking back at me, seeing me as actually the predator, the creature that was going to eat it. And that was a really freakish moment, because as much stuff as I eat, and as low as I eat on the food chain, and as many prawns as I have dispatched in my life, I have never before killed a living being with my teeth."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And the prawn knew what I was going to do. And he did not like it. And I wasn\u0027t quite sure what to do, but if I put it down, the prawn would have died anyway. It\u0027s not going to live without its shell. Somebody else would\u0027ve eaten it, blah, blah, blah."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"So I bit into it. I bit its body off with my teeth. And the prawn just relaxed in this way that was really eerie."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And the taste of the prawn, the taste of the meat of it, was extraordinary. It was sweet. It was like there was life coursing through it. It was the most alive thing I\u0027ve ever eaten, obviously, literally. But again, it was freaky. It was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption, which is killing a living creature with your teeth."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you bit into the prawn, did you actually bite off its head, its living head, and have its head and its eyes in your mouth?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"No. I bit off its body, and I held the head in my hands."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So you held the head in one hand and the tail in the other, and you bit the center."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Right. And I thought that I\u0027d killed it. But in fact, when I put it down, it still had so much life in it that it grabbed a piece of salmon sashimi and wouldn\u0027t let go of it. And I don\u0027t think I ever want to do that again."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you feel like there was something about the experience that made it more-- this word is a little cornier than I intend, but it\u0027s the only word that I can think of-- sacred, that took it out of the mundaneness of the way that we eat, which for most of us is eating without actually tasting and experiencing and thinking about what we\u0027re eating and what on the earth it is that we\u0027re killing to survive? Do you think in some way that it\u0027s more acceptable to eat an animal if you are more awake to the fact that it is an animal and what\u0027s happened to it? Or do you think it really doesn\u0027t matter?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"I think it matters a great deal. One of the greatest metaphors in Western civilization is that of Christ, who gave his life so that others might live. And I don\u0027t want to be sacrilegious, and I don\u0027t want to belittle that myth in any way."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"But a pig is giving its life so that we might eat. A chicken is giving its life so that we might eat. And I think the least that we could do is to think about that chicken, to think about that calf that we\u0027re eating. Not necessarily to be sad for it, but to celebrate it, to be aware of the being that it was, that it wasn\u0027t just this bit of bioengineered protein that somehow managed to find its way onto our plates."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Jonathan Gold writes his food column, \"Counter Intelligence,\" for the LA Weekly.

And he studied the lives, and in particular, how many of these people died, what their last gestures were. And he felt that his last gesture would have to be equally fitting.","Yeah. And while he was there, he decided that he was going to have this amazing last meal. What he did was call back to France and made sure that they had this menu that he decided would be it, which was this amazing feast of oyster, and foie gras, and capon, and finally, this little songbird called ortolan, which symbolizes the French soul. And it was this completely forbidden thing to eat ortolan. It\u0027s illegal in France to do so.","Yeah, and people who have served ortolan, chefs who\u0027ve served it in France, have been fined. And I think in one case, a chef was imprisoned for serving it.","It was the food of kings in France. And once it was caught in these tiny traps, in very old times, they would actually poke the eyes of the bird out. So the bird would live in complete darkness and just eat 24 hours a day.

And there was this ritual associated with the preparation of the bird, as well as with eating the bird.","Actually, in Proust and Fielding, ortolan appear.

And apparently, what the napkin does is it keeps the aroma inside this tent in which you\u0027re eating.

And it started with 100 phone calls just to try to locate somebody who would even entertain the notion. And after, literally, months, there was one chef in Bordeaux who said that he would cook the meal.","Yes.","Well, we know that during the meal, he slipped in and out of consciousness in between the courses.

And he was really focused on trying to finish the meal and taste, apparently, every note in that meal.","I felt like it was the most incredible meal I\u0027ve eaten. And it was because I was very focused on everything that went into my mouth, and also, because when it came to the ortolan, there\u0027s no easy way to eat ortolan. You are forced to taste every bite. And it goes from being completely sublime to being excruciating.","Yeah, it is. It\u0027s about the size of your thumb. And they serve it in a white cassoulet.

And then you have the bird on its back that you lift up and put into your mouth. You cool it by breathing in and out.","Yes. In our case, the chef insisted that we bite off the head and leave the head on the plate. I think in Mitterrand\u0027s case, he ate the head, too.","And then you cool it, and then you begin to chew. And that first bite is incredibly difficult to describe, because it\u0027s terrifying. I was terrified. I was nauseous with the idea of it.","But the first bite of the bird changed that. It was incredibly and almost immediately delicious. And all these juices were flowing out of it into your mouth and mingling and commingling with everything that was already in your mouth. And it\u0027s like this very finely evolved consomme.","And then you begin to taste the meat. And they\u0027re little, tender bits of meat. And then, I think you begin to taste the organs. And it becomes more bitter. So the sweetness and the tenderness turns bitter.","And then, well, you keep chewing ortolan until you have chewed it completely. And then you\u0027re supposed to swallow it all at once. And there\u0027s no other way, really, to consume it. And as you continue to chew, it gets harder and harder, because you\u0027re working the bones, finally.","So the meat and the juices fade. And you suddenly are chewing these bones. And that is when you really, I think, fall into a bit of an existential crisis. Like, what the hell am I doing? And then also, I really think I\u0027m going to throw up.","And how am I going to swallow them? Many people who have never had ortolan before end up spitting it out on the plate. And in fact, at Mitterrand\u0027s last meal, a number of the people in the room did spit out their ortolan.","Yeah, you\u0027re incredibly gauche if you pull that stunt.","Yeah, it definitely changed me. I didn\u0027t eat chicken for a long time.","Because I think I felt guilty.","Yeah, I think it has everything to do with feeling, in some ways, like I had actually eaten the last meal.

In our case, the chef insisted that we bite off the head and leave the head on the plate. I think in Mitterrand\u0027s case, he ate the head, too."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"OK. So you bite off the head. You leave the head on the plate."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And then you cool it, and then you begin to chew. And that first bite is incredibly difficult to describe, because it\u0027s terrifying. I was terrified. I was nauseous with the idea of it."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"But the first bite of the bird changed that. It was incredibly and almost immediately delicious. And all these juices were flowing out of it into your mouth and mingling and commingling with everything that was already in your mouth. And it\u0027s like this very finely evolved consomme."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And then you begin to taste the meat. And they\u0027re little, tender bits of meat. And then, I think you begin to taste the organs. And it becomes more bitter. So the sweetness and the tenderness turns bitter."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And then, well, you keep chewing ortolan until you have chewed it completely. And then you\u0027re supposed to swallow it all at once. And there\u0027s no other way, really, to consume it. And as you continue to chew, it gets harder and harder, because you\u0027re working the bones, finally."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"So the meat and the juices fade. And you suddenly are chewing these bones. And that is when you really, I think, fall into a bit of an existential crisis. Like, what the hell am I doing? And then also, I really think I\u0027m going to throw up."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And how am I going to swallow these bones?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And how am I going to swallow them? Many people who have never had ortolan before end up spitting it out on the plate. And in fact, at Mitterrand\u0027s last meal, a number of the people in the room did spit out their ortolan."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That seems like incredibly bad form, though. You\u0027re spitting out the soul of France."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, you\u0027re incredibly gauche if you pull that stunt."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did this experience change you?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, it definitely changed me. I didn\u0027t eat chicken for a long time."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Why?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Because I think I felt guilty."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Guilty like you didn\u0027t feel like it was right to eat a bird without the sacred quality that it had to eat the ortolan?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, I think it has everything to do with feeling, in some ways, like I had actually eaten the last meal. And for me to put anything else inside of my body would mean that it would have to be somehow as sacred, or holy, or as good. And it\u0027s not like I am suddenly a vegetarian now. Finally, I ate whatever, because I was hungry, without thinking about, for instance, the life that I was putting inside of me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Was it a relief not to taste the food again?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, because it takes a lot of energy and concentration. And it takes faith, and all of these things that we don\u0027t associate with eating, when you really taste a meal. It takes concentration and silence. And at the same time, understand how that meal came to your table."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The way you describe it, it\u0027s almost like you\u0027re saying that if we were really awake to what the world is giving us in a given meal, it would be hard eat the meal every single time."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, I feel like we would age really quickly."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you think we would age because we\u0027d be doing so much thinking and so much mental work during the meal?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, it\u0027d be like a time-lapse version of your life, if you were psychically, spiritually, physically, intellectually, erotically present at every meal."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But you\u0027re saying that we have to deaden ourselves in order to live."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"I think we do, to a degree."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But I think-- I have to say, what\u0027s radical about what you\u0027re saying is you\u0027re saying, maybe that isn\u0027t such a horrible thing. Maybe that actually has to be the way."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"I wish it weren\u0027t. But I don\u0027t think we make enough time to eat. And if we haven\u0027t made enough time to eat, then it\u0027s better not to taste what we are eating. It\u0027s easier."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Michael Paterniti in Portland, Maine. Coming up, a woman who thinks that This American Life is bad for an entire species, and when a perfumed handkerchief does not do what you want it to do.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of stories on that theme. Today, during the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the time of year when poultry consumption is at its greatest in this country, we bring you our annual Poultry Slam, stories of chickens, turkeys, ducks, fowl of all kind, and our relationship with them. We have come to act three of our program, Act Three, People who Love Birds and Hate This American Life.","Well, I hold in my hand a stack of, I\u0027d say that it\u0027s about 50 letters that I\u0027ve received from around the country. Here is one from Yonkers, New York.

It begins, \"Dear Mr. Glass, we were profoundly shocked to learn that for two years in a row, during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, you have produced a Poultry Slam program--\"","The wording is identical in these. In fact, the wording is identical in most of the letters. The first wave of mail was organized by a woman named Karen Davis, head and founder of a group called United Poultry Concerns. We invited her onto the program to correct whatever misinformation she thought we were spreading. She, in turn, invited me out to her home, out in poultry country in eastern Virginia.","Every morning, Karen lets 55 birds out of the converted garage behind her house. They stay in there overnight as protection against predators.","It\u0027s a lovely, friendly chaos, like a scene from Dr. Doolittle.","[ROOSTER CROWING]","Nearly all of these birds are refugees from the commercial poultry industry. Karen started taking care of birds that had fallen out of trucks, or had been left behind, or escaped. She let animal shelters know that she would care for chickens. People started bringing her birds. She gets birds from school hatching projects. And now, she\u0027s got a big, fenced-in back yard full of them.","When you say crippled, how are they crippled?","In nature, it takes a chicken six months to grow to full maturity. But with selective breeding and specially formulated feed, the poultry industry now raises a bird to full size in just six weeks. Then they\u0027re butchered.","What Karen Davis is doing is keeping birds alive that are not designed to live very long. Putting on all this extra weight so fast, so young, strains the heart and lungs, she says. And typically, their bodies give out when they\u0027re just two years old. That\u0027s versus traditional breeds, which can live 10, 15 years.","And what she finds when she cares for these birds in a loving way, outside the crowded chicken houses they were born into, is that they defy the stereotypes that most people have about chickens. They\u0027re not stupid, or dirty, or cold-hearted. Take Henry, one of the first birds Karen brought home.","Here\u0027s one area where Karen Davis is completely in the right, and I and my radio staff have been absolutely wrong. In our earlier Poultry Slams, three or four times, people referred to chickens as stupid, as having no personality. In last year\u0027s show, at one point, I myself declared that if chickens had a personality, that personality seemed to be that they\u0027re a pain in the ass. And while this may be true for the chickens I observed, which were raised in the crowded gulag of commercial production, chickens raised properly, well, they can be kind of sweet.","Karen showed me Ella, who likes her neck stroked. And Elise, who jumps over the fence every morning and jumps back in every night. And Lois and Lambrusco, a pair who stick together all the time. And Dolores, who\u0027s sort of shy. She says meat-eaters like me usually don\u0027t like to think that chickens have personalities, because then it would be too hard to eat them.","We hung around the yard for half an hour and then went inside. She made a pot of coffee. And when we got to discussing This American Life, I have to say the mood got a good bit chillier. Karen Davis sees our annual Poultry Slam as one long piece of insensitive, anti-chicken propaganda.","If you\u0027ve heard much of today\u0027s program at all, if you didn\u0027t just turn on your radio a moment or two ago, then you got a pretty good sense of the tone of our previous Poultry Slams. And even stories that actually tried to document cruelty to poultry, for instance one woman\u0027s rather grim memoir of growing up on a turkey farm, even this, Karen found offensive in tone and in spirit.","I pointed out that half the stories in previous years had not even been about real chickens. One was about a duck hand puppet. One was about a radio superhero called Chicken Man. One was an opera about Chicken Little, staged entirely with finger puppets.","[MUSIC PLAYING FROM \"LA PULCINA PICCOLA\"]","I just have to differ with you.

After he had been with me and my husband for about three or four months, he became very, very affectionate. He liked to be held. His feathers came in very beautifully.

And he--"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Here\u0027s one area where Karen Davis is completely in the right, and I and my radio staff have been absolutely wrong. In our earlier Poultry Slams, three or four times, people referred to chickens as stupid, as having no personality. In last year\u0027s show, at one point, I myself declared that if chickens had a personality, that personality seemed to be that they\u0027re a pain in the ass. And while this may be true for the chickens I observed, which were raised in the crowded gulag of commercial production, chickens raised properly, well, they can be kind of sweet."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"Want to demonstrate your sweetness? Do you? This hen has been with us since she was 10 weeks old. Haven\u0027t you been?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Karen showed me Ella, who likes her neck stroked. And Elise, who jumps over the fence every morning and jumps back in every night. And Lois and Lambrusco, a pair who stick together all the time. And Dolores, who\u0027s sort of shy. She says meat-eaters like me usually don\u0027t like to think that chickens have personalities, because then it would be too hard to eat them."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"They\u0027re very homey birds. That\u0027s another thing is if you brought a chair out here, and you were sitting out here reading a book, or working on something, or you sat out on the steps, they\u0027ll all collect around you. They like to be with you. They like to sit with you. They like to preen themselves next to you. And they\u0027ll sit with you for hours. That was one of the first things that drew me to them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We hung around the yard for half an hour and then went inside. She made a pot of coffee. And when we got to discussing This American Life, I have to say the mood got a good bit chillier. Karen Davis sees our annual Poultry Slam as one long piece of insensitive, anti-chicken propaganda."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"I thought it was a disgusting show. And it was just in the typical tradition of let\u0027s make dirty jokes about poultry and do it in a variety of voices. And it\u0027s just a mean-spirited show. It\u0027s very irresponsible, very irresponsible, to present lies, to really just take a collage of hostile attitudes and complacent, smirking voices and put them all together and feel that we\u0027re doing something worthwhile. I understand that the show says something to the effect that this is about America, and this American life, and how we see ourselves. And it\u0027s really about us and not about them. But it\u0027s the birds who get the bad rap."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"If you\u0027ve heard much of today\u0027s program at all, if you didn\u0027t just turn on your radio a moment or two ago, then you got a pretty good sense of the tone of our previous Poultry Slams. And even stories that actually tried to document cruelty to poultry, for instance one woman\u0027s rather grim memoir of growing up on a turkey farm, even this, Karen found offensive in tone and in spirit."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I pointed out that half the stories in previous years had not even been about real chickens. One was about a duck hand puppet. One was about a radio superhero called Chicken Man. One was an opera about Chicken Little, staged entirely with finger puppets."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC PLAYING FROM \"LA PULCINA PICCOLA\"]"},{"text":"But Karen would have none of it."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"I remember this woman speaking about the chicken as opera diva, which again, of course, was just a joke, and about Chicken Little being an opera diva. That itself is, again, disparaging. It\u0027s not the worst kind of thing you can do. But the woman\u0027s whole voice, the very tone of her voice, the attitude, the way she talked about chickens, was not in a spirit of goodwill. It\u0027s an ill-willed presentation."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I just have to differ with you. When I think about the woman in that story, she\u0027s very affectionate towards the characters in her opera."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"She made some hostile comments about chickens, again, that had no connection to who chickens even are. And maybe she doesn\u0027t even know any chickens herself. She\u0027s just doing what so many people do. She\u0027s just talking off the top of her head. And chickens are easy to, again, make into characters who you can laugh and smirk over."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But I guess I\u0027m saying, she\u0027s not laughing and smirking. She loves her chicken characters, like all the birds in the thing. She clearly loves them."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"She said something to the effect on that show that chickens had no personalities and didn\u0027t know who they were. I don\u0027t remember exactly what it was. But it was one of those kinds of statements."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But that was just one moment in a story that, in a certain way, had less to do with chickens and much more to do with what it means to create something emotional and grand out of something so small as finger puppets. Karen Davis and I argued for a long time about whether there was anything in our program at all, besides slander against chickens. And in the end, we simply do not agree. I asked her why, if there\u0027s this genocide of millions of chickens a day, with ads on television encouraging people to tear at chickens\u0027 flesh with their teeth, ads that reach many more people than we do on our radio show, why go after us?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you feel like somehow by stopping us, that that\u0027s going to change the situation for chickens, that that\u0027s going to have an impact on the number of birds killed and mistreated?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"It could. You\u0027re part of the problem. As long as you do this show called a Poultry Slam, you\u0027re part of the problem. You\u0027re one of the reasons. You\u0027re one of the many components of the abuse.

My brother, sister, and I were members. The meetings took a variety of forms. There were the earnest discussions of Marx and the great labor Zionist thinkers like Theodore Herzl and A. D. Gordon, bull sessions about who in the group had hurt whose feelings, and playing air guitar to \"Come Sail Away\" by Styx. All activities that formed us into pretty deeply committed young socialists, ready at the age of 15 for the ultimate prize the movement could bestow, a summer living and working on a kibbutz, one of the collective farms that were a central part of settling the Jewish state.","There, we would meet other members of the movement from all over the world and spend many a happy hour engaged in honest labor, laughingly baling sheaves of wheat, picking olives, oranges, peaches, grapes, the sweat on our brows a shining reminder of the nobility of collective farming. In the evenings, we would gather together and dance around the fire, sing Crosby, Stills, Nash, \u0026 Young songs and, if one\u0027s older siblings were any indication, lose our virginity. Years later, we would renounce our bourgeois upbringings and return to Israel, making lives of simple, agrarian bliss. This would all change for me in one single evening, in a shed of 5,000 chickens.","The kibbutz I was assigned to was one of the oldest in Israel, settled in 1928 by Jews from Russia, Poland, and Germany. For the most part, our arrival was met with little to no notice. We were just another group of volunteers, no different from the countless other Europeans and Australians just passing through, taking time out to pick fruit, work on their tans, and contract cystitis from their rampant and unchecked coitus. But we were different. We were members of the movement.","I thought that our political ardor would be immediately apparent. I had visions of our bus being greeted by garlanded, folk-dancing youth, so happy to have us there to share in their dream. I had been raised on a fairly steady diet of just such socialist, utopian Ziegfeld numbers, songs, film strips, and oral histories that all attested to just this scenario.","Trees weren\u0027t simply trees. They were jungle gyms of plenty, with smiling children clambering over their branches. A field was somewhere you brought your guitar, so that your comrades could dance down the rows after the day\u0027s work was over.","I was assigned to pick pears. Work would begin at 4:00 AM and finish sometime mid-morning, before the heat had set in. How filled with fervor I was that first morning, the light barely dawning as I headed out in the back of the truck, wearing my simple work shirt, a pair of shorts, and the traditional sun hat worn by so many pioneers who had come before me to make the desert bloom. I should pause here to point out that we actually said things like \"make the desert bloom,\" all the time. So off I headed to the orchard.","I know I sound like the Central Casting New Yorker I\u0027ve turned myself into with single-minded determination when I say this, but the main problem with working in the fields is that the sun is just always shining. Dyed-in-the-wool Northerner that I am, it became apparent after about two days that I was completely unsuited to working outside. And I was moved around among the kibbutz\u0027s various interior jobs, the furniture factory, the metal irrigation parts factory, and the kitchen, assured all the while by the group leader that there was nothing emasculating or ersatz socialist in being moved inside. After all, each according to his needs, each according to his abilities. My abilities seemed to lie in passing out from heat stroke after a scant two hours in an orchard.","This continued for weeks. It was a somewhat idyllic, if not a mite monotonous existence, that is, until the long night of the chickens. The boys of our group were gathered together one day and told in the hushed tones reserved for trying to avert impending disaster that we would forgo our regular work details and spend the night from midnight until dawn packing truckloads of poultry.","Why this needed to be done with such urgent secrecy under cover of night and why the girls were excused was never explained to us. And we didn\u0027t ask. We greeted the news with the respectful Hemingway silence of the Y chromosome, no dopey girls allowed. It was all imbued with nocturnal, testicular melodrama, like some summer stock production of Das Boot.","We slept that evening from 9:00 to 11:00, what I would come to know later, in a far different context, as a disco nap. We rose, drank some tea. The girls sprayed perfume into some handkerchiefs for us to wear around our noses and mouths. And we were off in trucks to do battle with the insurgent chickens. The scene had everything but the diner waitress standing in the road watching us go, worriedly wiping her hands on her gingham apron.","The chicken coop of the kibbutz was a one-storied structure of corrugated iron, about half the size of a football field. It emitted a low rumbling, a vague buzz that you could hear from far away. And of course from even farther away, there was the smell, a smell of such head-kicking intensity as to make a perfume-sprayed handkerchief almost adorable in its valiant naivete, Wile E. Coyote warding off a falling boulder with his paper parasol. And the combination of floral scent and dung merely increased the vileness.","Chicken [BLEEP] is horrible stuff. Unlike cow manure, which according to David Foster Wallace, smells \"warm and herbal and blameless,\" chicken [BLEEP] is an olfactory insult, a snarling, saw-toothed, ammoniac, cheesy smell, needlessly, gratuitously disgusting, a stench of such assaultive tenacity that it burns your eyes. Rather than making you never want to eat a chicken again, it simply makes you angry. It makes you hold a grudge. You\u0027ll eat chicken again, by god, and you\u0027ll chew really, really hard.","One of the barrel-chested Israelis shows us what to do. Pick up four chickens in each hand. This is done by grabbing hold of the birds by one leg. \"If the leg snaps,\" he says, \"it doesn\u0027t matter, just to get four in each hand. B\u0027seder?\" he says. OK?","He faces us, holding the requisite eight, four in each hand, living masses of writhing feathers. He looks like some German expressionist cheerleader, his pom-poms alive, convulsing, filthy. \"Who will see their dreams fall away into the abyss and eventually succumb to the crushing sadness and meaninglessness of it all? We will. And what does that spell? Madness. Louder. I can\u0027t hear you.\"","He crams the chickens roughly into a blue plastic crate smeared with wet guano. \"And you close the lid, and tchick tchack,\" he tells us, clapping his hands with \"that\u0027s that\" finality. Before I even try, I know that I will not be able to do this. It is midnight, and we will be here until dawn, or until the truck is piled to capacity with crated birds.","I walk out into the sea of chickens. I reach down and grab one, its leg a slightly thicker, segmented chopstick. I recoil and stand up. I take a fetid breath, regroup, and bend down with new resolve, grab the chicken by its body with both hands, thinking somehow that might be preferable. Although how I think I\u0027m going to get eight of them this way, I\u0027m not sure. Its ribs expand and contract under my fingers, a dirty, warm, live umbrella. I drop the bird as if it were boiling hot.","I leave the coop and go out to the trucks. Hoisting myself up onto the flatbed, I start to help with the stacking of the full crates. I know that my unilateral decision to change my task is met with displeasure on the part of the men who run the coop, but I do not care. Their muttered comments are predicated on a direct poultry-penile relationship. I might as well have spurned the stag party whore or gone to the woodshop and fashioned myself a sign that said \"fag.\" \"Ma ito? What\u0027s the matter with him,\" the head of the work detail asks when he sees me on the truck.","[SPEAKING HEBREW], he is answered, using the female pronoun when referring to me. \"The lady doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\"","It would be years before I was referred to as \"she\" again, and then very rarely and only as a joke by friends. I turn around to look at the man, making it quite clear to him that I understand what they are saying. The man who called me \"she\" avoids my eyes and busies himself with straightening a pile of crates and tightening the tarpaulin on the side of the truck. \"You\u0027re right,\" I tell him in Hebrew. \"She doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\"","Have you ever had one of those moments when you know that you are being visited by your own future? They come so rarely and with so little fanfare, those moments. They\u0027re not particularly photogenic. There\u0027s no breach in the clouds to reveal the shining city on a hill, no folk-dancing children outside your bus, no production values to speak of, just a glimpse of such quotidian, incontrovertible truth that after the initial shock at the supreme weirdness of it all, a kind of calm sets in. So this is to be my life.","At that very moment, I saw that I would never live on a kibbutz. I would not lose my virginity that summer to any of the girls from the group. Indeed, I would not care to do so. I am grateful to that macho blowhard. He made me consciously realize what I had always known but been somehow unable to say to myself. He\u0027s right. I don\u0027t like chickens. I like men.","Now, I live in Manhattan, the un-kibbutz, where nobody would dream of touching a live chicken, where whatever spirit of collectivist altruism people might have had dried up long ago. At camp, when I was young, I and the other children of affluent professionals would gather under the trees every day to sing before going into lunch. One of the songs was always \"The Internationale,\" the hymn of the proletariat. One summer, we were even taught to sing it with our left fists raised.","We were, none of us, by any stretch of the imagination, what could be described as prisoners of starvation, wretched of the earth, or enthralled slaves. Admittedly, they are all catchier metaphors and easier to scan than, \"Arise, ye children of psychiatrists,\" but they had little to nothing to do with us personally. And yet, for those few moments when we were singing, those words seemed so true. How can I describe to you that 11-year-old\u0027s sense of purpose, that thrill of belonging to something larger, something outside of my own body, the sheer heart-stopping beauty of a world of justice and perfection rising on new foundations. And that one line, \"We have been naught. We shall be all.\"","Naught. It spoke as much about my wish to be delivered from this pre-adolescent self-loathing as it did to any consciousness of liberating the masses. But it held such promise of what I might hope for that even now, as I write this, I can still call up that old fervor.

We have this story from David Rakoff, which begins far, far away from any chicken house."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Friday nights of my childhood and early adolescence were spent at weekly meetings of a socialist, Zionist, youth movement. My brother, sister, and I were members. The meetings took a variety of forms. There were the earnest discussions of Marx and the great labor Zionist thinkers like Theodore Herzl and A. D. Gordon, bull sessions about who in the group had hurt whose feelings, and playing air guitar to \"Come Sail Away\" by Styx. All activities that formed us into pretty deeply committed young socialists, ready at the age of 15 for the ultimate prize the movement could bestow, a summer living and working on a kibbutz, one of the collective farms that were a central part of settling the Jewish state."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"There, we would meet other members of the movement from all over the world and spend many a happy hour engaged in honest labor, laughingly baling sheaves of wheat, picking olives, oranges, peaches, grapes, the sweat on our brows a shining reminder of the nobility of collective farming. In the evenings, we would gather together and dance around the fire, sing Crosby, Stills, Nash, \u0026 Young songs and, if one\u0027s older siblings were any indication, lose our virginity. Years later, we would renounce our bourgeois upbringings and return to Israel, making lives of simple, agrarian bliss. This would all change for me in one single evening, in a shed of 5,000 chickens."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"The kibbutz I was assigned to was one of the oldest in Israel, settled in 1928 by Jews from Russia, Poland, and Germany. For the most part, our arrival was met with little to no notice. We were just another group of volunteers, no different from the countless other Europeans and Australians just passing through, taking time out to pick fruit, work on their tans, and contract cystitis from their rampant and unchecked coitus. But we were different. We were members of the movement."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I thought that our political ardor would be immediately apparent. I had visions of our bus being greeted by garlanded, folk-dancing youth, so happy to have us there to share in their dream. I had been raised on a fairly steady diet of just such socialist, utopian Ziegfeld numbers, songs, film strips, and oral histories that all attested to just this scenario."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Trees weren\u0027t simply trees. They were jungle gyms of plenty, with smiling children clambering over their branches. A field was somewhere you brought your guitar, so that your comrades could dance down the rows after the day\u0027s work was over."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I was assigned to pick pears. Work would begin at 4:00 AM and finish sometime mid-morning, before the heat had set in. How filled with fervor I was that first morning, the light barely dawning as I headed out in the back of the truck, wearing my simple work shirt, a pair of shorts, and the traditional sun hat worn by so many pioneers who had come before me to make the desert bloom. I should pause here to point out that we actually said things like \"make the desert bloom,\" all the time. So off I headed to the orchard."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I know I sound like the Central Casting New Yorker I\u0027ve turned myself into with single-minded determination when I say this, but the main problem with working in the fields is that the sun is just always shining. Dyed-in-the-wool Northerner that I am, it became apparent after about two days that I was completely unsuited to working outside. And I was moved around among the kibbutz\u0027s various interior jobs, the furniture factory, the metal irrigation parts factory, and the kitchen, assured all the while by the group leader that there was nothing emasculating or ersatz socialist in being moved inside. After all, each according to his needs, each according to his abilities. My abilities seemed to lie in passing out from heat stroke after a scant two hours in an orchard."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"This continued for weeks. It was a somewhat idyllic, if not a mite monotonous existence, that is, until the long night of the chickens. The boys of our group were gathered together one day and told in the hushed tones reserved for trying to avert impending disaster that we would forgo our regular work details and spend the night from midnight until dawn packing truckloads of poultry."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Why this needed to be done with such urgent secrecy under cover of night and why the girls were excused was never explained to us. And we didn\u0027t ask. We greeted the news with the respectful Hemingway silence of the Y chromosome, no dopey girls allowed. It was all imbued with nocturnal, testicular melodrama, like some summer stock production of Das Boot."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"We slept that evening from 9:00 to 11:00, what I would come to know later, in a far different context, as a disco nap. We rose, drank some tea. The girls sprayed perfume into some handkerchiefs for us to wear around our noses and mouths. And we were off in trucks to do battle with the insurgent chickens. The scene had everything but the diner waitress standing in the road watching us go, worriedly wiping her hands on her gingham apron."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"The chicken coop of the kibbutz was a one-storied structure of corrugated iron, about half the size of a football field. It emitted a low rumbling, a vague buzz that you could hear from far away. And of course from even farther away, there was the smell, a smell of such head-kicking intensity as to make a perfume-sprayed handkerchief almost adorable in its valiant naivete, Wile E. Coyote warding off a falling boulder with his paper parasol. And the combination of floral scent and dung merely increased the vileness."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Chicken [BLEEP] is horrible stuff. Unlike cow manure, which according to David Foster Wallace, smells \"warm and herbal and blameless,\" chicken [BLEEP] is an olfactory insult, a snarling, saw-toothed, ammoniac, cheesy smell, needlessly, gratuitously disgusting, a stench of such assaultive tenacity that it burns your eyes. Rather than making you never want to eat a chicken again, it simply makes you angry. It makes you hold a grudge. You\u0027ll eat chicken again, by god, and you\u0027ll chew really, really hard."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"One of the barrel-chested Israelis shows us what to do. Pick up four chickens in each hand. This is done by grabbing hold of the birds by one leg. \"If the leg snaps,\" he says, \"it doesn\u0027t matter, just to get four in each hand. B\u0027seder?\" he says. OK?"},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"He faces us, holding the requisite eight, four in each hand, living masses of writhing feathers. He looks like some German expressionist cheerleader, his pom-poms alive, convulsing, filthy. \"Who will see their dreams fall away into the abyss and eventually succumb to the crushing sadness and meaninglessness of it all? We will. And what does that spell? Madness. Louder. I can\u0027t hear you.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"He crams the chickens roughly into a blue plastic crate smeared with wet guano. \"And you close the lid, and tchick tchack,\" he tells us, clapping his hands with \"that\u0027s that\" finality. Before I even try, I know that I will not be able to do this. It is midnight, and we will be here until dawn, or until the truck is piled to capacity with crated birds."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I walk out into the sea of chickens. I reach down and grab one, its leg a slightly thicker, segmented chopstick. I recoil and stand up. I take a fetid breath, regroup, and bend down with new resolve, grab the chicken by its body with both hands, thinking somehow that might be preferable. Although how I think I\u0027m going to get eight of them this way, I\u0027m not sure. Its ribs expand and contract under my fingers, a dirty, warm, live umbrella. I drop the bird as if it were boiling hot."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I leave the coop and go out to the trucks. Hoisting myself up onto the flatbed, I start to help with the stacking of the full crates. I know that my unilateral decision to change my task is met with displeasure on the part of the men who run the coop, but I do not care. Their muttered comments are predicated on a direct poultry-penile relationship. I might as well have spurned the stag party whore or gone to the woodshop and fashioned myself a sign that said \"fag.\" \"Ma ito? What\u0027s the matter with him,\" the head of the work detail asks when he sees me on the truck."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"[SPEAKING HEBREW], he is answered, using the female pronoun when referring to me. \"The lady doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"It would be years before I was referred to as \"she\" again, and then very rarely and only as a joke by friends. I turn around to look at the man, making it quite clear to him that I understand what they are saying. The man who called me \"she\" avoids my eyes and busies himself with straightening a pile of crates and tightening the tarpaulin on the side of the truck. \"You\u0027re right,\" I tell him in Hebrew. \"She doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Have you ever had one of those moments when you know that you are being visited by your own future? They come so rarely and with so little fanfare, those moments. They\u0027re not particularly photogenic. There\u0027s no breach in the clouds to reveal the shining city on a hill, no folk-dancing children outside your bus, no production values to speak of, just a glimpse of such quotidian, incontrovertible truth that after the initial shock at the supreme weirdness of it all, a kind of calm sets in. So this is to be my life."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"At that very moment, I saw that I would never live on a kibbutz. I would not lose my virginity that summer to any of the girls from the group. Indeed, I would not care to do so. I am grateful to that macho blowhard. He made me consciously realize what I had always known but been somehow unable to say to myself. He\u0027s right. I don\u0027t like chickens. I like men."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Now, I live in Manhattan, the un-kibbutz, where nobody would dream of touching a live chicken, where whatever spirit of collectivist altruism people might have had dried up long ago. At camp, when I was young, I and the other children of affluent professionals would gather under the trees every day to sing before going into lunch. One of the songs was always \"The Internationale,\" the hymn of the proletariat. One summer, we were even taught to sing it with our left fists raised."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"We were, none of us, by any stretch of the imagination, what could be described as prisoners of starvation, wretched of the earth, or enthralled slaves. Admittedly, they are all catchier metaphors and easier to scan than, \"Arise, ye children of psychiatrists,\" but they had little to nothing to do with us personally. And yet, for those few moments when we were singing, those words seemed so true. How can I describe to you that 11-year-old\u0027s sense of purpose, that thrill of belonging to something larger, something outside of my own body, the sheer heart-stopping beauty of a world of justice and perfection rising on new foundations. And that one line, \"We have been naught. We shall be all.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Naught. It spoke as much about my wish to be delivered from this pre-adolescent self-loathing as it did to any consciousness of liberating the masses. But it held such promise of what I might hope for that even now, as I write this, I can still call up that old fervor. It still makes my breath catch in my throat."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"David Rakoff\u0027s a writer in New York."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, our program was produced today by Alix Spiegel and myself with Nancy Updike and Julie Snyder, contributing editors Paul Tough, Jack Hitt, Margy Rochlin, and Consigliere Sarah Vowell.

As the city person, or the suburban homeowner, you know that the farm person you\u0027re talking to is just thinking the entire time you\u0027re talking to them, \"You are so naive.\" A lot of these conversations have to do with animals and their deaths."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Take this example. The woman who runs the website for our radio show, Elizabeth Meister, was at the annual exhibition run by the American Poultry Association in Columbus, Ohio. And here she is. She\u0027s standing in a room with 12,000 chickens. And she gets into this conversation with an 11-year-old girl."},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"I\u0027ve only been in poultry and waterfowl for a year. I\u0027m more into waterfowl."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is Kamiko Overs from Bliss, New York, who was at the convention to show some of her own birds."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Meister","text":"So do your friends think it\u0027s weird? Do they think it\u0027s strange that you show chickens and stuff?"},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"No, because a lot of people show. They\u0027ll either be showing pigs, or cows, or rabbits, or something like that. A lot of people in our school show different things."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Kamiko and Elizabeth talked for a while. And then Elizabeth tried, very, very gently, to ask a question that was on her mind."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Meister","text":"Do you-- this is sort of a hard question for me to ask. But do you ever eat them?"},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"Yeah, I do."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Meister","text":"You do. And does it make you really sad when-- do you raise these chickens from little chicks?"},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"Yeah, we hatch them out. And then, yep. We get them right from the hen. And we eat them a lot. We do raise a lot for eating."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Meister","text":"And so when you\u0027re cooking up this chicken that you\u0027ve raised from being a little chick, do you feel a little bit guilty that you\u0027re eating this chicken?"},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Meister","text":"No?"},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Meister","text":"Do you ever eat the chickens that you show?"},{"speakerName":"Kamiko Overs","text":"If they\u0027re no good for show, the losers, yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Kamiko is untroubled by this. If a bird has bad feathers or a lopsided comb, it might be a nice bird. But it\u0027s not going to win competitions. You eat it. That\u0027s life."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Those of us who do not live on farms, we divide animals off into those we love and those we eat. In Kamiko\u0027s world, there\u0027s not such a hard line separating the two. You can get to know a bird on an up-close and one-to-one basis and still eat it. An animal\u0027s transition from buddy to dinner is a great deal less problematic than it is for us city folks."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. And every year, during the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the highest poultry consumption time of the year in these United States, we bring you a program about poultry, our annual Poultry Slam, stories of chickens, turkeys, ducks, birds of all kinds, and our relationships with them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In past years, we have brought you an opera about the life of Chicken Little. We\u0027ve brought you the story of a hand puppet duck that would not leave people\u0027s lives. And naturally, we\u0027ve brought you real stories of actually growing up with turkeys, and chickens, and other birds. And in putting together this year\u0027s show, a very few particular ideas and questions kept coming up in story after story. Without us ever intending for it to happen this way, a lot of this year\u0027s show has turned into a kind of referendum about where you draw that line between friend and food."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One of today\u0027s program, Still Life with Chicken. Food writer Jonathan Gold tells what it\u0027s like to pan-fry a chicken with a live chicken watching you the entire time. Act Two, Last Meal. When Francois Mitterand knew he was about to die, he decided that the last food to cross his lips would be poultry, a tiny bird that is actually illegal to eat in France, a bird that, by tradition, is eaten with a napkin covering your head. Michael Paterniti set out for France to try the contraband capon himself. He has a full report."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Three, People who Love Chickens and Hate This American Life. Last year, a woman named Karen Davis started a national letter-writing campaign to try to get This American Life to stop the very program you\u0027re listening to at this very moment, the annual Poultry Slam. In this portion of our show, she explains what it is that we just do not understand about poultry, and why the whole idea of this poultry show was wrongheaded from the start. Act Four, The Meaning of a Bird. David Rakoff explains how his life was changed in a single evening in a room of 5,000 chickens. Stay with us."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Still Life with Chicken. It was an accident that Jonathan ended up living with the chicken. He was not living the kind of lifestyle that one usually associates with chicken."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"This was during the period when I considered myself to be a performance artist of a sort, a naked performance artist, to be specific."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"These days, Jonathan Gold is a food writer in Los Angeles. This all happened 15 years ago. He was putting together a performance. He had a PA system which could put out the requisite amount of annoying feedback sound at high decibels. He had the two full bottles of Glade American Beauty air freshener, which he would spray, in their entirety, in the performance space."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And he had a live chicken, which he bought the day before the performance in one of those Chinese poultry markets in Los Angeles. And it comes the day of the show. An audience gathers in a darkened warehouse in West LA."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve been to a lot of performance art, but this was really typical of the stuff that was going on in the period. And I showed up, and I was naked. And I was carrying a machete, and I was blindfolded. And I stood in the middle of this pile of supermarket chickens, the broilers that you buy. And the chicken that I bought was tethered to a three-foot rope around me. And I hacked up and down blindly with a machete."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Toward the chicken, or just in general?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Well, I was blindfolded, so I didn\u0027t know if it was towards the chicken or not. And I had fully intended that, in fact, I would kill the chicken in the midst of this performance. But chickens aren\u0027t that stupid. And this chicken wanted no part of the machete, stayed at the end of its rope the entire time, apparently."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And after 10 minutes, when I was completely exhausted, I fell to a heap, and everybody left. And the performance was over. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve stuck around after an art performance, but the few minutes after an art performance are some of the most depressing in the world."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How so?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"You\u0027ve done your wad. You\u0027ve done your bit for art, which has either worked or it hasn\u0027t. But you\u0027re sitting there. You\u0027re covered with chicken effluvia, in my case. It stinks to high hell. Everybody\u0027s gone, and you\u0027ve got to clean up. And you\u0027re naked. It\u0027s really not a pretty picture."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So Jonathan cleaned up. And when he was done, he had a chicken. And he didn\u0027t feel like he could kill the chicken. Destiny had brought them together. He felt like he could not turn his back."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He says it was the same as if a kitten shows up on your back door, scratching, and lonely, and needy. So he took the chicken home. And in doing that, he stumbled across that thin, thin line that separates food items on the one hand from pets on the other, that divides the animals we eat from the animals we love."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"So I get home, and I have this chicken. And I don\u0027t know what to do with it. So I spread out some newspaper on the top of my refrigerator, and I put the chicken up there."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"I get a can of Green Giant brand niblets from under the counter. And I open it, and I put it in a little bowl for the chicken. And I give the chicken a little water. And the chicken\u0027s on top of my refrigerator."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Because you think chickens eat corn. You had read that or something. And that was the available corn."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"That was the available corn. I wish I had thought better of the niblets idea."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Why?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Because in fact, if you\u0027re buying three or four cans of niblets a day, which is what the chicken ate, and you\u0027re existing on almost nothing, which I was, then your niblet bill turns out to be some two-figure percentage of your total income each week. If you can imagine living on $50 a week, but $10 of it goes for niblets. It\u0027s just hard to justify an expense like that."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Though at the remove of 15 years, I think I can probably safely admit to you now that one of the reasons that I stuck with the niblets is because I liked saying the word \"niblets\" so much. And this gave me the excuse to use the words like \"niblet\" in general conversation several times a day. Usually, it just doesn\u0027t come up."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And the chicken stayed there, on top of my refrigerator, for a long time, months, six months, I think."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is a one room apartment?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"A two room apartment. I had a kitchen and a bedroom. So I didn\u0027t have to look at the chicken when I was sleeping, though I did have to look at it when I was cooking."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you ever cook chicken?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Of course I cooked chicken."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Didn\u0027t you feel intensely disloyal?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"No, I felt no particular loyalty to this chicken. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever had chickens, but it\u0027s not like-- you don\u0027t pet chickens. Chickens don\u0027t really like you to pet them. And you don\u0027t hold them. There\u0027s really no love that you feel for a chicken in your life, I don\u0027t think."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But yet you kept the chicken."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"I kept the chicken because I couldn\u0027t bear to do anything else. And it\u0027s not like I could have carried it out onto Pico Boulevard and said, \"Be free, little chicken. Be free.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you give the chicken a name?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"I never named the chicken. When I referred to the chicken in public, I always called it \"the hen.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How did you not name it? It was a creature in your house."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"The chicken always seemed temporary. It never occurred to me that I might have the chicken as long as six months. The chicken always seemed like something that I would have for just a couple days."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then what did you think was going to happen?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"A, I thought about the chicken expiring. B, I have to admit that there was a possibility that someday, I would actually cook the chicken. I went through a lot of chicken recipes, hundreds and hundreds of chicken recipes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Thinking, \"Maybe this\u0027ll be the recipe for my niblet-fed chicken?\""},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Exactly."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Possibly, I have to say, the most delicious chicken that you could ever eat, because of those niblets."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"You can\u0027t buy niblet-fed chicken for love or money, I don\u0027t think. I\u0027m not sure that a recipe existed that would have lived up to the fact of the chicken, this animal who you have come to know on fairly intimate terms, and who you have raised, and you have put a certain amount of emotion into."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"A chicken, if I might say, who has seen you naked."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"The chicken did see me naked, damn it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The fact is, we need food to be just food. And as soon as it becomes a living thing, especially if we\u0027re city people-- we\u0027re not used to the conversion of living things into our food-- it\u0027s hard to handle without thinking it has to be bigger than food, without wanting to make it ritualized or something bigger than food."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Exactly. Can I tell you a small story?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah, of course."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"A few weeks ago, I was in this Korean restaurant in Koreatown in Los Angeles. It was this place called the Living Fish Center that I\u0027d always wanted to go, because the name of it was so splendid. Living Fish Center, I imagine some sort of vast vivarium where Flipper was jumping through hoops and stuff."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And I go in there, and of course, it\u0027s just a crummy Korean restaurant. It\u0027s not that clean. And there are tanks and stuff, but I didn\u0027t know what to order."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"So I order a fish soup because it looks like they have a small fish soup specialty on the menu. And it comes, and it\u0027s just really strong-smelling and not that great. And I try squid fried with bean sauce and onions, which wasn\u0027t that happening."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And I\u0027m about to give up and pay the check and go home with a vast table filled with uneaten stuff. And it suddenly occurs to me what the specialty of the restaurant is. And I wave the waitress over, and I tell her that I\u0027d like a prawn."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And she is puzzled. She didn\u0027t expect me to ask for a prawn. But I repeat my request. And she shrugs and goes and tells the sushi chef."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And he goes to one side of the restaurant. And he climbs on this chair, this ordinary folding chair. And he reaches into this long tank that\u0027s running just below the ceiling. And he wiggles his fingers in the water. When he wiggles the fingers, the prawns just become enraged."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And they start nipping at his fingers, and they start attacking him. And he picks out a couple of the liveliest ones and brings them back to his counter and, without washing his hands, mind you, just makes a few motions over it. And a couple seconds later, the waitress comes over with the prawns on this huge mound of ice."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Now what he\u0027d done is he\u0027d taken off the exoskeleton. The head was intact, and that little part of the tail that is always on prawns was still there. But the middle part is naked, like a grub."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And I picked up the prawn with my chopsticks. And it was not dead, this prawn. It was extremely alive. And it was wiggling its legs. And it was wiggling its antennas."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And its eyes were swiveling madly on its eye stalks. And it was looking back at me, seeing me as actually the predator, the creature that was going to eat it. And that was a really freakish moment, because as much stuff as I eat, and as low as I eat on the food chain, and as many prawns as I have dispatched in my life, I have never before killed a living being with my teeth."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And the prawn knew what I was going to do. And he did not like it. And I wasn\u0027t quite sure what to do, but if I put it down, the prawn would have died anyway. It\u0027s not going to live without its shell. Somebody else would\u0027ve eaten it, blah, blah, blah."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"So I bit into it. I bit its body off with my teeth. And the prawn just relaxed in this way that was really eerie."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"And the taste of the prawn, the taste of the meat of it, was extraordinary. It was sweet. It was like there was life coursing through it. It was the most alive thing I\u0027ve ever eaten, obviously, literally. But again, it was freaky. It was getting too close to the actual nature of consumption, which is killing a living creature with your teeth."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you bit into the prawn, did you actually bite off its head, its living head, and have its head and its eyes in your mouth?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"No. I bit off its body, and I held the head in my hands."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So you held the head in one hand and the tail in the other, and you bit the center."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"Right. And I thought that I\u0027d killed it. But in fact, when I put it down, it still had so much life in it that it grabbed a piece of salmon sashimi and wouldn\u0027t let go of it. And I don\u0027t think I ever want to do that again."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you feel like there was something about the experience that made it more-- this word is a little cornier than I intend, but it\u0027s the only word that I can think of-- sacred, that took it out of the mundaneness of the way that we eat, which for most of us is eating without actually tasting and experiencing and thinking about what we\u0027re eating and what on the earth it is that we\u0027re killing to survive? Do you think in some way that it\u0027s more acceptable to eat an animal if you are more awake to the fact that it is an animal and what\u0027s happened to it? Or do you think it really doesn\u0027t matter?"},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"I think it matters a great deal. One of the greatest metaphors in Western civilization is that of Christ, who gave his life so that others might live. And I don\u0027t want to be sacrilegious, and I don\u0027t want to belittle that myth in any way."},{"speakerName":"Jonathan Gold","text":"But a pig is giving its life so that we might eat. A chicken is giving its life so that we might eat. And I think the least that we could do is to think about that chicken, to think about that calf that we\u0027re eating. Not necessarily to be sad for it, but to celebrate it, to be aware of the being that it was, that it wasn\u0027t just this bit of bioengineered protein that somehow managed to find its way onto our plates."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Jonathan Gold writes his food column, \"Counter Intelligence,\" for the LA Weekly. He\u0027s also the restaurant critic for Los Angeles magazine."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Two, Last Meal. Consider, please, poultry consumers, the role of poultry in Francois Mitterrand\u0027s last meal. Mitterrand, you\u0027ll recall, was the president of France, died at the beginning of 1996. A contradictory and enigmatic man, the French press used to call him the Sphinx. He once actually staged his own assassination to help himself in the polls. Obsessed with history and his place in it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Michael Paterniti wrote about Mitterrand\u0027s last meal for the magazine Esquire. Mitterrand found out that he was dying of cancer. Our story begins just weeks before his death."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Right before Christmas, Mitterrand went to Egypt to commune with the pharaohs. Even though he was extremely ill, he decided that he had to go there one last time."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You said he went to Egypt commune with the pharaohs?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Literally with the pharaohs?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Well, he felt this spiritual connection to these leaders of the past. And he studied the lives, and in particular, how many of these people died, what their last gestures were. And he felt that his last gesture would have to be equally fitting."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Equally grand."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah. And while he was there, he decided that he was going to have this amazing last meal. What he did was call back to France and made sure that they had this menu that he decided would be it, which was this amazing feast of oyster, and foie gras, and capon, and finally, this little songbird called ortolan, which symbolizes the French soul. And it was this completely forbidden thing to eat ortolan. It\u0027s illegal in France to do so."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Because it\u0027s an endangered species, right?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, and people who have served ortolan, chefs who\u0027ve served it in France, have been fined. And I think in one case, a chef was imprisoned for serving it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you look at all into why the ortolan would come to represent the soul of France?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"It was the food of kings in France. And once it was caught in these tiny traps, in very old times, they would actually poke the eyes of the bird out. So the bird would live in complete darkness and just eat 24 hours a day. And then when it was fattened, they would drown it in a kind of cognac. And there was this ritual associated with the preparation of the bird, as well as with eating the bird."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Actually, in Proust and Fielding, ortolan appear. And they symbolize seduction, and adultery, and virginity."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And one of the things about ortolan is that people eat it with a napkin over their head."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Right, people put a large cloth napkin over their head. And apparently, what the napkin does is it keeps the aroma inside this tent in which you\u0027re eating. And the French say that it also keeps God from seeing you eating the little birdie."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Meaning what?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Meaning that it\u0027s sinful, that the bird is so innocent."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And the pleasure so great?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And the pleasure so great that it\u0027s a sin."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And Mitterrand, when he had his last meal, he knew he was dying."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Right."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And he continued to survive for quite a while after the last meal, right?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"He lived eight days. And he didn\u0027t eat or drink during those days."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He just decided he wanted the last food that he had eaten to be the ortolan."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah. That was what was most incredible to me is that he had this huge dinner, and then consciously decided that would be his last meal, and then just readied himself for death."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So you arranged to go to France to try to taste this bird and have this meal, in fact, to try to recreate Mitterrand\u0027s last meal."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Right. And it started with 100 phone calls just to try to locate somebody who would even entertain the notion. And after, literally, months, there was one chef in Bordeaux who said that he would cook the meal."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And so you have this massive meal, ending with the bird."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And what do we know about when Mitterrand ate the bird?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Well, we know that during the meal, he slipped in and out of consciousness in between the courses. And he would eat ravenously, and then he would just sort of pass out. And he sat at a table separate from the table where all his guests were seated. There were about 30 people there, extended family and friends."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And Mitterrand would rise up with each new course and eat. But he really wasn\u0027t talking to many people. And he was really focused on trying to finish the meal and taste, apparently, every note in that meal."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you had your meal, do you feel like you were able to achieve that level of awareness, where you were tasting every note of the meal? It seems like such a high standard to aspire to."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"I felt like it was the most incredible meal I\u0027ve eaten. And it was because I was very focused on everything that went into my mouth, and also, because when it came to the ortolan, there\u0027s no easy way to eat ortolan. You are forced to taste every bite. And it goes from being completely sublime to being excruciating."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Describe what it\u0027s like to eat the bird. We should say that the bird, you describe it as the size of your thumb, smaller than your thumbs."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, it is. It\u0027s about the size of your thumb. And they serve it in a white cassoulet. And you put the napkin over your head, and you duck down toward the cassoulet. And so you are in this space that is completely white, the white napkin, the white plate, the white cassoulet. And then you have the bird on its back that you lift up and put into your mouth. You cool it by breathing in and out."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And this is the entire bird, every part of it."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yes. In our case, the chef insisted that we bite off the head and leave the head on the plate. I think in Mitterrand\u0027s case, he ate the head, too."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"OK. So you bite off the head. You leave the head on the plate."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And then you cool it, and then you begin to chew. And that first bite is incredibly difficult to describe, because it\u0027s terrifying. I was terrified. I was nauseous with the idea of it."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"But the first bite of the bird changed that. It was incredibly and almost immediately delicious. And all these juices were flowing out of it into your mouth and mingling and commingling with everything that was already in your mouth. And it\u0027s like this very finely evolved consomme."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And then you begin to taste the meat. And they\u0027re little, tender bits of meat. And then, I think you begin to taste the organs. And it becomes more bitter. So the sweetness and the tenderness turns bitter."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And then, well, you keep chewing ortolan until you have chewed it completely. And then you\u0027re supposed to swallow it all at once. And there\u0027s no other way, really, to consume it. And as you continue to chew, it gets harder and harder, because you\u0027re working the bones, finally."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"So the meat and the juices fade. And you suddenly are chewing these bones. And that is when you really, I think, fall into a bit of an existential crisis. Like, what the hell am I doing? And then also, I really think I\u0027m going to throw up."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And how am I going to swallow these bones?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"And how am I going to swallow them? Many people who have never had ortolan before end up spitting it out on the plate. And in fact, at Mitterrand\u0027s last meal, a number of the people in the room did spit out their ortolan."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That seems like incredibly bad form, though. You\u0027re spitting out the soul of France."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, you\u0027re incredibly gauche if you pull that stunt."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did this experience change you?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, it definitely changed me. I didn\u0027t eat chicken for a long time."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Why?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Because I think I felt guilty."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Guilty like you didn\u0027t feel like it was right to eat a bird without the sacred quality that it had to eat the ortolan?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, I think it has everything to do with feeling, in some ways, like I had actually eaten the last meal. And for me to put anything else inside of my body would mean that it would have to be somehow as sacred, or holy, or as good. And it\u0027s not like I am suddenly a vegetarian now. Finally, I ate whatever, because I was hungry, without thinking about, for instance, the life that I was putting inside of me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Was it a relief not to taste the food again?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, because it takes a lot of energy and concentration. And it takes faith, and all of these things that we don\u0027t associate with eating, when you really taste a meal. It takes concentration and silence. And at the same time, understand how that meal came to your table."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The way you describe it, it\u0027s almost like you\u0027re saying that if we were really awake to what the world is giving us in a given meal, it would be hard eat the meal every single time."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, I feel like we would age really quickly."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you think we would age because we\u0027d be doing so much thinking and so much mental work during the meal?"},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"Yeah, it\u0027d be like a time-lapse version of your life, if you were psychically, spiritually, physically, intellectually, erotically present at every meal."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But you\u0027re saying that we have to deaden ourselves in order to live."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"I think we do, to a degree."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But I think-- I have to say, what\u0027s radical about what you\u0027re saying is you\u0027re saying, maybe that isn\u0027t such a horrible thing. Maybe that actually has to be the way."},{"speakerName":"Michael Paterniti","text":"I wish it weren\u0027t. But I don\u0027t think we make enough time to eat. And if we haven\u0027t made enough time to eat, then it\u0027s better not to taste what we are eating. It\u0027s easier."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Michael Paterniti in Portland, Maine. Coming up, a woman who thinks that This American Life is bad for an entire species, and when a perfumed handkerchief does not do what you want it to do. That\u0027s in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of stories on that theme. Today, during the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the time of year when poultry consumption is at its greatest in this country, we bring you our annual Poultry Slam, stories of chickens, turkeys, ducks, fowl of all kind, and our relationship with them. We have come to act three of our program, Act Three, People who Love Birds and Hate This American Life."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, I hold in my hand a stack of, I\u0027d say that it\u0027s about 50 letters that I\u0027ve received from around the country. Here is one from Yonkers, New York. It begins, \"Dear Mr. Glass, I was profoundly shocked to learn that for two years in a row, during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, you have produced a Poultry Slam program, in which cruel and demeaning jokes and anecdotes are told about chickens and turkeys.\" Here\u0027s another letter from Santa Monica. It begins, \"Dear Mr. Glass, we were profoundly shocked to learn that for two years in a row, during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, you have produced a Poultry Slam program--\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The wording is identical in these. In fact, the wording is identical in most of the letters. The first wave of mail was organized by a woman named Karen Davis, head and founder of a group called United Poultry Concerns. We invited her onto the program to correct whatever misinformation she thought we were spreading. She, in turn, invited me out to her home, out in poultry country in eastern Virginia."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"OK, birds, let\u0027s go."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Every morning, Karen lets 55 birds out of the converted garage behind her house. They stay in there overnight as protection against predators."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"It\u0027s OK. Come on. Hi, birds. Come on out."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s a lovely, friendly chaos, like a scene from Dr. Doolittle."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[ROOSTER CROWING]"},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"All right, good. Go on outside."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Nearly all of these birds are refugees from the commercial poultry industry. Karen started taking care of birds that had fallen out of trucks, or had been left behind, or escaped. She let animal shelters know that she would care for chickens. People started bringing her birds. She gets birds from school hatching projects. And now, she\u0027s got a big, fenced-in back yard full of them."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"These two roosters are the kinds of birds who are used by the meat industry. As you can see, they\u0027re extremely large, very overweight. They\u0027re crippled. They\u0027re typical."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you say crippled, how are they crippled?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"Well, one is sitting because he can\u0027t get up. And they have skeletal problems. It\u0027s their entire skeleton through their system is just not able to accommodate the rapidly growing body that\u0027s imposed upon the skeletal system when they\u0027re young. So they are very susceptible to being crippled and to having a wide range of skeletal diseases."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In nature, it takes a chicken six months to grow to full maturity. But with selective breeding and specially formulated feed, the poultry industry now raises a bird to full size in just six weeks. Then they\u0027re butchered."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What Karen Davis is doing is keeping birds alive that are not designed to live very long. Putting on all this extra weight so fast, so young, strains the heart and lungs, she says. And typically, their bodies give out when they\u0027re just two years old. That\u0027s versus traditional breeds, which can live 10, 15 years."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And what she finds when she cares for these birds in a loving way, outside the crowded chicken houses they were born into, is that they defy the stereotypes that most people have about chickens. They\u0027re not stupid, or dirty, or cold-hearted. Take Henry, one of the first birds Karen brought home."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"Henry had fallen off a truck. He was from a breeder operation. He had a severely debeaked upper beak. And he was covered with filth. He eventually became very snowy white. And he was very scared of people. And he was like anybody who\u0027s lived as a creature with no identity in a mass situation. He had no sense of who he was or where he was."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"But this changed. After he had been with me and my husband for about three or four months, he became very, very affectionate. He liked to be held. His feathers came in very beautifully. And he became a very sweet, affectionate bird. And he would come when I would call him up the back steps. And he--"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Here\u0027s one area where Karen Davis is completely in the right, and I and my radio staff have been absolutely wrong. In our earlier Poultry Slams, three or four times, people referred to chickens as stupid, as having no personality. In last year\u0027s show, at one point, I myself declared that if chickens had a personality, that personality seemed to be that they\u0027re a pain in the ass. And while this may be true for the chickens I observed, which were raised in the crowded gulag of commercial production, chickens raised properly, well, they can be kind of sweet."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"Want to demonstrate your sweetness? Do you? This hen has been with us since she was 10 weeks old. Haven\u0027t you been?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Karen showed me Ella, who likes her neck stroked. And Elise, who jumps over the fence every morning and jumps back in every night. And Lois and Lambrusco, a pair who stick together all the time. And Dolores, who\u0027s sort of shy. She says meat-eaters like me usually don\u0027t like to think that chickens have personalities, because then it would be too hard to eat them."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"They\u0027re very homey birds. That\u0027s another thing is if you brought a chair out here, and you were sitting out here reading a book, or working on something, or you sat out on the steps, they\u0027ll all collect around you. They like to be with you. They like to sit with you. They like to preen themselves next to you. And they\u0027ll sit with you for hours. That was one of the first things that drew me to them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We hung around the yard for half an hour and then went inside. She made a pot of coffee. And when we got to discussing This American Life, I have to say the mood got a good bit chillier. Karen Davis sees our annual Poultry Slam as one long piece of insensitive, anti-chicken propaganda."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"I thought it was a disgusting show. And it was just in the typical tradition of let\u0027s make dirty jokes about poultry and do it in a variety of voices. And it\u0027s just a mean-spirited show. It\u0027s very irresponsible, very irresponsible, to present lies, to really just take a collage of hostile attitudes and complacent, smirking voices and put them all together and feel that we\u0027re doing something worthwhile. I understand that the show says something to the effect that this is about America, and this American life, and how we see ourselves. And it\u0027s really about us and not about them. But it\u0027s the birds who get the bad rap."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"If you\u0027ve heard much of today\u0027s program at all, if you didn\u0027t just turn on your radio a moment or two ago, then you got a pretty good sense of the tone of our previous Poultry Slams. And even stories that actually tried to document cruelty to poultry, for instance one woman\u0027s rather grim memoir of growing up on a turkey farm, even this, Karen found offensive in tone and in spirit."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I pointed out that half the stories in previous years had not even been about real chickens. One was about a duck hand puppet. One was about a radio superhero called Chicken Man. One was an opera about Chicken Little, staged entirely with finger puppets."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC PLAYING FROM \"LA PULCINA PICCOLA\"]"},{"text":"But Karen would have none of it."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"I remember this woman speaking about the chicken as opera diva, which again, of course, was just a joke, and about Chicken Little being an opera diva. That itself is, again, disparaging. It\u0027s not the worst kind of thing you can do. But the woman\u0027s whole voice, the very tone of her voice, the attitude, the way she talked about chickens, was not in a spirit of goodwill. It\u0027s an ill-willed presentation."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I just have to differ with you. When I think about the woman in that story, she\u0027s very affectionate towards the characters in her opera."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"She made some hostile comments about chickens, again, that had no connection to who chickens even are. And maybe she doesn\u0027t even know any chickens herself. She\u0027s just doing what so many people do. She\u0027s just talking off the top of her head. And chickens are easy to, again, make into characters who you can laugh and smirk over."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But I guess I\u0027m saying, she\u0027s not laughing and smirking. She loves her chicken characters, like all the birds in the thing. She clearly loves them."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"She said something to the effect on that show that chickens had no personalities and didn\u0027t know who they were. I don\u0027t remember exactly what it was. But it was one of those kinds of statements."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But that was just one moment in a story that, in a certain way, had less to do with chickens and much more to do with what it means to create something emotional and grand out of something so small as finger puppets. Karen Davis and I argued for a long time about whether there was anything in our program at all, besides slander against chickens. And in the end, we simply do not agree. I asked her why, if there\u0027s this genocide of millions of chickens a day, with ads on television encouraging people to tear at chickens\u0027 flesh with their teeth, ads that reach many more people than we do on our radio show, why go after us?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you feel like somehow by stopping us, that that\u0027s going to change the situation for chickens, that that\u0027s going to have an impact on the number of birds killed and mistreated?"},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"It could. You\u0027re part of the problem. As long as you do this show called a Poultry Slam, you\u0027re part of the problem. You\u0027re one of the reasons. You\u0027re one of the many components of the abuse. You\u0027re part of the problem."},{"speakerName":"Karen Davis","text":"[MUSIC - \"CHICKENS\" BY HARRY BELAFONTE]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Four, Meaning of a Chicken. For most of us who have little to no contact with living, breathing chickens, the fact is that chickens mean what we decide that they mean. We have this story from David Rakoff, which begins far, far away from any chicken house."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Friday nights of my childhood and early adolescence were spent at weekly meetings of a socialist, Zionist, youth movement. My brother, sister, and I were members. The meetings took a variety of forms. There were the earnest discussions of Marx and the great labor Zionist thinkers like Theodore Herzl and A. D. Gordon, bull sessions about who in the group had hurt whose feelings, and playing air guitar to \"Come Sail Away\" by Styx. All activities that formed us into pretty deeply committed young socialists, ready at the age of 15 for the ultimate prize the movement could bestow, a summer living and working on a kibbutz, one of the collective farms that were a central part of settling the Jewish state."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"There, we would meet other members of the movement from all over the world and spend many a happy hour engaged in honest labor, laughingly baling sheaves of wheat, picking olives, oranges, peaches, grapes, the sweat on our brows a shining reminder of the nobility of collective farming. In the evenings, we would gather together and dance around the fire, sing Crosby, Stills, Nash, \u0026 Young songs and, if one\u0027s older siblings were any indication, lose our virginity. Years later, we would renounce our bourgeois upbringings and return to Israel, making lives of simple, agrarian bliss. This would all change for me in one single evening, in a shed of 5,000 chickens."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"The kibbutz I was assigned to was one of the oldest in Israel, settled in 1928 by Jews from Russia, Poland, and Germany. For the most part, our arrival was met with little to no notice. We were just another group of volunteers, no different from the countless other Europeans and Australians just passing through, taking time out to pick fruit, work on their tans, and contract cystitis from their rampant and unchecked coitus. But we were different. We were members of the movement."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I thought that our political ardor would be immediately apparent. I had visions of our bus being greeted by garlanded, folk-dancing youth, so happy to have us there to share in their dream. I had been raised on a fairly steady diet of just such socialist, utopian Ziegfeld numbers, songs, film strips, and oral histories that all attested to just this scenario."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Trees weren\u0027t simply trees. They were jungle gyms of plenty, with smiling children clambering over their branches. A field was somewhere you brought your guitar, so that your comrades could dance down the rows after the day\u0027s work was over."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I was assigned to pick pears. Work would begin at 4:00 AM and finish sometime mid-morning, before the heat had set in. How filled with fervor I was that first morning, the light barely dawning as I headed out in the back of the truck, wearing my simple work shirt, a pair of shorts, and the traditional sun hat worn by so many pioneers who had come before me to make the desert bloom. I should pause here to point out that we actually said things like \"make the desert bloom,\" all the time. So off I headed to the orchard."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I know I sound like the Central Casting New Yorker I\u0027ve turned myself into with single-minded determination when I say this, but the main problem with working in the fields is that the sun is just always shining. Dyed-in-the-wool Northerner that I am, it became apparent after about two days that I was completely unsuited to working outside. And I was moved around among the kibbutz\u0027s various interior jobs, the furniture factory, the metal irrigation parts factory, and the kitchen, assured all the while by the group leader that there was nothing emasculating or ersatz socialist in being moved inside. After all, each according to his needs, each according to his abilities. My abilities seemed to lie in passing out from heat stroke after a scant two hours in an orchard."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"This continued for weeks. It was a somewhat idyllic, if not a mite monotonous existence, that is, until the long night of the chickens. The boys of our group were gathered together one day and told in the hushed tones reserved for trying to avert impending disaster that we would forgo our regular work details and spend the night from midnight until dawn packing truckloads of poultry."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Why this needed to be done with such urgent secrecy under cover of night and why the girls were excused was never explained to us. And we didn\u0027t ask. We greeted the news with the respectful Hemingway silence of the Y chromosome, no dopey girls allowed. It was all imbued with nocturnal, testicular melodrama, like some summer stock production of Das Boot."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"We slept that evening from 9:00 to 11:00, what I would come to know later, in a far different context, as a disco nap. We rose, drank some tea. The girls sprayed perfume into some handkerchiefs for us to wear around our noses and mouths. And we were off in trucks to do battle with the insurgent chickens. The scene had everything but the diner waitress standing in the road watching us go, worriedly wiping her hands on her gingham apron."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"The chicken coop of the kibbutz was a one-storied structure of corrugated iron, about half the size of a football field. It emitted a low rumbling, a vague buzz that you could hear from far away. And of course from even farther away, there was the smell, a smell of such head-kicking intensity as to make a perfume-sprayed handkerchief almost adorable in its valiant naivete, Wile E. Coyote warding off a falling boulder with his paper parasol. And the combination of floral scent and dung merely increased the vileness."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Chicken [BLEEP] is horrible stuff. Unlike cow manure, which according to David Foster Wallace, smells \"warm and herbal and blameless,\" chicken [BLEEP] is an olfactory insult, a snarling, saw-toothed, ammoniac, cheesy smell, needlessly, gratuitously disgusting, a stench of such assaultive tenacity that it burns your eyes. Rather than making you never want to eat a chicken again, it simply makes you angry. It makes you hold a grudge. You\u0027ll eat chicken again, by god, and you\u0027ll chew really, really hard."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"One of the barrel-chested Israelis shows us what to do. Pick up four chickens in each hand. This is done by grabbing hold of the birds by one leg. \"If the leg snaps,\" he says, \"it doesn\u0027t matter, just to get four in each hand. B\u0027seder?\" he says. OK?"},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"He faces us, holding the requisite eight, four in each hand, living masses of writhing feathers. He looks like some German expressionist cheerleader, his pom-poms alive, convulsing, filthy. \"Who will see their dreams fall away into the abyss and eventually succumb to the crushing sadness and meaninglessness of it all? We will. And what does that spell? Madness. Louder. I can\u0027t hear you.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"He crams the chickens roughly into a blue plastic crate smeared with wet guano. \"And you close the lid, and tchick tchack,\" he tells us, clapping his hands with \"that\u0027s that\" finality. Before I even try, I know that I will not be able to do this. It is midnight, and we will be here until dawn, or until the truck is piled to capacity with crated birds."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I walk out into the sea of chickens. I reach down and grab one, its leg a slightly thicker, segmented chopstick. I recoil and stand up. I take a fetid breath, regroup, and bend down with new resolve, grab the chicken by its body with both hands, thinking somehow that might be preferable. Although how I think I\u0027m going to get eight of them this way, I\u0027m not sure. Its ribs expand and contract under my fingers, a dirty, warm, live umbrella. I drop the bird as if it were boiling hot."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"I leave the coop and go out to the trucks. Hoisting myself up onto the flatbed, I start to help with the stacking of the full crates. I know that my unilateral decision to change my task is met with displeasure on the part of the men who run the coop, but I do not care. Their muttered comments are predicated on a direct poultry-penile relationship. I might as well have spurned the stag party whore or gone to the woodshop and fashioned myself a sign that said \"fag.\" \"Ma ito? What\u0027s the matter with him,\" the head of the work detail asks when he sees me on the truck."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"[SPEAKING HEBREW], he is answered, using the female pronoun when referring to me. \"The lady doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"It would be years before I was referred to as \"she\" again, and then very rarely and only as a joke by friends. I turn around to look at the man, making it quite clear to him that I understand what they are saying. The man who called me \"she\" avoids my eyes and busies himself with straightening a pile of crates and tightening the tarpaulin on the side of the truck. \"You\u0027re right,\" I tell him in Hebrew. \"She doesn\u0027t like the chickens.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Have you ever had one of those moments when you know that you are being visited by your own future? They come so rarely and with so little fanfare, those moments. They\u0027re not particularly photogenic. There\u0027s no breach in the clouds to reveal the shining city on a hill, no folk-dancing children outside your bus, no production values to speak of, just a glimpse of such quotidian, incontrovertible truth that after the initial shock at the supreme weirdness of it all, a kind of calm sets in. So this is to be my life."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"At that very moment, I saw that I would never live on a kibbutz. I would not lose my virginity that summer to any of the girls from the group. Indeed, I would not care to do so. I am grateful to that macho blowhard. He made me consciously realize what I had always known but been somehow unable to say to myself. He\u0027s right. I don\u0027t like chickens. I like men."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Now, I live in Manhattan, the un-kibbutz, where nobody would dream of touching a live chicken, where whatever spirit of collectivist altruism people might have had dried up long ago. At camp, when I was young, I and the other children of affluent professionals would gather under the trees every day to sing before going into lunch. One of the songs was always \"The Internationale,\" the hymn of the proletariat. One summer, we were even taught to sing it with our left fists raised."},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"We were, none of us, by any stretch of the imagination, what could be described as prisoners of starvation, wretched of the earth, or enthralled slaves. Admittedly, they are all catchier metaphors and easier to scan than, \"Arise, ye children of psychiatrists,\" but they had little to nothing to do with us personally. And yet, for those few moments when we were singing, those words seemed so true. How can I describe to you that 11-year-old\u0027s sense of purpose, that thrill of belonging to something larger, something outside of my own body, the sheer heart-stopping beauty of a world of justice and perfection rising on new foundations. And that one line, \"We have been naught. We shall be all.\""},{"speakerName":"David Rakoff","text":"Naught. It spoke as much about my wish to be delivered from this pre-adolescent self-loathing as it did to any consciousness of liberating the masses. But it held such promise of what I might hope for that even now, as I write this, I can still call up that old fervor. It still makes my breath catch in my throat."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"David Rakoff\u0027s a writer in New York."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, our program was produced today by Alix Spiegel and myself with Nancy Updike and Julie Snyder, contributing editors Paul Tough, Jack Hitt, Margy Rochlin, and Consigliere Sarah Vowell.
