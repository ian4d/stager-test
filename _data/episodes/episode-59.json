That\u0027s the trick with fire, for that 30 seconds you have a choice, spit on it, step on it, douse it with a can of Coke. But wait one moment too long, get caught up in its beauty, and it\u0027s grown beyond your control. And it is that moment that I live for, the relinquishing. The power passes from you to it. The world opens up and you with it. I cried in the record store when the flame rose above my head, not from fear, but from ecstasy.\""

And we decided to start a fire in the house one night. We went there. We pried the boards off-- the house had been boarded up-- we pried the boards off, climbed in the window, and lit it on fire, and then climbed out the window and took off."

        "That\u0027s right. And we have, essentially, particularly in cities, people\u0027s contact with fire is almost always negative. A city is not a nice habitat for fire. It occurs in wild forms, it\u0027s dangerous.",
        "So people used to grow up-- if you were in a rural setting, you grew up burning off debris in the spring, burning off your fallow fields, burning off the pastures to get rid of the old grass and start the new, all kinds of little sort of spring cleaning fires, if you will, and fires for other purposes.",
        "But it seems to me all that kind of personal contact with fire is gone, and what we have largely left is a kind of imagery, a kind of virtual fire-- fires as presented for their telegenic effect, or fires used to dramatize other phenomenon. And in almost every case, the fire is negative.",
        "Blowing things up, and, at least, there is a more benevolent and ancient image in the last of it, where you have the funeral pyre for Darth Vader. But in general, you\u0027re right. Almost anything you can think of now, fire is used to sort of give visual and dramatic power to the story.",
        "I think we\u0027re allowing that to remain unchallenged, because in our personal sense, we don\u0027t have a sense of fire as a good force, fire as a useful tool, fire as something that makes the world habitable.",
        "Well, I would just like to see hearth fires. I would like to see some agricultural fires. I would like to see the Forest Service pair Smokey Bear with a complementary figure-- Smokey\u0027s twin brother, separated at birth or something, and he\u0027s there with a drip torch, and now they\u0027re together again, arm in arm, a paired set. That\u0027s the way it should be.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it\u0027s not designed for urban environments, but I would like to have it in our consciousness that such things are possible.",
        "Well, I would like to see us first intellectually embrace it, and recognize that it is really part of our heritage as a species. We have a species monopoly over it. And to sort of renounce that seems to me very strange.",
        "That\u0027s right. And I\u0027m sure we will never allow any other species.",
        "I think we\u0027re in big, big trouble. I mean, our whole premise is that we control it.",
        "Well, suddenly, the whole thing comes undone.",
        "Actually I\u0027ve written a novel on this. And it was a real mess, because I\u0027m not trained to write novels, but the premise seems to me a legitimate one to think about. I mean, maybe we\u0027ve done such a bad job as a species that nature finally turns the task over to somebody else who can do it right.",
        "That\u0027s a very recent and, in some ways, a bizarre perception. There are good reasons to be afraid of fire. It\u0027s dangerous. It can be unpredictable. But people have always paired that perception of fire with the sense that it was necessary, essential, that it\u0027s what made the world habitable.",
        "I mean, if you think about fire origin myths, and all cultures have them, almost always the story goes that humans are sort of a less capable or less well endowed species, then, through various means, usually by guile or theft, humans get it, or are given it, and then become powerful. Then, in a sense, they become human, and the essential features of who we are become apparent.",
        "I mean, in many ways, we really are the keepers of the planetary flame. And the sense that somehow, if we could abolish fire, it would be in our interest or the earth\u0027s interest, is a very peculiar and very modern, and urban, one.",
        "Well, we\u0027re talking about almost every society other than, basically, an urban and industrial one. And industrial societies have sort of sublimated fire into machines, and we\u0027re not burning living biomass so much as fossil fuels, fossil biomass."

        "The serious stuff came when I went to college. There was a house on campus that got hit by a truck, by a drunk driver, and the rumor was that the house was going to be scheduled for demolition. So my friends and I decided that, since it was scheduled for demolition, they were going to tear it down anyway, that there wouldn\u0027t be much harm in setting the house on fire. And we decided to start a fire in the house one night. We went there. We pried the boards off-- the house had been boarded up-- we pried the boards off, climbed in the window, and lit it on fire, and then climbed out the window and took off.",
        "I was giddy with excitement. My whole body was just like-- it was tingling. And we stayed away for a good hour or so to make sure we weren\u0027t caught at the scene of the crime, but I do remember coming back and seeing the fire trucks there.",
        "There was this sense of disappointment because the fire had been put out before the whole house had burned down. I think the fire never really got out of the bedroom. So there was definitely a disappointment, because the whole house hadn\u0027t burned down, and that was our goal.",
        "And if I could have done things the way I would have chosen to, we would have set the house on fire, and we would have sat up on a little hill at a safe distance watching it, drinking beers and watching it consume itself. Watch it slowly start to build, and then peak, and then watch the house fall down, and the fire eventually go out, and everything just turn to ashes. That would have been the way I wanted things to happen.",
        "My interest in fire did stop fairly suddenly. A couple years ago, I think someone mentioned that I used to be a fire bug, and I realized that I wasn\u0027t fascinated by fire anymore. And I started wondering why that was, and I started thinking back and realizing that my fascination with fire ended right around the first time I got laid.",
        "And I was fascinated to find that, you know, that this was true. I was completely unaware of it at the time. It wasn\u0027t until like five or six years after it stopped that I looked back and realized that I had stopped playing with fire right around the time I started having sex. I think now I have a normal relationship with fire. I don\u0027t use fire to express myself anymore."

            "The serious stuff came when I went to college. There was a house on campus that got hit by a truck, by a drunk driver, and the rumor was that the house was going to be scheduled for demolition. So my friends and I decided that, since it was scheduled for demolition, they were going to tear it down anyway, that there wouldn\u0027t be much harm in setting the house on fire. And we decided to start a fire in the house one night. We went there.

But when the government finally came through for them and said, look, we\u0027re going to give you a chance to get out of here, and not only that, we\u0027re going to give you a chance to build a new house, and make yourselves whole. We\u0027re not just going to give you the, maybe, if you\u0027re lucky, the $10,000 your property\u0027s worth, so that you can actually go out and afford to build a new home on the market, that\u0027s pretty hard to pass up for most people."

They could talk till they\u0027re blue in the face about how we should get out of here because we are in danger from gases, from subsidences, from all these horrible elements, and that isn\u0027t true at all. If we didn\u0027t have any coal beneath us, Centralia would be right where it is, the entire community.",
            "Very, very few people moved out of this town because of the fire. I want to make that perfectly clear. The government came in with big bucks. A lot of the homes, their children had all left, they were raised. They were left with these white elephant big houses, a lot of them needed fixing, so they knew that where to make the most money was to sell your home to the government.",
            "I know one thing. There are people that moved out of this town that can\u0027t wait till we\u0027re all out, because then, and only then, will they have peace of mind. Because as long as there is someone left in Centralia as adamant and committed as we are here in this town, they will never have peace of mind on what they did. Because many, many of them knew that they were instrumental in having Centralia in the condition that we are now.",

That was the main thing, they would just stop being friendly, they would stop being neighborly. And that was your first indication that they had turned the other way.",

            "Act two, Centralia. This is the story of a town decimated by fire.",
            "The fire that led to the evacuation of Centralia began out on the edge of town in an abandoned strip mine pit in 1962. There are 30 underground mine fires like this burning around Pennsylvania right now. They can burn slowly, for years. Most don\u0027t endanger anybody. But Centralia\u0027s built over old coal mines, and the fear was that the fire would jump from mine to mine and end up under the center of town.",
            "I met with five of the remaining residents of Centralia-- one eighth of the town-- in the town council\u0027s meeting room. John Comarnisky, a science teacher at a nearby high school, was quick to pull up various government charts and reports that prove, he says, that the subterranean fire is not a danger to the town.",
            "Helen Womer says the reason the government has tried to convince the people of Centralia that their town is in danger and evacuated the town is because Centralia sits on as much as $3.2 billion-- that\u0027s billion-- worth of coal.",
            "They don\u0027t have a lot of hard evidence to prove this government conspiracy. No paper trail, no witnesses, no names they\u0027re willing to name on the record. But what they do seem to be entirely correct about is this-- in 35 years, the fire has not moved from the edge of town toward the center, and has not injured anyone.",
            "What seems to have happened in Centralia is this-- the fire burned for 19 years, and then in 1981 came one of those turning point, made for TV events that can take your average, ongoing, unextinguished subterranean fire, and turn it into a state-wide media circus.",
            "This is a video made by the state to brief its own policy makers on the history of the fire.",
            "Before the story hit the TV news, the big political fight in Centralia was townspeople trying to get the government to block the fire or put it out. After the story hit the TV news, the government declared there was no way to tell where the fire might go next. They decided to evacuate. Bill Clank, who headed the location effort, says it was the only reasonable decision. Twice the state tried to erect barriers to block the fire, he says, and twice it jumped the barriers.",
            "The government calculated that it would cost $42 million to buy everyone\u0027s home. The request was put into the federal government. Once people heard about the potential money, says Helen Womer, the town split. Lots of people were living in these old houses built by the coal companies decades before.",
            "Two community organizations faced off. One, to keep people in Centralia and the fire out; the other to sell out and get out. People in the other camp knew where Helen Womer stood. They would blow smoke in her face in public, throw their pass books at her when she worked her bank teller job. Somebody lit an M-80 firecracker on her lawn. Somebody else threw a cat at her.",
            "Lamar Mervine looks out the window of the municipal building at Locust and Centre Street, what used to be the middle of town.",
            "Did that happen to you?",
            "If you talk to former Centralia residents like Jerry Wasachanski, leaving town wasn\u0027t a grand betrayal, not at all. He says he had a heart attack, wanted to move into a house where he wouldn\u0027t have to shovel coal down in the basement into the furnace.",
            "He and several other former residents did confirm what Helen Womer told me, though, that he was never scared of the underground fire reaching his house, never scared of underground gases seeping up and killing him. Mostly, he says, he moved because of the great deal the government gave him for his old house.",
            "$55,000 on a $3,000 investment-- a 2,000% profit. Now Jerry lives with his son Rob, about a 10 minute drive from Centralia, in Mount Carmel, where lots of former Centralians live. Rob says they held out a long time before they moved, that Centralia changed.",
            "As with most government operations on the scale of this evacuation, there are really two ways that people look at what happened in Centralia. As a conspiracy, the way the remaining townspeople see it, or as simple human incompetence, the way Jerry\u0027s son Rob sees it.",
            "But all the guys who would have made the mistake, they\u0027re already probably gone now anyways. It was 20 years ago.",
            "They can\u0027t just say, fire moved, thought it was going to go this way, it went this way.",
            "Actually, there\u0027s a third way to view what happened in Centralia, the way that Bill Clank, head of the relocation effort, sees it, which is as a government program that actually worked. A rare example of government competence and generosity.",
            "In 1992, after a decade of voluntary relocation of the people from Centralia, the state condemned the remaining homes there, told everyone they had to get out, declared eminent domain. The mayor and town council back then took this to court. They appealed it all the way up to the US Supreme Court. They did not win one case.",
            "Then the town council back then resigned, left town, saying it was over. They\u0027d lost. Legally, no one has the right to stay in Centralia anymore. For the 40 diehards who still live there, like Helen Womer, these final departures were the bitterest betrayal.",
            "Grocery store?",
            "And does she live nearby still?",
            "So very close?",
            "But you\u0027re not social anymore?",
            "Now in the long stretch of grass that used to be the middle of town, someone put in some benches and a sign that says, we love Centralia. Jerry Wasaschinski and the other old men who left town because of the idea of a fire travel from their homes elsewhere, come back to Centralia, not for the town that it is, but for the idea of the town it was.",
            "So describe this now.",
            "Only one store now stands on Centre Street, vacant lots surround it. Perhaps two dozen homes are left out of the hundreds that used to be here. Centralia once had 3,000 people in it. Now there are 40. And the fire that decimated this town, that scattered its inhabitants far and wide, never touched a single home, never singed a building. This is a town destroyed by the idea of fire. And the fire itself never came."

            "Actually, as you describe this, I realized all of the movies, and all of the previews for movies I\u0027ve seen lately, where fire is a huge element in those movies. There\u0027s a whole sequence of movies out now where volcanoes set cities on fire. I was at one of the Star Wars movies, and one of the things that struck me was just how much of the movie was simply about blowing things up.",

            "And children would sometimes follow the example of Smokey the one who sets the fires, the other Smokey?",
            "We\u0027ve arrived at act four, as promised, The Big Picture. Stephen Pyne, a professor, believes that we Americans as a people, as a group, are too afraid of fire. And he says that this has all sorts of practical consequences. For example, in Yellowstone National Park, Pyne says the Forest Service policy of suppressing fires for the last 100 years out of fear of fire has led to an incredible overgrowth of flammable material, which caused the fires in 1988 that destroyed half the park. In other words, by trying to avoid fires, we called them down upon us.",

            "That\u0027s right. And we have, essentially, particularly in cities, people\u0027s contact with fire is almost always negative. A city is not a nice habitat for fire. It occurs in wild forms, it\u0027s dangerous.",
            "So people used to grow up-- if you were in a rural setting, you grew up burning off debris in the spring, burning off your fallow fields, burning off the pastures to get rid of the old grass and start the new, all kinds of little sort of spring cleaning fires, if you will, and fires for other purposes.",
            "But it seems to me all that kind of personal contact with fire is gone, and what we have largely left is a kind of imagery, a kind of virtual fire-- fires as presented for their telegenic effect, or fires used to dramatize other phenomenon. And in almost every case, the fire is negative.",
            "Blowing things up, and, at least, there is a more benevolent and ancient image in the last of it, where you have the funeral pyre for Darth Vader. But in general, you\u0027re right. Almost anything you can think of now, fire is used to sort of give visual and dramatic power to the story.",
            "I think we\u0027re allowing that to remain unchallenged, because in our personal sense, we don\u0027t have a sense of fire as a good force, fire as a useful tool, fire as something that makes the world habitable.",
            "Well, I would just like to see hearth fires. I would like to see some agricultural fires. I would like to see the Forest Service pair Smokey Bear with a complementary figure-- Smokey\u0027s twin brother, separated at birth or something, and he\u0027s there with a drip torch, and now they\u0027re together again, arm in arm, a paired set. That\u0027s the way it should be.",
            "Right.",
            "Well, it\u0027s not designed for urban environments, but I would like to have it in our consciousness that such things are possible.",
            "Well, I would like to see us first intellectually embrace it, and recognize that it is really part of our heritage as a species. We have a species monopoly over it. And to sort of renounce that seems to me very strange.",
            "That\u0027s right. And I\u0027m sure we will never allow any other species.",
            "I think we\u0027re in big, big trouble. I mean, our whole premise is that we control it.",
            "Well, suddenly, the whole thing comes undone.",
            "Actually I\u0027ve written a novel on this. And it was a real mess, because I\u0027m not trained to write novels, but the premise seems to me a legitimate one to think about. I mean, maybe we\u0027ve done such a bad job as a species that nature finally turns the task over to somebody else who can do it right.",
            "That\u0027s a very recent and, in some ways, a bizarre perception. There are good reasons to be afraid of fire. It\u0027s dangerous. It can be unpredictable. But people have always paired that perception of fire with the sense that it was necessary, essential, that it\u0027s what made the world habitable.",
            "I mean, if you think about fire origin myths, and all cultures have them, almost always the story goes that humans are sort of a less capable or less well endowed species, then, through various means, usually by guile or theft, humans get it, or are given it, and then become powerful. Then, in a sense, they become human, and the essential features of who we are become apparent.",
            "I mean, in many ways, we really are the keepers of the planetary flame. And the sense that somehow, if we could abolish fire, it would be in our interest or the earth\u0027s interest, is a very peculiar and very modern, and urban, one.",
            "Well, we\u0027re talking about almost every society other than, basically, an urban and industrial one. And industrial societies have sort of sublimated fire into machines, and we\u0027re not burning living biomass so much as fossil fuels, fossil biomass."

In other words, by trying to avoid fires, we called them down upon us."

            "Unfortunately, Steven was a man of many such theories. He insisted that light beer was 90% water, and that all TV networks were working together behind the scenes. He\u0027d flip up and down the 10 o\u0027clock news shows comparing anchor people, graphics, weather reports, until inevitably, he\u0027d hit two shows doing a special report on the same subject, or two networks airing the same commercial at the same time. \"See, look at this,\" he\u0027d yell at the screen. \"This is exactly what I\u0027m talking about.\"",
            "Steven parked so close to the dumpster, I had to crawl over the gear shift to his side to get out. We walked quickly up the alley to the street. Just as we turned onto our block, he grabbed my arm. \"Pat, have I died and gone to heaven? Am I having a stroke?\" A lone station wagon with wooden siding was pulling out a few feet ahead of us inch by inch, exposing pavement as dark as new tar and a gleaming white curb. The space hadn\u0027t seen sunlight in decades. It was like seeing a new $100 bill.",
            "I swallowed hard, sucking my cheeks in in excitement. \"Is that a spot or is that a spot?\" Steven was grinning so hard his face began to leap and twitch, his fingers flexing in and out against my arm, like a cat clawing a blanket. \"It\u0027s a spot, all right,\" I said. \"A big one. You want to bet on how many seconds before it\u0027s gone?\"",
            "\"Listen,\" he said in a quick whisper. \"Go stand in it while I get the car. Don\u0027t let anyone in, not anyone.\"",
            "\"Steven, you can\u0027t save spots by standing in them,\" I said. \"This isn\u0027t kindergarten. This is the kind of thing people get shot over.\"",
            "\"Just stand there. You\u0027ve got to stand somewhere, am I right?\" His voice reached a threatening pitch. Sweat was beaded up on his forehead. \"Pat, get in that spot.\"",
            "I stepped forward into the space, staring down at the indentations his burgundy loafers made in the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street. I curled my hands into firsts, and pressed my fingernails into my palms so hard I snapped off a nail. I felt like sobbing. These were acrylic nails that had cost a fortune at Lovely Lady, a nail salon by the lake. I forced my fingers out straight and dropped the broken nail, a flash of fluttering pink. Steven disappeared into the alley.",
            "A minute passed in silence. I detected the faint smell of something green lurking underneath the city air. I closed my eyes for a moment, imagining a perfect lawn, a cement patio, and golden retrievers in a wire mesh kennel.",
            "Headlights swept across me then, a car turning the corner, a big rumbling car, but behind the wheel, a delicate man so dwarfed by his car, I imagined him propped up on telephone books to reach the wheel. His window rolled down, his pushed his head out, carefully maneuvering a worn Cubs cap through the open window.",
            "He said something, but I couldn\u0027t quite catch it. His voice was high and thin, freakishly feminine.",
            "I was car sick from reading the Sun Times in the car, but I couldn\u0027t stop reading. There was an article wedged in next to a tight column of helpful household hints, right above Today\u0027s Chuckle. The article reported a study that proved that in emergency situations, people respond more seriously when someone screamed fire than when someone screamed help. Your average person just didn\u0027t respond to the word help anymore. The word had lost its punch.",
            "I stepped forward, but still I couldn\u0027t hear what the man was saying, even though I saw his neck straining, veins bulging as he raised his voice. I just couldn\u0027t quite catch it. Or at least, I hoped I hadn\u0027t, because what I thought he said was, \"Are you going to move, or do I have to run you over?\"",
            "I glanced toward the alley, no sign of Steven. The man lurched his car into park and lifted himself up so that half his torso came up out of the window. This time I heard him clearly. \"Are you trying to save that spot?\" He smiled at me. I looked down around me at the space and nodded. \"My husband is pulling up from the alley.\" We both turned, staring down the alley. Nothing.",
            "\"You think there\u0027s room for two?\" The man asked. I stared across the empty space, measuring car lengths with my eyes. This was just the kind of spatial relationship task I\u0027d done poorly at in school. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, \"I mean I guess.\" Before I could work on my reasoning, he smiled at me again. I sent him back a wide grin. He returned a soft, knowing stare.",
            "Just as the man pulled into the parking spot, and I saw with a jolt of fear that there was definitely not going to be room for two cars after all, our car appeared at the mouth of the alley with Steven hunched over the wheel.",
            "He looked at the spot being taken, looked at me, then squealed in reverse back down the alley. \"Was that your husband?\" The man asked. He was out of his car now. He had on a black t-shirt and shiny lycra bike pants. His arms and legs were pale and bony, and hung helplessly from his torso.",
            "\"He was here a minute ago,\" I said. \"He backed down into the alley. I guess he thought there wasn\u0027t room.\"",
            "\"Well, what kind of car does he drive?\" The man asked. \"A Nissan,\" I told him.",
            "\"Oh, he can fit. He can definitely fit. Go get him. I can move up further. I\u0027m sure of it.\" I had my doubts, but remembering our shared smiles, I moved up onto the sidewalk and cut across to the alley.",
            "Just as I stepped away from the spot, a car turned up the block, a Cadillac. I looked back. \"Go on,\" the man waved me forward. \"I\u0027ll save the spot. Besides,\" he lowered his voice, \"it\u0027s a Caddy. She\u0027ll never fit in a million years.\" I smiled. The man shot back a smirk. I headed down the alley.",
            "Steven was double parked next to the dumpster again. I knocked on the glass. He held his finger on the window button. The glass hummed down into the door.",
            "The study coordinator suggested that people should scream fire even when there was no fire. Below that article was a piece about how putting a brick in your toilet could eventually conserve enough water to fill a kiddy pool. I stopped reading then because my husband Steven was yelling at me.",
            "\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I told him. \"I thought there was room. That guy says he\u0027ll try and move up if you want to pull in again.\"",
            "\"No one,\" Steven said, his voice arcing up towards hysteria, \"on this entire planet, in any car, from any country, could fit into that spot. I\u0027m not going to embarrass any of us by trying.\"",
            "\"Well, what do you want to do then?\" I asked.",
            "\"OK, OK.\" He let out a long, theatrical burst of air. \"I\u0027ll go through the motions. Why not? Why don\u0027t we just sleep in the car tonight? Hook the TV to the dashboard and just wait for the police to show up in the morning.\" He stepped on the clutch, the skin around his eyes and mouth quivering violently.",
            "\"Go on,\" I yelled, \"you can do it.\" I turned and ran back up the street. Halfway there, Steven burst past me, motor roaring.",
            "When I turned the corner, the man was in his car, pushing it up against the bumper of the car in front of him. There was the squeal of metal rubbing against metal. The car in front moved up an inch or two, and then slammed into the back bumper of the next car up. The man turned the car off, jumped out, smiling. He\u0027d created at most another four or five inches of space.",
            "Meanwhile, Steven had pulled halfway into the spot and pulled back out again. Finally, he screeched off again down into the alley for the third time.",
            "The man and I stood in silence on the sidewalk as a Honda came around the corner and glided smoothly into the spot. Two girls jumped out. \"Marla\u0027s apartment is that way,\" one of them said to the other. \"She\u0027s got this new futon couch and faux marble.\" I caught their perfume in the air as they clicked away down the sidewalk, something between watermelon and lilies.",
            "Steven said faux was for wimps. He liked earth tones. Everything had to be earth tones, so that our apartment ended up looking like a pile of dirt.",
            "I walked down the alley. Steven was bent over the trunk of the car, pushing down hard enough to make the car bounce. \"Damn this trunk,\" he said. \"It\u0027s never worked right since we were broken into.\"",
            "He was trying to yell at me and park the car at the same time. It was too much for him. That was obvious. He was yelling things like, \"You know I told you,\" and, \"God dammit, what did I say?\" You could tell he was thinking about too many things at once, and nothing was getting done right.",
            "\"I\u0027m sorry I gave away our spot,\" I said. \"I knew in a second we wouldn\u0027t fit,\" he snapped. \"Not in a million years.\" He lunged one last time onto the trunk and it clicked painfully into the lock.",
            "\"I shouldn\u0027t have done it,\" I said. \"I know that now.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter, Pat,\" he said, turning to face me, resting his weight against the car. \"What\u0027s one more ticket at this point? We might as well start parking in bus stops and handicap zones.\"",
            "There were footsteps behind us. It was the man who\u0027d taken our spot. He stood a moment, staring at us, pushing his shirt down into his bike pants. \"Your car is big for a Nissan,\" he said finally. \"Yeah,\" Steven said, \"and heavy. Burns a lot of oil.\"",
            "\"I\u0027m sorry I took your spot,\" the man said. \"My car is bigger than I thought. Do you live here?\" He pointed to our building. We nodded. \"I just moved in,\" he said. \"Last week during the storm.\"",
            "We headed up the alley and around to the front courtyard, the man talking as we walked, following a step behind. \"I just moved in, like I said, and already I can\u0027t take the noise.\"",
            "I held the gate open, and then the three of us were standing in the courtyard. We stopped, surrounded by our building on three sides, and behind us, the street. High above us, the third floor maybe, someone was practicing a clarinet, and in one of the open windows on the first floor I could hear a woman talking softly. \"That\u0027s a good kitty. Mama loves a good baby kitty.\"",
            "\"Do you have a problem with the noise?\" The man asked. \"Sure,\" Steven said, \"everybody does.\" \"Frankly,\" the man said, \"I don\u0027t know if I can take it. The woman above me walks back and forth all night long. That\u0027s not normal in my book.\" \"You should talk to her,\" I offered.",
            "We were standing in a circle, but suddenly, as if he\u0027d made a decision, the man stepped forward towards Steven, putting his back to me. He kept talking.",
            "\"I went up there twice already, and she said she\u0027s going to call the police on me. \u0027Fine,\u0027 I told her. It\u0027s my peace being disturbed, not hers.\"",
            "\"Get a broom,\" Steven said. \"I\u0027ve used a broom.\" \"What?\" The man said, stepping closer. \"On the ceiling,\" Steven explained. \"Oh, so you do have noisy neighbors,\" the man said, excited. \"We did.\" Steven told him. \"They were old people, banging around in wheelchairs all day, then the man died. That ended it.\"",
            "We\u0027d been driving around and around the cramped streets of Lincoln Park for over 40 minutes, searching for a spot. \"Reading that junk is just wasting brain cells,\" he said. \"You might as well sit an inch away from the TV.\" \"Traffic makes me nervous, it helps if I read,\" I told him. \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re not driving.\"",
            "\"You mean the woman quieted down without him?\" The man asked, thrusting in front of me so I had to take a step back against the wall of the building. \"Oh no,\" Steven said, \"nothing like that.\"",
            "\"Well, like I say, I just moved in,\" the man said, interrupting. His voice was growing hoarse. \"And I have friends on Bryer, you know, right around the corner. They have parking there, but you have to pay, and the waiting list is so long you practically have to kill someone to move up.\" His voice sped up. \"The indoor\u0027s more expensive, but not so much, really, I mean, you have to realize outdoor is crazy. You\u0027re getting no protection at all. Zip.\"",
            "He caught his breath and stepped back onto my foot. I slid along the bricks, out of his way. \"You know,\" he continued, \"I don\u0027t know too many people around here, but I\u0027m making it a point to tell everyone I meet, my friends on Bryer tell me someone was robbed at gunpoint in the lobby the other night. I mean, the only reason I\u0027m telling you this is that they\u0027re right around the corner, and if you look, they have the same kind of lobby we do. You know, an outer door, and then mailboxes, and then a locked door. They wait for you to come get your mail. I don\u0027t want to ruin your night, but robbed at gunpoint, that\u0027s the worst, isn\u0027t it?\"",
            "I looked up at the sky. A helicopter was clicking past in the darkness. It was one of those questions, would you rather be burned to death, or frozen?",
            "\"That\u0027s why I always carry $10 in my wallet,\" Steven said. \"What do you mean?\" The man asked, stepping forward now, towards Steven. \"I haven\u0027t heard this one.\" \"$10 is usually enough they won\u0027t shoot,\" Steven said. \"They just want something.\" He spoke slowly, his face luminescent under the street lights.",
            "I stepped forward, trying to catch Steven\u0027s gaze over the man\u0027s shoulders. \"I just read something I think you\u0027ll both find interesting,\" I said. My voice sounded raw and crazy. They turned. Steven\u0027s arm was blocking his chest, the man swivelling around on the point of one toe.",
            "\"Actually, it\u0027s right along this vein of conversation,\" I said, pausing for breath, trying to think how Steven might tell it. \"They say,\" I said, voice rising up high, \"that is, the professionals, that when you\u0027re attacked, you should never scream, \u0027help,\u0027 because nobody listens. No one takes that word seriously anymore.\"",
            "\"Is this a joke?\" The man asked. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve heard this one. My roommate has a book of 1,000 space shuttle jokes. I mean, get a life, right?\" Steven was staring at me as if I had completely broken with reality. Gypsy moths beat their wings noisily against the shining lamps over the doorway. The clarinet player had stopped. I felt like the whole building was silent, waiting.",
            "\"They have statistics that prove this, that in an emergency,\" I was gasping for air now, \"it seems more people listen when you scream, \u0027fire,\u0027 even when there is no actual fire.\"",
            "Steven\u0027s face was bright red, a vein pulsing in the center of his forehead. Suddenly the man spoke. \"Fire?\" He asked, \"do I have this right?\"",
            "We\u0027d been going back and forth like this ever since he picked me up after work. He was mad because I hadn\u0027t asked my boss for a raise. My annual review had come and gone and I hadn\u0027t, as he put it, made my move. Steven, on the other hand, had pulled a 20% raise out of his review, plus an office with a window. A major move up, he termed it, a personal best.",
            "We stepped forward in unison, Steven and I, almost swallowing the man up. \"Fire,\" we said, at precisely the same moment, with precisely the same inflection. I felt my insides leap up. Steven\u0027s eyes flashed to mine.",
            "He was disgusted with me and the tiny cubicle in which I spent my days shuffling data, without any attempt at advancement. He\u0027d wasted weeks before my review date, giving me pep talks to boost what he termed my corporate competitiveness. \"You either step up, Pat,\" he said, \"or you get stepped over. It\u0027s that simple. Let them know you\u0027re on the move. Walk faster down hallways. Make quality eye contact.\"",
            "Judging from the way I\u0027d silently nodded yes, yes, yes, to every new criticism my boss had cited as reasons for giving me only a cost of living increase, I hadn\u0027t managed much of a killer instinct. My secret dream, to breed golden retrievers out on two acres in the suburbs, seemed to be moving further and further away.",
            "Steven turned the car into the alley behind our building. This was the sign that we were giving up our parking search for the day. He backed us in next to a dumpster surrounded by no parking signs and broken glass. We already had 15 outstanding $100 tickets from parking in this alley. 10 was the suggested limit before they towed, but Steven refused to take mass transit. He had a system. Every time he parked the car, he turned the wheels as far to the right as they\u0027d go. He was convinced this made it impossible for the car to be towed."
