Or the kind of thuggy Jesus with the hooded eyes like Robert Mitchum. Or the Jesus you want to make biscuits for. Or the Jesus you want to wrestle with. Or the Catholic Jesus.

He said, \"Don\u0027t you ever even worry about keeping that beat. You just let that beat keep you.\" I pretty much knew what was going to happen with the boys if I let that beat keep me, and I wasn\u0027t all that surprised that Jesus wanted me to go all the way.

And we sat in the movie next to each other, and he didn\u0027t make a move. And nothing happened. And then his father came and picked us up and drove us back to his house.",
        "So he said, \"Do you want to come up to my room?\" And as we went into his room, he closed the door and said, \"We\u0027re not allowed to lock our doors in my house.\" So otherwise he would have locked the door.",
        "This is really hard.",
        "So I don\u0027t know. He roamed around and was showing me stuff, and I was just being sort of polite. And showing me all his toys and junk and silly things that he had, and then proceeded to make the moves, make the big moves on me. And I was just very innocent. And he was very aggressive and just started kissing me and then just said, \"Take off your shirt.\"",
        "And so I\u0027m sitting there thinking, well, the door is unlocked. And he said, \"Well, you know--\" And he had a little sister who was pestering us.",
        "So eventually I said, [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] And he\u0027s like, \"Oh, no.\" And asks me do I want to see it. I did. And of course, I want to see it. I mean, I want to know what it looks like. But at the same time, I feel like I\u0027m in this incredibly ominous-- this is a dangerous situation. It\u0027s pornographic. Now I know how much of a little girl I was. I was just 13. I mean, 13 is young.",
        "But there it was, it was this mindless thing. And I thought, well [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] --I want to see it jump, this is what I have to do."

        "[MUSIC - BY JO CAROL PIERCE AND BAND]",
        "I got in a world of trouble going from Secret Dan to Secret Dan. I got a bad reputation in my peer group. Lots of my friends were getting married, and when they did, they would just drop me flat. And my friends that weren\u0027t real mad at me were real worried about me. And everybody was discouraging me from falling in love. They said, Jo Carol, why don\u0027t you do something you\u0027re good at?",
        "So I tried to explain to them why I had to do these very upsetting things. I said, look, the reason that I cannot pass up a single Secret Dan is that each one of them is just another side of Jesus. And I know that because every time I kiss another one, I can feel Jesus right through his skin. And I need to know Jesus fully. Jesus in a brown leather jacket. Or the kind of thuggy Jesus with the hooded eyes like Robert Mitchum. Or the Jesus you want to make biscuits for. Or the Jesus you want to wrestle with. Or the Catholic Jesus. Or the Jesus who\u0027s so good in bed you think he\u0027s Catholic, but really he\u0027s not. There was even a Yankee Jesus.",
        "And my friends said, nuh-uh. But I could tell my friends were upset by the truth, because they\u0027d go off in small groups and whisper. And every once in a while I would hear this phrase, \"mental hospital.\" And it made me nervous, so I got married. And when my husband slipped that golden wedding ring on my finger, it was the first time I\u0027d ever strayed off of that spiritual path that Jesus had set out for me so specifically years before.",
        "It was back in high school. One sunny night I was out jumping bar ditches in my parents\u0027 car when it overheated and stalled and left me stranded out there on the Idalou highway. I didn\u0027t know what I was going to do until this darling boy named Joey came along in his shiny truck, and he fixed my car on the spot. And then he witnessed to me about Jesus. It was his Highway Witness for Jesus Program.",
        "And he was so darling that I just went to church with him that night. I liked sitting next to him so much, and before I knew what I was doing, I had grabbed his hand. He jerked and turned pale, but he did not get up and move. His heart was beating just like a hammer in the palm of his hand, and it was pounding home the sermon about the burning bush and the tongues of flame like never before. And I knew I had to keep that beat forever and ever.",
        "And then we watched the preacher baptize Naomi [? Stutler. ?] And maybe it was the way her back arched when he pulled her up out of the water, or maybe it was the way that white robe clung to her body that inspired me to the point that I knew Jesus in my heart for the very first time, because he said something right in my ear. He said, \"Don\u0027t you ever even worry about keeping that beat. You just let that beat keep you.\" I pretty much knew what was going to happen with the boys if I let that beat keep me, and I wasn\u0027t all that surprised that Jesus wanted me to go all the way. Because, after all, he did.",
        "I took my first step on my new spiritual path that evening after church when I suggested to Joey that we park at a prairie dog camp and discuss Jesus a little further. Later on, Joey was real disappointed in himself for what happened out there, but I wasn\u0027t. My new spiritual path was just like walking on cloud nine.",
        "I didn\u0027t hear from Joey for quite a while, but I didn\u0027t think anything about it. Because I had asked my question, what are these boys for, and what am I supposed to do with them in the plural. And it had been answered in the plural. And so I was real busy. But one evening Joey threw pebbles at my window, and I sneaked out behind the playhouse to meet him. And I found out why I had not heard from him was he had been saving up to buy me something very special.",
        "But unfortunately, the day he got it out of layaway was the very--",
        "Oh god, I am so relieved. I was afraid I had made that whole thing up in my head and was turning out to be crazy like Mama. Because, see, what happened was I drove up, Buddy [? Grays ?] gives me my change and my chili dog. And I just sit there waiting for something to happen. And finally I say, \"Buddy.\" He says, \"What?\" He says, \"Hi.\" He says, \"Hi.\" And I drove off feeling like I wasn\u0027t even in this world. I am so relieved somebody besides me thinks that happened.",
        "Well, sometimes I get real bored.",
        "Now, wait, Joey. What did I ever do to you?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, Joey, I am just sick I ruined your senior year. But how did I do it exactly?",
        "Oh, Joey, that is so pretty. Bless your heart, it really is.",
        "Look how it sparkles almost like a genuine diamond. If I wore this, people might think it was really real.",
        "[SINGING] This diamond is really real, Joey.",
        "[SINGING] Do you really wanna marry me?",
        "[SINGING] Oh, Joey, how did it come to this? I\u0027m so depressed.",
        "Oh, you could call it a whole lot of things. Like if you\u0027re trying to be--",
        "[SINGING] I\u0027m so flattered, I can\u0027t tell you. But Jesus has another plan for me. And, Joey, it\u0027ll be better for you, too. Some day you\u0027re gonna thank me for all the girls you would have missed and never kissed if I said yes.",
        "Well, that too, yes.",
        "Me and my boyfriend were driving around the loop, and we were having a terrible fight. I remember that he called me a son of a bitch. And that confused me, so I opened the passenger door and flung myself into traffic. First, I was hit by a pink Coupe de Ville, knocked me into the path of an out of state semi and just squished me flat into that burning asphalt.",
        "[SINGING] So it really has to be goodbye?",
        "[SINGING] One more time to remember me by?",
        "[SINGING] One more time so I\u0027ll remember, too.",
        "Joey, do you take me for a fool? I know you do.",
        "But after I had committed suicide, I started seeing things in a whole new light. I noticed what a cute boy my boyfriend was. Couldn\u0027t understand why I\u0027d been calling him a decorated rat only moments before my fatal plunge. I took his hand. It was chaffed and slightly smaller than mine. We went home, and I made him some biscuits and gravy from scratch, because I really wanted to.",
        "It\u0027s good to commit suicide when there\u0027s something you just can\u0027t figure out. Like when I hit high school and I found out you\u0027re a bitch if you don\u0027t and a whore if you do. Commit suicide when you\u0027ve got a burning question that no one can answer for you. Mine was, what are these boys for, and what am I supposed to do with them? Don\u0027t get upset about the war in the Middle East. Do something. Kill yourself.",
        "It\u0027s good to commit suicide over small things that other people might neglect, like grocery shopping. I can\u0027t imagine walking into that ATB without first committing suicide. Think about it. Commit suicide first thing in the morning. And that way, you feel better all day. Do it your first day on a new job, and the next day you can call in dead. Do it early in a love affair and just get it over with.",
        "That\u0027s why me and the boys are going to commit suicide right now. We hope that you will join us. Just start getting really pitiful and morose, and in the third verse, we will slit our wrists."

            "All right, now this moment from the life of a teenage girl in these United States.",
            "So, Kara, do you have a favorite piece in the Rollins show?",
            "She pulls out the papers that comprise the show\u0027s script, and she reads to me. And I should say here that Rollins and our 18-year-old teenager get rather graphic here in a way that might not be suitable for younger listeners. Rollins, in this poem, says that guys are basically scum. Basically just scum. His vision is very unambiguous. They\u0027re scum. And he gives heartfelt advice to all women who he addresses as \"ladies.\"",
            "The guys in the group all look at each other. Finally, Kara\u0027s boyfriend, Jeremy, says, \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with a guy looking at you and thinking how good you look.\" Kara tells him that isn\u0027t the point.",
            "School has just let out. Perfect spring day. Kara and her boyfriend, Jeremy, come outside, and he jumps on her back.",
            "Kara tells him a story about some guy who was staring at her in a pool hall.",
            "Mary\u0027s boyfriend, Aaron, has joined the conversation. \"So how should we treat girls?\" He asks. \"If we like a girl, how do we let her know without offending her?\"",
            "They talk about this for 20 minutes. The boys ask over and over, what should we do? What do you want us to do? How should we act? And over and over, the girls name a few simple rules that anyone could follow if they pay attention. One, do not invade a girl\u0027s personal space. Two, don\u0027t say anything rude. Aaron says that certain things are only seen as rude if the girl doesn\u0027t like you. If she thinks you\u0027re cute, then they\u0027re OK.",
            "What\u0027s striking is that there are certain moments when it actually seems like the boys really do want to know how they should act. They really want to know. And in those moments it\u0027s clear that this conversation could only happen in high school. After high school, everyone\u0027s opinion about these questions is pretty much set. But in high school, sometimes there\u0027s still a feeling that everything\u0027s up for grabs. So you can tell your boyfriend not to be a jerk, and he might actually listen.",
            "That\u0027s a good side of everything being up for grabs. There\u0027s also a bad side. With everything up for grabs, it\u0027s hard to know how you\u0027re supposed to act. Which brings us to today\u0027s program.",
            "Our program today is made up of three stories about teenage girls who have to decide how they\u0027re going to act in situations where the ground rules are unclear and very malleable. Act One of our program, Jo Carol Pierce bends the rules in a small town in Texas.",
            "Act Two, Chicago writer Rennie Sparks struggles without rules in suburban America, somewhere.",
            "Act Three, a man tries to lay down rules for a girl. Stay with us.",
            "",
            "When I recorded this, I\u0027d been doing documentary radio stories on Kara and her friends for two years. So it was natural that at this point, Kara would just turn to me and say--",
            "Well, today on our program, the lives of teenage girls. From WBEZ Chicago, you\u0027re listening to This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass, back for another week, to kick your butt. Not really. Back for another week documenting everyday stories of these United States using all the tools of radio storytelling-- documentaries, monologues, overheard conversations, found tapes, anything we can think of.",
            "And to consider the question of what it\u0027s like to be a teenager in America today, consider this incident between Kara and Jeremy and their friends. They had just come outside after a rehearsal for a school play that Kara is putting together based on the writings of Henry Rollins. And if you don\u0027t know his work, Henry Rollins is a pop star. He plays this sort of testosterone-loaded post-punk rock. And at the time of this recording, he was Kara\u0027s favorite writer."

            "[MUSIC - BY JO CAROL PIERCE AND BAND]",
            "I got in a world of trouble going from Secret Dan to Secret Dan. I got a bad reputation in my peer group. Lots of my friends were getting married, and when they did, they would just drop me flat. And my friends that weren\u0027t real mad at me were real worried about me. And everybody was discouraging me from falling in love. They said, Jo Carol, why don\u0027t you do something you\u0027re good at?",
            "So I tried to explain to them why I had to do these very upsetting things. I said, look, the reason that I cannot pass up a single Secret Dan is that each one of them is just another side of Jesus. And I know that because every time I kiss another one, I can feel Jesus right through his skin. And I need to know Jesus fully. Jesus in a brown leather jacket. Or the kind of thuggy Jesus with the hooded eyes like Robert Mitchum. Or the Jesus you want to make biscuits for. Or the Jesus you want to wrestle with. Or the Catholic Jesus. Or the Jesus who\u0027s so good in bed you think he\u0027s Catholic, but really he\u0027s not. There was even a Yankee Jesus.",
            "And my friends said, nuh-uh. But I could tell my friends were upset by the truth, because they\u0027d go off in small groups and whisper. And every once in a while I would hear this phrase, \"mental hospital.\" And it made me nervous, so I got married. And when my husband slipped that golden wedding ring on my finger, it was the first time I\u0027d ever strayed off of that spiritual path that Jesus had set out for me so specifically years before.",
            "It was back in high school. One sunny night I was out jumping bar ditches in my parents\u0027 car when it overheated and stalled and left me stranded out there on the Idalou highway. I didn\u0027t know what I was going to do until this darling boy named Joey came along in his shiny truck, and he fixed my car on the spot. And then he witnessed to me about Jesus. It was his Highway Witness for Jesus Program.",
            "And he was so darling that I just went to church with him that night. I liked sitting next to him so much, and before I knew what I was doing, I had grabbed his hand. He jerked and turned pale, but he did not get up and move. His heart was beating just like a hammer in the palm of his hand, and it was pounding home the sermon about the burning bush and the tongues of flame like never before. And I knew I had to keep that beat forever and ever.",
            "And then we watched the preacher baptize Naomi [? Stutler. ?] And maybe it was the way her back arched when he pulled her up out of the water, or maybe it was the way that white robe clung to her body that inspired me to the point that I knew Jesus in my heart for the very first time, because he said something right in my ear. He said, \"Don\u0027t you ever even worry about keeping that beat. You just let that beat keep you.\" I pretty much knew what was going to happen with the boys if I let that beat keep me, and I wasn\u0027t all that surprised that Jesus wanted me to go all the way. Because, after all, he did.",
            "I took my first step on my new spiritual path that evening after church when I suggested to Joey that we park at a prairie dog camp and discuss Jesus a little further. Later on, Joey was real disappointed in himself for what happened out there, but I wasn\u0027t. My new spiritual path was just like walking on cloud nine.",
            "I didn\u0027t hear from Joey for quite a while, but I didn\u0027t think anything about it. Because I had asked my question, what are these boys for, and what am I supposed to do with them in the plural. And it had been answered in the plural. And so I was real busy. But one evening Joey threw pebbles at my window, and I sneaked out behind the playhouse to meet him. And I found out why I had not heard from him was he had been saving up to buy me something very special.",
            "But unfortunately, the day he got it out of layaway was the very--",
            "Oh god, I am so relieved. I was afraid I had made that whole thing up in my head and was turning out to be crazy like Mama. Because, see, what happened was I drove up, Buddy [? Grays ?] gives me my change and my chili dog. And I just sit there waiting for something to happen. And finally I say, \"Buddy.\" He says, \"What?\" He says, \"Hi.\" He says, \"Hi.\" And I drove off feeling like I wasn\u0027t even in this world. I am so relieved somebody besides me thinks that happened.",
            "Well, sometimes I get real bored.",
            "Now, wait, Joey. What did I ever do to you?",
            "Yeah?",
            "Yeah?",
            "Oh, Joey, I am just sick I ruined your senior year. But how did I do it exactly?",
            "Oh, Joey, that is so pretty. Bless your heart, it really is.",
            "Look how it sparkles almost like a genuine diamond. If I wore this, people might think it was really real.",
            "[SINGING] This diamond is really real, Joey.",
            "[SINGING] Do you really wanna marry me?",
            "[SINGING] Oh, Joey, how did it come to this? I\u0027m so depressed.",
            "Oh, you could call it a whole lot of things. Like if you\u0027re trying to be--",
            "[SINGING] I\u0027m so flattered, I can\u0027t tell you. But Jesus has another plan for me. And, Joey, it\u0027ll be better for you, too. Some day you\u0027re gonna thank me for all the girls you would have missed and never kissed if I said yes.",
            "Well, that too, yes.",
            "Me and my boyfriend were driving around the loop, and we were having a terrible fight. I remember that he called me a son of a bitch. And that confused me, so I opened the passenger door and flung myself into traffic. First, I was hit by a pink Coupe de Ville, knocked me into the path of an out of state semi and just squished me flat into that burning asphalt.",
            "[SINGING] So it really has to be goodbye?",
            "[SINGING] One more time to remember me by?",
            "[SINGING] One more time so I\u0027ll remember, too.",
            "Joey, do you take me for a fool? I know you do.",
            "But after I had committed suicide, I started seeing things in a whole new light. I noticed what a cute boy my boyfriend was. Couldn\u0027t understand why I\u0027d been calling him a decorated rat only moments before my fatal plunge. I took his hand. It was chaffed and slightly smaller than mine. We went home, and I made him some biscuits and gravy from scratch, because I really wanted to.",
            "It\u0027s good to commit suicide when there\u0027s something you just can\u0027t figure out. Like when I hit high school and I found out you\u0027re a bitch if you don\u0027t and a whore if you do. Commit suicide when you\u0027ve got a burning question that no one can answer for you. Mine was, what are these boys for, and what am I supposed to do with them? Don\u0027t get upset about the war in the Middle East. Do something. Kill yourself.",
            "It\u0027s good to commit suicide over small things that other people might neglect, like grocery shopping. I can\u0027t imagine walking into that ATB without first committing suicide. Think about it. Commit suicide first thing in the morning. And that way, you feel better all day. Do it your first day on a new job, and the next day you can call in dead. Do it early in a love affair and just get it over with.",
            "That\u0027s why me and the boys are going to commit suicide right now. We hope that you will join us. Just start getting really pitiful and morose, and in the third verse, we will slit our wrists."

And I know that because every time I kiss another one, I can feel Jesus right through his skin. And I need to know Jesus fully. Jesus in a brown leather jacket. Or the kind of thuggy Jesus with the hooded eyes like Robert Mitchum. Or the Jesus you want to make biscuits for. Or the Jesus you want to wrestle with. Or the Catholic Jesus. Or the Jesus who\u0027s so good in bed you think he\u0027s Catholic, but really he\u0027s not. There was even a Yankee Jesus."

And when my husband slipped that golden wedding ring on my finger, it was the first time I\u0027d ever strayed off of that spiritual path that Jesus had set out for me so specifically years before."

There\u0027s a long, purple scar up Lorraine\u0027s stomach from where they pulled Dawn out, but Lorraine\u0027s stomach is flat and tight like a boy\u0027s. She must know how to throw up, too.",
            "\"Ta-da,\" Lorraine says. \"You look fox, Lorraine,\" Dawn says. \"Yeah,\" I say. \"No doubt.\"",
            "The optometrist pulls up in a Chrysler, a dark blue car with brown interior. I\u0027m thinking, loser, but Lorraine runs out of the kitchen, shoving her earrings in, smoothing down a red satin dress she bought at Shoes and Things for $20. She\u0027s blushing and pursing her lips to smooth her lip stick down and breathing fast as she let\u0027s the optometrist inside.",
            "He looks bewildered, unprepared to be stepping into a woman\u0027s house.",
            "\"Dawn,\" Lorraine says in her giggle voice that is saved for men only, \"I\u0027ll be home late, or not at all.\" Dawn rolls her eyes. \"Watch it now, young lady,\" \"OK,\" Dawn mumbles. \"I\u0027ll feed the fish.\"",
            "\"OK, Lorraine,\" the optometrist says nervously.\" \"Seafood OK?\" Lorraine just giggles and takes his arm. They head out to the car and drive away, and I want to cry, thinking of that skanking old guy with his hands all over Lorraine\u0027s perfect, tight body. But then I remember Dawn and me are on our own now.",
            "We sit down at the kitchen table and light cigarettes and drink half a glass each of Lorraine\u0027s pink Zinfandel wine, because more than that she notices. \"Man,\" Dawn says, \"I can\u0027t wait to get a place of my own. All I\u0027m going to have in the fridge in pink Zinfandel and powdered doughnuts and 7-Up. Dawn loves powdered doughnuts because they\u0027re the easiest thing in the world to throw up.",
            "Tonight we\u0027re off to the mall to hunt for babes. Dawn says if she falls in love at the mall, she\u0027ll go out to the pit. \"And leave me hanging by the fountain,\" I scream. \"No,\" she says, plugging in her crimping iron. \"There\u0027ll be a babe for you, too. We\u0027ll find two babes and fall in love and make them take us to the pit.\"",
            "Dawn\u0027s going to be a stewardess when she graduates high school, or work at the U-Haul with Lorraine. I\u0027m going to Wilfred Beauty Academy to learn acrylic nails. When I get out of Wilfred, no one will call me a fat cow. They\u0027ll call me a nail stylist.",
            "I have a new makeup stick in dark coral pink. I put it on above my eyes like I saw in Beauty Digest. Dawn puts it on her cheeks and outlines her lips in burnt sienna. She rubs a stick of musk behind her ears and under her arms, filling the room with the smell of a jungle.",
            "We lie flat on the bed next to each other to zip our jeans. When I stand up, there\u0027s a role of fat over the waistband, so I borrow a loose sweater from Dawn, something with draw strings at the bottom. Dawn is straight and thin and wears padded bras that make tiny puff breasts under her shirts. I wish I could throw up like her.",
            "We each swallow four of Lorraine\u0027s Dexatrims and two of her No-Dozs and then fluff our hair out so we look like wild animals. We only take one each of Lorraine\u0027s Valiums, because those she counts.",
            "The cab lets us off at Sears. We go in through the luggage department and straight into the bathroom. Dawn doesn\u0027t like the way her hair turned out, so she wets it in the sink and kneels under the hand dryer, on knee on the tile floor to do it over. I look at myself in the mirror. My hair and nails are perfect. I know how to copy the looks. But my cheeks are full and red, not hollow and sharp like Dawn\u0027s. Tomorrow I\u0027ll eat nothing but tuna fish and water.",
            "We walk out to the benches around the fountain and spot Carol and Gail. Even from two stores down, I can see Carol\u0027s lost weight, and I\u0027m instantly jealous. She was always a pudge like me. Then she had to go to the clinic for an abortion, and she threw up for two days after the anesthetic. It makes me wonder why no one sells anesthetic to fat people for a diet. I guess it\u0027s against the law, but still it isn\u0027t fair.",
            "Two weeks before Carol went to the clinic, she said, \"Janine, walk with me to the deli.\" So I walked with her to the deli and got a ham sandwich with only a little mayo and even pulled the crusts off and threw them away. Carol got change for the phone. She called the clinic and said she got raped and wanted the morning after pill. This wasn\u0027t true.",
            "Carol told me about the moment down in the pit when Scott Malone had finally got off her, and she had to squat and search for a full minute before she found the rubber. It didn\u0027t matter, anyway, because the clinic said she had to tell the police first if she got raped. So Carol hung up and fell against gallon jars of pickled cauliflower, crying her eyes out. But when I tried to put my arm around her, she said, \"You smell like ham, Janine,\" and pushed me away. I don\u0027t care. Dawn is my best friend, anyway.",
            "Dawn and me and Carol and Gail are sitting in front of the fountain waiting for babes. Gail is beautiful and goes out with Joey Cosmo, who has a roll bar in his truck and wild blond hair like a rock star. But he\u0027s at some truck show in Garden City tonight, so Gail is a free agent.",
            "I never told anyone, but I have a secret about Joey Cosmo. Once I walked by Sheer Impact, and I saw Joey sitting under a dryer with perm rods in his hair. It made we want him even more, seeing him with the plastic sheet over him, the white towel around his neck, and blue and yellow perm rods covering his head like a helmet. Any guy who thinks he ought to try and look good, even if he\u0027s a babe already, has got to be sort of sweet. I wouldn\u0027t cheat on him just because he went to a truck show without me, but I\u0027m not beautiful like Gail, and the rules are different.",
            "Tonight Gail has done her eyes in blue liner. Her hair is soft blond that curls at her shoulder, and she\u0027s long and thin in pink cords and a black sweater that shows a beige bra under her arm when she lifts a hand to flip her hair back. It\u0027s hard to believe we\u0027re both girls. I\u0027ve never come close to looking anything like her.",
            "\"What\u0027s up?\" She says, throwing her cigarette into the fountain. There\u0027s a hiss as flame hits water. \"Nothing,\" Dawn says. \"How you feeling?\" I ask Carol. She gives me a look. \"I\u0027m staying at Gail\u0027s.\" \"Janine\u0027s staying at my house,\" Dawn says. \"How come?\" Gail asks, suddenly interested, thinking something\u0027s up like I\u0027m pregnant or something. \"My stepfather\u0027s a skank,\" I say quickly, feeling a moment\u0027s pride being the center of attention. \"They\u0027re all skanks,\" Gail says. \"My stepfather stole 10 bucks from my purse last week.\" Dawn\u0027s elbow sinks into my side. \"Babes,\" she whispers. And there they are.",
            "Three guys turning the corner from Monkey Ward\u0027s. We lean back with our toes stretched out in high heels. I can feel the water spray against my back, but I don\u0027t move. The waist of my jeans is like an iron band. I can hardly breathe.",
            "Dawn stands. \"Janine, let\u0027s go.\" \"We just sat down,\" I say. \"Look at that babe in the red leather,\" Dawn says. \"He\u0027s checking me out.\" \"Can\u0027t we just sit here a while?\" I say. \"Janine, do you want to be a fat cow all your life?\" Dawn says. \"The blond one isn\u0027t bad. He\u0027s got long hair. Let\u0027s go.\"",
            "We go after the babes. They strut around the corner of Camera Hut with long, pink combs sticking out of their back pockets. Dawn\u0027s right. I have to do something with my life.",
            "We follow them down the north corridor of the mall. I watch the babe in the red leather. His thin hips jut back and forth in tight black denims. I feel myself slow and heavy at Dawn\u0027s side.",
            "They go into Orange Julius, and Dawn clicks fast on high heels behind them. The two bomber jackets buy chili dogs, but the red leather buys fries. He turns as he squirts ketchup, and he has these unbelievable sea-green eyes. I feel a butterfly come alive in my stomach, and I could almost collapse with the feel of it coming over me. But I force myself to look at the blond one, like Dawn wants, even though he\u0027s ugly.",
            "\"What\u0027s up?\" The babe asks, staring down at the floor. He smiles, and I see his teeth are white and clean like a commercial. He has dyed black hair with brown roots. \"Nothing,\" Dawn says, moving in. I try and give the blond one a look, but he\u0027s worse close up. His hair is long but hangs flat against the sides of his face, and his body is round and square like Barney Rubble. I feel myself rolling loose, bursting against my jeans, and I can see from his face that I\u0027m just as unappealing to him. I manage a weak smile.",
            "They slide into a booth with their food, throwing fries at each other across the table. We order cheese fries and sit across from them. We suck cheese off the fries and then put them back on the plate, waiting. I suck only five fries. Dawn sucks down practically the whole plate. She can. She\u0027s already thrown up twice since breakfast.",
            "Dawn and me eat scrambled eggs with tall glasses of tomato juice for dinner because we\u0027re on a diet. Dawn knows how to throw up, so she eats toast and butter, too. But my fingers go so far down my throat, and still nothing comes up. I\u0027m a fat cow.",
            "Finally the babe finishes his food and looks across the table at Dawn. \"Hey,\" the babe says. \"Hey,\" Dawn says. \"What\u0027s up?\" he says. \"Nothing,\" she says. \"You want to hang out?\" \"Sure,\" she says. \"I\u0027m Dawn. This is Janine.\" \"Hey,\" he says, looking my way for the briefest moment. He\u0027s a definite babe. Tall and thin with hollow cheeks and a square chin. \"Listen,\" Dawn says, leaning in towards the babe. She gives a look-- perfect, all eyes and lips. \"Janine was checking out your friend,\" she whispers. \"The blond guy. She\u0027s in love with him or something.\" \"That\u0027s Stevie,\" the babe says. \"He\u0027s cool.\"",
            "The babe stands, pressing his hips into the edge of the table. Dawn\u0027s fingers stroke the tabletop. Her nails, hard pink shells, click against the tabletop. \"Cool,\" she whispers. She stands, brushing against the babe as she pulls out of the booth. There\u0027s the sizzle of fabric against fabric. \"We\u0027ll meet you by Macy\u0027s,\" she says, and struts fast out of Orange Julius, heading back towards the Sears bathroom. I follow, running to keep up.",
            "In the bathroom I open my eyes as wide as possible, feeling tears building up at the edge of my mascara. \"I can\u0027t believe you, Dawn.\" My voice is heavy and scratched. \"Telling that guy I was hot for his skank friend.\" \"He\u0027s all right,\" Dawn says, putting on lip gloss with a fingertip. \"He has long hair. What\u0027s with you?\" \"I don\u0027t want to hang with him is all.\" I press my index fingers to the corner of my eyes. The tips of my fingers are black with mascara and tears. There\u0027s a noise at the back of my throat that wants to come out, but I know Dawn will be mad if I let it.",
            "My stomach feels huge. The thought of that skanky Barney Rubble out there makes me want to puke, though he\u0027s no worse than some of the others I\u0027ve had to put up with. It\u0027s no coincidence that every babe Dawn finds has a skanky-looking best friend along with him. That\u0027s what people see when they look at Dawn and me. I\u0027ve noticed how beautiful people like to have a skank friend to hang out with. It makes them look even better.",
            "\"Oh, man,\" Dawn says. \"Are you my best friend, or what?\" \"You know I am.\" My voice cracks in half. Carefully I wipe away the black tear running down my cheek with a twist of Kleenex. \"I just don\u0027t want to be with that guy,\" I tell her. \"He\u0027s a skank, and you know it.\"",
            "A lady comes into the bathroom carrying a shopping bag. She goes into a stall. Dawn turns the hand dryer on so we can talk privately. \"Look,\" Dawn whispers. \"If you\u0027re my best friend, you\u0027ll do this for me. Because I\u0027ll tell you one thing for sure-- only my best friend can sleep over at my house tonight.\" I stand there weeping. It takes forever to get my breath.",
            "\"Janine,\" Dawn says finally, tiring of my crap, \"fix your face and let\u0027s go.\" I get out my compact and brush powder across my cheekbones, and then redo my mascara and eyeliner. I work quickly, knowing Dawn will leave me behind if I don\u0027t hurry.",
            "A woman comes in with a little boy, chocolate ice cream smeared down his cheeks. She lifts him up to the sink and wets a tissue to wipe his face. I want to go away with her. I want to be a child again.",
            "\"Look,\" Dawn says, leaning into me, her voice softer now. \"You don\u0027t have to do anything. I just don\u0027t want to be alone with the guy the first time. We\u0027ll stick together, I promise. And later when we get home, we\u0027ll eat some eggs or something. OK?\"",
            "I nod my head. My face is glowing again in the mirror. I open my eyes wide, testing my mascara. A toilet flushes, and the woman with the shopping bag comes out, washes up, looks at herself in the mirror. She slides her lips together, evening out her lipstick. She\u0027s pretty for an old lady. She must be at least 40. It\u0027s depressing to think about all the years I\u0027ll have to worry about my makeup and my hair before I get old enough that no one cares.",
            "Dawn and me are best friends. I sleep over at her house now ever since my stepfather called me a pig for eating all his cocktail onions. I\u0027m waiting for my mom to call and beg me to come back home, but it\u0027s been almost two weeks now. I\u0027m wondering if maybe their phone is broken.",
            "We leave the bathroom, head to Macy\u0027s, and there they are, waiting for us by the exit. The babe sees us and pulls a wig crooked on a mannequin to show off. I smile. My skin is tight with layers of powder, but underneath it I can feel my face swollen from crying.",
            "\"Hey, what\u0027s up?\" The babe says. \"This is my buddy. Stevie. He\u0027s cool.\" \"Hi,\" I say. I bend my lips up into something like a smile. Dawn is giggling with her hand over her mouth. \"What\u0027s up?\" Stevie says. His eyes are crooked and small.",
            "We head out to the parking lot. It\u0027s dark out. Headlights reflect off cars as we walk out to the strip of grass that separates the highway from Macy\u0027s parking lot. Thick, green bushes are planted in a row that lead out to the entrance and exit signs that separate the lanes of traffic in and out of Macy\u0027s.",
            "Dawn and me lean against the enter sign. Stevie and the babe stand across from us. The babe has a pint of Southern Comfort. He passes it around. A wind is blowing, drying the sweat under my arms.",
            "\"So,\" the babe says, finally, \"what\u0027s up?\" \"I\u0027m cold,\" Dawn says. \"Here,\" he says. He takes off his leather, wraps it around her, leaving his arm on her shoulder.",
            "Suddenly they\u0027re going at it. She falls against the enter sign with a bang, and I move away quickly as he presses into her with his hips and chest. I look at Stevie and past him at the cars streaming by on the highway. He makes a noise in his throat and spits on the grass.",
            "\"What\u0027s up?\" he says. \"Nothing,\" I say, looking down. He put his arm around me. The babe has a hand up Dawn\u0027s shirt. I catch a corner of her bra under his cupped hand. Stevie\u0027s hand curls around my shoulder slowly. I can tell he thinks I won\u0027t notice.",
            "The babe breaks away from Dawn a moment and says, \"time to hit the pit?\" Dawn looks at me. \"Come on, Janine.\" I shake my head. She puckers her lips. We go behind the exit sign. She\u0027s sweaty, her makeup rising like a film over her face. \"Janine you want a place to sleep tonight?\" Her voice is thick, breathless. It\u0027s dark enough out that I just let my mascara run with a flood of tears. I know Dawn can see, but she just flips her hair and steps back away from me, talking loud so the guys can hear.",
            "\"You think you can do better?\" she says. I look at her. Even in the wind from the cars and the sweat on her face, she\u0027s still something I\u0027ll never be. From the tiny points of her shoulders to the long swoop of her legs, down to her ankles, like glass balanced on high heels. I give in.",
            "We cross the highway and take the path down to the woods we call the pit. It\u0027s just dug up land from where they took the dirt to make the cement for the mall a million years ago. Thin pine trees planted along the highway have grown tall to block out the streetlights, and below, sticker bushes divide the pit into narrow pathways and openings where people hang in the dark to fool around or do drugs or hide from the cops.",
            "Sometimes my mom spaces on time. She drinks a lot of green Hi-C with vodka in it. I\u0027ve seen her sit down with a drink in the morning just as Oprah is coming on, and then it\u0027s like next thing she knows, Hard Copy is coming on and my stepdad is walking in the door, screaming because he can\u0027t smell any dinner.",
            "Stevie has a hand on my ass. He whispers in my ear, \"You got at nice body, OK?\" The babe and Dawn have disappeared into the woods. I call her name, but she won\u0027t answer. From up the hill I hear a truck shifting gears, a horn. Some guy screams, \"Dildo.\" Stevie says, \"Shh, relax.\"",
            "We walk further into the pit, passing the dark outlines of couples against trees or rolling slowly in the dirt. We find a clearing with an overturned shopping cart, and Stevie sits. I go to sit next to him, but he grabs my head tight over my ears so that everything sounds like an ocean. And behind the roar I hear him whispering, \"I love you. Yeah, I really love you, OK?\" Pushing me down to my knees, pushing my face into his zipper. And then there\u0027s the smell of him, gagging me through his jeans.",
            "I\u0027ve been in this position before, lots of times, because of Dawn and other girls who were once my best friend. And lots of times when I thought maybe a guy might really like me. I know I\u0027m supposed to go numb, just open my mouth and let it happen, and then wait for Dawn to call me to go home.",
            "But this time I can\u0027t seem to. This time there\u0027s no pretending that I\u0027m doing it for Dawn or for myself or for any reason at all. Because this time I can see suddenly that Dawn is getting tired of me. Even if I play this right with Stevie, my days are numbered as her best friend.",
            "I open my eyes. After a moment, the gold thread along the zipper of his jeans appears. Tears are running into my mouth. My M up is shot. I try. I try so hard for Dawn, for my best friend. I try to keep my face pressed against his zipper, but I can\u0027t. And when his hand comes down and unbuttons his jeans, I pull away and stand up.",
            "\"You\u0027re a skank,\" I hear myself say. \"Hey,\" he says. \"Come on, help me out here. You can\u0027t leave me like this. It\u0027s killing me, OK?\"",
            "I call for Dawn, but she still won\u0027t answer, so I turn and start back up toward the road. \"Hey,\" Stevie yells after me. \"You on the rag or something?\" \"I\u0027m leaving, Dawn,\" I yell one last time. I know if I walk back to the mall, I\u0027ll be doing something awful. I know as soon as I step out of these woods, I won\u0027t have a best friend anymore.",
            "\"Oh, get lost, fat girl,\" Stevie yells from behind me. Then after a moment he adds, \"It\u0027s your loss, OK?\" I start to run. I run up out of the woods and across the highway and through the lines of parked cars and into Macy\u0027s. I run through lingerie and pantyhose and piles of scarves. I run to the center of the mall where I stop, with a burning cramp squeezing my side, feeling my fat stomach covered in sweat under Dawn\u0027s borrowed sweater. I stand there panting, my face aching with dried tears. No one seems to notice me.",
            "The benches by the fountain are empty, and something tells me if I\u0027ve lost Dawn, I\u0027ve lost Gail and Carol, too. I\u0027ve lost all the girls that sit at Dawn\u0027s lunch table at school. I\u0027m all alone, and I have nowhere to sleep tonight.",
            "I go into Anthony\u0027s and buy three slices with pepperoni with the last of my money. I eat as fast as I can, with warm grease dripping down my neck. My throat burns with swallowing so fast.",
            "But I\u0027m over at Dawn\u0027s house now. We share a single bed with the quilted pink covers. We stay up late smoking cigarettes, talking about love with the ashtray balanced between us on the sheets. Dawn loves guys who give long, wet kisses that make her eyes roll up in her head. I love bites that last like red splashes on my neck for weeks, so that everyone knows I\u0027ve been going at it. Dawn and me both agree, though-- mostly, we just want to fall in love. Tonight we\u0027re going to the mall to fall in love.",
            "Inside the Sears bathroom there are two girls at the sink. I don\u0027t know them. One girl has her head back, and the other is French braiding her hair. Best friends. When they see me, one of them reaches up, turns on the hand dryer to shut me out.",
            "I go into a stall and lean over the bowl, one hand holding onto the toilet paper roll. The other hand turns into a knife. I stick it down into my throat until my stomach starts to shake and my mouth gags open, and the pizza rushes back up me and down, splashing into the bowl.",
            "The hand dryer clicks off. One of the girls says, \"Lisa should never wear yellow. Have you noticed that? She looks like a frog in yellow. It\u0027s weird.\"",
            "I lean against the wall of the stall, my head against the coat hook. My stomach feels thin and flat, empty. I let out a deep breath of air, and just for that one moment, between letting air out and filling myself up again, I feel beautiful, like a puzzle piece sliding in to fit. But then it\u0027s gone, and I flush the toilet and come out.",
            "Dawn\u0027s mom is divorced, and Dawn gets to call her Lorraine instead of Mom. We smoke Lorraine\u0027s Marlboro Lights at the kitchen table with a green ashtray. Lorraine is in the shower with her loofah pad and her pineapple-smelling shampoo, getting ready to go out with an optometrist she met at work.",
            "Lorraine works behind the counter at the U-Haul center on Motor Parkway, and she gets to wear this tight, orange dress that says U-Haul on it. She meets a lot of men because of that dress, not to mention that any guy who gets divorced ends up at U-Haul sooner or later with a sad look on his face."
