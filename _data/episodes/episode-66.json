Well, a few weeks ago, we invited you to send us your stories of life on the internet, to send unusual or amusing email exchanges, interesting things you\u0027ve found in Usenet groups or on web pages. Hundreds of people responded. I recorded interviews with some of them and invited the ones who live here in Chicago to Chicago\u0027s Museum of Contemporary Art for a show. Today on our program, what happened when all the tapes and readings and people were gathered onstage in the museum\u0027s theater."

      "text": "Guy one: \"I was just talking with someone. And we started thinking about a couple of girls we know that used to give us piggyback rides. Here\u0027s an interesting thought. One girl was, like, 5\u00272\", weighed 110 pounds. She wasn\u0027t a great athlete and didn\u0027t have a lot of muscle, and she was able to give me piggyback rides with ease, while I weigh close to 200 pounds. So with that thought in mind, I\u0027m curious to know, assuming you believe that piggyback rides are the easiest way to lift a person, which they are, how much weight would you guess some fitness and body building women could lift piggyback? I mean, if they can lift 200-pound guys over their shoulders and press them overhead, just imagine how much they could lift piggyback. Any thoughts?\""

    {
      "speakerName": "Steve Sedin",
      "text": "So the response to that is, \"Yeah, here\u0027s a thought. Where are the lift-a-200-pound-man-overhead-and-press-him women? Boy, would I ever like to see that. I mean, who cares about piggyback rides? A piggyback ride isn\u0027t a lift at all. The man just climbs on. And all the weight is supported by the bones of the legs, because the legs are already locked out. Not impressive, not sexy. But to see a woman militarily press a man, now, that\u0027s worth paying to see. My greatest thrill would be to see a tall, muscular woman pick up a tiny man under his armpits and dangle him in midair. Impossible, you say? Maybe. But consider this. In 1988, the women\u0027s weightlifting championships were dominated by young, teenage girls. I saw a 16-year-old Chinese girl snatch 165 pounds as though it were a feather. She cleaned and jerked 231 pounds without so much as making a face. She weighed 132 pounds. Try this, guys. Go to your garage and load up that old barbell with, say, 270 pounds. Try to dead-lift it. See how heavy it feels. Now, picture a cute, 17-year-old 99-pound pound Chinese girl take that same barbell and lift it all the way overhead in about five seconds.\" So the response to that is, \"Yes, I agree. Now we\u0027re getting close to the real thing.\" Thank you."

It reads one more digit of precision, so we now have a weight of 3.9 ounces. I have done the math to compute the density of the ball. Curiously, it is much lower than that of solid aluminum. I have a hard time believing that the ball is less than half aluminum by mass, so I invite you to let me know if there are any errors in my computations. I expected that the density would be less than that of solid aluminum because of a small amount of air between layers of the foil, the adhesive coatings, inks, and small quantities of chocolate, grease, and other leftovers from the food items that the wrappers were originally used to package. I wouldn\u0027t have been too surprised by 5 or even 10% difference. But I find the actual results obtained a little difficult to believe.\""

        "I came across a Usenet group called alt.amazonwomen.admirers. And this is a short dialogue between two guys.",
        "Guy one: \"I was just talking with someone. And we started thinking about a couple of girls we know that used to give us piggyback rides. Here\u0027s an interesting thought. One girl was, like, 5\u00272\", weighed 110 pounds. She wasn\u0027t a great athlete and didn\u0027t have a lot of muscle, and she was able to give me piggyback rides with ease, while I weigh close to 200 pounds. So with that thought in mind, I\u0027m curious to know, assuming you believe that piggyback rides are the easiest way to lift a person, which they are, how much weight would you guess some fitness and body building women could lift piggyback? I mean, if they can lift 200-pound guys over their shoulders and press them overhead, just imagine how much they could lift piggyback. Any thoughts?\"",
        "So the response to that is, \"Yeah, here\u0027s a thought. Where are the lift-a-200-pound-man-overhead-and-press-him women? Boy, would I ever like to see that. I mean, who cares about piggyback rides? A piggyback ride isn\u0027t a lift at all. The man just climbs on. And all the weight is supported by the bones of the legs, because the legs are already locked out. Not impressive, not sexy. But to see a woman militarily press a man, now, that\u0027s worth paying to see. My greatest thrill would be to see a tall, muscular woman pick up a tiny man under his armpits and dangle him in midair. Impossible, you say? Maybe. But consider this. In 1988, the women\u0027s weightlifting championships were dominated by young, teenage girls. I saw a 16-year-old Chinese girl snatch 165 pounds as though it were a feather. She cleaned and jerked 231 pounds without so much as making a face. She weighed 132 pounds. Try this, guys. Go to your garage and load up that old barbell with, say, 270 pounds. Try to dead-lift it. See how heavy it feels. Now, picture a cute, 17-year-old 99-pound pound Chinese girl take that same barbell and lift it all the way overhead in about five seconds.\" So the response to that is, \"Yes, I agree. Now we\u0027re getting close to the real thing.\" Thank you.",

        "OK, this is a romance story. I met this guy last fall. And he worked most of the week in another part of the country. He would fly out on Sunday night and come back on Thursday night. So our romance was conducted through the net. And because he was away so much, we talked or emailed back and forth every day.",
        "And I don\u0027t know if other people have had this experience, but if you start going out with someone and you\u0027re writing them over the net, it\u0027s very exciting. You come home, and you turn on the computer, and it\u0027s one of the first things that you think about. And it really adds this element that, I don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve never had before.",
        "So anyway, we went out for about three or four months. And we fell in love. But eventually, we started to have problems. Our daily correspondence became more and more strained. And finally, I wrote him this email that I\u0027m going to read to you.",
        "\"Dear Sam, I feel like I\u0027m making you feel worse, and I can\u0027t bear that. I am so sorry. I think that you should have peace. And I pray for you. I pray for that for you every day. I think you should take some time and call me when you do feel more peace.\"",
        "So this was very heartfelt. And I did think that he would write me back. And after about two and a half weeks, he hadn\u0027t written me. And this was a dramatic departure for us.",
        "And so when we finally did talk, it was like Vietnam. There was about 36 hours of a intense meltdown. And I fired out five hysterical emails, which I won\u0027t read to you. And we broke up. And while we were breaking up, my computer crashed. And I lost all of my email. And so I lost all of this correspondence from him, which was 100 pages, easily. And I wrote him. And I told them about this. And he sent me two caches of folders, his mail and my mail.",
        "Well, at that time, I didn\u0027t want to read through all of this. It was a little too painful. I just wanted it. I wanted to have it. So when I prepared for this show tonight, I decided to go back and read through it. And I discovered something, which was that he did email me back. I just never got it. And part of the hell-- I was in hell for those two or three weeks before we talked.",
        "So this is what he emailed me that I discovered. It said, \"Dolores, you are so good a person. I\u0027m very proud to know you and have you in my life. I will take some time and get grounded, and then call you. Thanks for all your love and understanding.\" Well, I was flabbergasted. It took me several days to even wrap my mind around the fact that he had sent this. And it completely altered my experience of that time and of him. And I still can\u0027t quite assimilate it, really.",
        "Now, this is the question that every man I tell this story to asks me. It didn\u0027t occur to me. And he would have had to have gone through quite a bit of trouble to do it, because it is encoded with all of the information. I don\u0027t know. What do you think?",

        "My name is Noel, and I\u0027m diastematic. Anybody here know what that means? It means that I have a gap between my front two teeth. For those of you unfamiliar with this whole website gap-tooth thing, I built a website for gap-tooth people. So, yeah, idiotic. You want it, you\u0027ve got it. But I\u0027m in good company. 10% of America, including David Letterman, Lauren Hutton, Noam Chomsky, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, Itzhak Perlman, Chaucer\u0027s Wife of Bath, Vince Lombardi, blah, blah, blah, all with two cleavage. I must admit, for better or for worse, yes, I\u0027m the one who built this website. But the emphasis is humor.",
        "In early November last year--",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This will hit on a lot of those themes. In the early November last year, I was watching a Bears-Packers game. And during the pregame ceremonies, the USPS, the post office, unveiled art for a new stamp, due this summer, featuring the late great Vince Lombardi, who was one of the greatest gappers ever to live. He was on a stamp, riding high atop the team in the throes of victory, smiling huge. But something was missing, Coach Lombardi\u0027s trademark gap-toothed grin. He had near-perfect pearly whites, and the gap was gone.",
        "The next day, as a joke, I added a page to the gap-tooth website, protesting the post office\u0027s depiction of Lombardi as a cosmetically-altered hero. Who would Don King be if he were bald? Or Gorbachev without the Kool-Aid stain? Or Jimmy Durante without that nose?",
        "So knowing that this was one small effort to have a little fun while making a point, knowing that this was the Web, the oddball media that gets no real merit for its content, I expected little to no attention. But then came Yahoo, which featured it as a weekly pick. The Washington Post had me on the phone and ran a half-page story with my before and after pics. Chicago\u0027s Channel 7 came to my apartment and ran a story on its 6 o\u0027clock news just for the Super Bowl.",
        "Getting out of hand? Yeah, timeout. If you\u0027re thinking this pathetic web-based protest should never have received any attention, I\u0027m in agreement with you. What was ironic about this story is that they painted me as a freak-- imagine that-- a superfan, ready to strap myself with bombs and blow up my teeth and Washington, D.C., if they didn\u0027t change the art. And it was all pretty much lighthearted.",
        "So Bob, the artist of the postage stamp, latched back to the AP. And I thought, this is just fun. I mean, I\u0027m just running a website for gap-toothed people. You can\u0027t take me that seriously. So I called up Bob, and we talked about the stamp. We discussed angles and art representation. He was a really nice guy. I was thinking about dropping the protest already when he told me his three-year-old daughter was gap-toothed.",
        "And that was it. Protest over. But what still gets me today is that the Web has the power to make insignificant things seem real, that email can really serve as a powerful form of protest, which it did in this case, and that people, including myself, really do have too much time on their hands."

        "Do I just start?",
        "OK. A former friend of mine from high school is currently living with her husband and son in England. And every three weeks or so, she sends out what I call a broadcast email. And she sends it to what has now become 56 email addresses. I\u0027m going to read one of the broadcast emails. But before I do, I think I should make two notes. One is that she refers to her husband as \"Bobo\" or \"Bo.\" And she refers to her son as \"Boo\" because she named him after Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird.",
        "Granted, that is his nickname. So she also rates her adventures with \"paws,\" like bear paws. And for example, once, after visiting the Stratford on Avon, she said, \"Three paws for Shakespeareville.\" So here\u0027s the first one that I ever received.",
        "\"Hi. Baby Boo had his first day in London this weekend. We went to the British Museum, a quick stop to Harod\u0027s, and really quick stops to Big Ben and Westminster Abbey to take pictures. We bought a six-foot diameter beach towel that I lay out for Boo to play on. I told him that it\u0027s his boundary, and if he crawls off it, he\u0027ll get electrocuted from the wires. You know, like those dog training things. Well, he does a good job of keeping me on my feet now. Before, I had to watch him every second. Now, I have to watch him every millisecond.\"",
        "Exactly. But this comes-- I think I\u0027ve received these over the last year. And these come fairly regularly, like once a month.",
        "Well, actually, what\u0027s really interesting is that she and I have grown apart. And I didn\u0027t really quite know how to end the relationship. But these emails have actually given me some closure, because--",
        "I don\u0027t say anything. It used to-- [DING]",
        "Oh, ok. And I never have to say anything. I never respond to them. But she continues to send them to me, and I have a lot of fun reading them. And before, I used to feel really guilty. Like I wouldn\u0027t respond to her letters or I wouldn\u0027t be a good friend. But now, I feel like, OK, well, we\u0027re just so different.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Right. And then I just read it. And actually-- I\u0027m really horrible, and I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m going to admit this-- but I actually send it out to two of my other friends, who also-- [LAUGHTER] I forward it to two other friends, who are sitting out there. And they read it and comment back to me. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this.",
        "My friends and I sat and thought about it. And we thought, well, I don\u0027t think she listens to NPR."

      "statements": [
        "I was on AOL and other services in San Francisco a lot. And there are these chat rooms where gay men can meet and talk. And in San Francisco, it\u0027s fairly wild. There\u0027s a 24-hour bulletin board that I was observing for this study was doing, where you could almost be guaranteed that, if you lived in San Francisco and you had a modem, you could have sex any time of the day or night. This was a very goal-directed bulletin board.",
        "Right. And you would know exactly what they wanted to do. And you\u0027d probably have nude pictures of them before that. What I also thought was really interesting-- and this was more true of AOL-- that there was a new metaphysics of sexuality, because people would talk about cybersex or real sex. And it occurred to me, after I listened to enough, by real sex, they meant phone sex.",
        "Yeah, so it became, instead of a two-tier system, it\u0027s a three-tier system. And you have real sex, ultra-real sex, and cybersex.",
        "That would mean what I call a slow-time interface, which means actual physical contact.",
        "Yes.",
        "I know people that actually leave physical dates to go home and have sex over the net with the quick cam.",
        "It\u0027s true. There\u0027s an entire culture that\u0027s entirely video transmission sexuality now.",
        "Yeah, me, in fact. Yes.",
        "Yeah, they left me. But he said that that is what he does lately. And I understood that, because a lot of men are afraid of sexual contact because of AIDS. So the perfect thing to eroticize is distance.",
        "Pretty soon. He said that he really needed to do the CU-SeeMe stuff.",
        "We would have a fantasy about, what if he came to my classroom and then I took him back into my office? But it was really sort of a game. But these narratives became so intense that we would set times of the day, or he would just check in. And he said, \"Do you have time for a story now?\" And he would start it. And then I\u0027d continue it. And we have all of these stories.",
        "But as we kept doing this, then a little part of his life would come in. And then there would be a story that we take us somewhere else. And then I\u0027d know a little bit more. And soon, the sex part was really an excuse to tell the other stories. And sometimes, he would be telling this story about his childhood in Missouri. And then it would remind him of a social fantasy. And then he\u0027d put me in it. And you couldn\u0027t plan to do these things. We became sort of like jazz pianists or something. We\u0027d have these riffs together.",
        "Then one day, he was asking me if I had time to talk to him. And I was just leaving. But I could tell that even the way he was typing was different.",
        "Yes. Yes.",
        "People have different habits in their speed or the way he would respond or if he didn\u0027t put a smiley face after a certain number words. I just knew there was something really wrong with the way he asked me if I had time. And he said, \"Bad news, son.\" And I think I knew instantly what that was. He had tested positive. And he didn\u0027t know how to break it to me. And our messages to each other then became a lot more about that and about what happened to him as a child and other things that were fairly tragic and amazing that he was telling anybody, because he was really one of the strong, silent types.",
        "Then-- this is when I should have gotten more nervous-- he started saying that he didn\u0027t want any of his porn tapes anymore, because he associated porn with him being positive. So he wanted to mail them to me. And he mailed me a box of them. I didn\u0027t really want them, but he wanted to do this for me. So there was suddenly a box of porn tapes in my house. And then the following week, there was one, too.",
        "And just before I got back to San Francisco, I got a message from him, hoping that I was well and hoping I got the tapes. And he said that I\u0027d get another message very soon. Now, he was writing to me almost entirely in capital letters, which scared me. And I didn\u0027t know why. But here\u0027s the last one. \"I have it all boxed up now. I will give it to my friend. He will mail it for me like he did before. And it will arrive either Thursday or Friday via two-day express. I have a letter coming to you to help explain a few things. Thank you for being a friend when I really needed it. Kenneth.\"",
        "And then, three days, nothing. And then there\u0027s just one line. \"A package should arrive today, 1/19/95. Email me. Cruiser3. Bye. Love, Ken. And then on the 25th, there was one that looked like it was from Ken. It was his screen name. But then, when I opened it up, it said, \"This is a hard note for me to write. Ken left a note to ask me to let you know. Ken took his own life on Friday, January 20. He was cremated yesterday, and his ashes will be dropped into the ocean off San Francisco today. Ken\u0027s mental attitude over the last four to six weeks is very hard to describe. He was a basket case, to say the least. I will keep his account open for the next day if you have any questions or response, and I will try to answer them for you. Ken\u0027s friend, Dave.\"",
        "Yeah. It was the only time I ever saw his handwriting. And that said similar things to this. it was just, \"Thank you for being a friend when I needed it. And I will always love you.\"",
        "It was. And what was really odd was that, when he first sent the first box of tapes, he told me which tape had a scene where the two people are the ones that he imagined us to be. Now, that doesn\u0027t mean that he looked like either one of them. But he knew the fantasy scenario that would resonate with us. So even at that point, our fantasies were constantly mediated by some other technology. And-- which is probably hard for you to imagine-- but none of this cold. There was something so tender about this that I was very moved by this experience.",
        "Yes, I did. Yes.",
        "Yeah, although it\u0027s real. When people say, oh, the computers are making us all isolated and it\u0027s such a cold world, I\u0027ve had emotional experiences and long-term friendships that would have never been possible otherwise.",
        "But he would be such a creep that-- I thought of that, actually, because it seemed almost like a melodrama from a long time ago. It was really tawdry. And if I wrote a short story, I wouldn\u0027t end it this way, because it was too hokey.",
        "Yes. Yeah, he really felt gone. He really felt gone. When I saw somebody else using his screen name, to get a stranger with his screen name, that was really, really chilling."

But none of our friends knew each other, so he couldn\u0027t meet me. And what he ended up doing was obsessing about my photo and deciding, well, I can\u0027t just obsess about her photo. I\u0027d like to know more about her as a person.",
        "So he sent out this broadcast message to everybody in the dorm I lived in that was on the net at the time, asking what I was like. So all these strangers responded. And they just made stuff up. But it was very positive, because what happened was, he ended up writing me a letter on paper, using quotes about all the things that people had said about me, that I was cheerful and intelligent and had a good disposition. He decided I was a rare commodity. I should call him. And I was kind of cornered into calling him by my friends. But this is a story that went nowhere, because he was truly not someone I wanted to end up going out with.",
        "Yeah, I have to admit that-- the first thing he said when I called him up-- because he was really nervous, and I really didn\u0027t care-- he said, \"OK, we can get together. But not Friday night, because Friday night\u0027s the ping-pong tournament.\""

And he said, \"I enjoyed this letter, but I don\u0027t think you meant it for me.\" So then, I wrote back and said thanks, and explained how I\u0027d make the mistake. And he wrote back. And we\u0027ve been writing now for, it\u0027ll be two years this month.",
        "It seems like we had nothing in common going in-- the age difference, and they had no children. And they\u0027re Mormons, and we\u0027re Catholics. It seemed like there wasn\u0027t a whole lot that we had to talk about. But we never have any trouble.",
        "At first, we were writing every day. We were both so excited about this. And now, we\u0027re usually in touch at least once a week. And we visited. And he\u0027s in Oregon. We\u0027re in Ohio. Visited in Portland last year and spent a couple days with him and had a wonderful time. And they\u0027re, like, 30 years younger than we are. So we\u0027ve become Mom and Dad. And we\u0027ve adopted them. They call them our illegally adopted children. And in December, when I had a serious operation, he was on the phone every night just like the rest of our kids. So he\u0027s really become one of our kids.",
        "Oh, I don\u0027t remember. I just remember indicating that I was 70. So I didn\u0027t want anybody to think we were going to have this big romance or anything. Because, you know, you read these stories about people doing weird things with people on the internet. We never had that problem. We have seven children. And all of them have email except one. And the ones out of town we hear from a couple times a week. One of our daughters we hear from almost daily.",
        "Oh, no. No, we would talk on the phone maybe once a month. And it was always, \"How are you?\" And you never really were part of their lives that way. Two of our children live in Boston. And while we were always close, we weren\u0027t communicating very often.",
        "Oh, it\u0027s wonderful. I keep trying to talk everybody I know into it if their children have access to a computer. It\u0027s changed our lives a lot. It\u0027s just changed our lives. I wouldn\u0027t think of not checking the computer first thing in the morning to see who\u0027s writing."

        "This one I\u0027m going to read now is a website of this guy who\u0027s building an aluminum ball, ball of aluminum foil. And he went into quite a bit of detail about this ball. He says, \"I don\u0027t remember exactly how the ball began, but it is a sphere, composed entirely of aluminum foil of various varieties. It is mostly candy wrappers with a few bits of foil and other food items mixed in. So far, the best finish coat is York Peppermint Pattie wrappers. Other foil is fine, but a coat of Peppermint Pattie wrappers is necessary to keep it on. Gum wrappers also tend to have their quality. But they are far too difficult to peel, considering the minimal bulk they have. Gum wrappers do make a good finish coat on top of Peppermint Pattie wrappers for show. Some items, such as Hershey\u0027s Miniatures, which look like they might be good candidates for foil, aren\u0027t. The ball is more impressive in person than this page can hope to depict.\"",
        "Oh, there is, if you can see it. And then, he has this diary of its growth. It starts back in January. And he says, \"We\u0027ve gotten an electric postage scale in the office. It reads one more digit of precision, so we now have a weight of 3.9 ounces. I have done the math to compute the density of the ball. Curiously, it is much lower than that of solid aluminum. I have a hard time believing that the ball is less than half aluminum by mass, so I invite you to let me know if there are any errors in my computations. I expected that the density would be less than that of solid aluminum because of a small amount of air between layers of the foil, the adhesive coatings, inks, and small quantities of chocolate, grease, and other leftovers from the food items that the wrappers were originally used to package. I wouldn\u0027t have been too surprised by 5 or even 10% difference. But I find the actual results obtained a little difficult to believe.\"",
        "I think so.",
        "The other interesting thing is, on this, he has links to other sites that are making aluminum foil balls, and someone also who\u0027s making a rubber band ball."

        "At that point, it goes on the other person\u0027s comfortability. I have no problem doing that. And that\u0027s the whole point of the camera, is that it\u0027s whatever I\u0027m doing. When I went into this, I understood that in order to make it really work, it would have to be no matter what I was doing. But I can\u0027t really enforce that on people who are visiting me. So if the other person is uncomfortable, then the camera is turned off or it points to a different part of the room.",
        "Yes. Yes.",
        "Yes, in fact. And the funny thing is that it never actually was broadcast, because the number of people suddenly reloading on the server ended up crashing the computer that posted the JenniCam at the time.",
        "So even though we were there and the camera was on, the server was crashed by the number of people wanting to see.",
        "Oh, I don\u0027t know. Mostly men. It\u0027s almost exclusively men. I get about 700 emails a day. And of that number, maybe 10 are from women.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, a lot of those are entries to a contest on my web page called \"Name That Curve,\" where, once a week, I put up a new picture of some closeup shot of a part of my body, and people guess what it is. So I would say 300 or so of that number are \"Name That Curve\" entries. The rest of them are people saying either, \"I saw your web page. I like your page,\" or \"Can I call you?\" Or \"Can you send me private, special pictures?\" It really, really ranges.",
        "I do get a fair number at this point of requests for autographed pictures and people wanting to buy my hair and my clothing, things like that.",
        "It\u0027s pretty scary. Well, one time, I was caught on camera actually trimming my bangs, because if you\u0027re going to do that, it\u0027s cheaper. And all of a sudden, I got 40 emails from people saying, \"Are you going to do anything with that hair? Can I buy it from you?\"",
        "Well, I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s kind of scary. I do meet people from time to time. Somebody\u0027ll say, \"I\u0027m passing through the area. Do you think I could meet you?\"",
        "I actually have a pretty good knack for getting a good feeling about people right off the bat. So sometimes I say no. Sometimes I say yes. I\u0027ve had dinner with, oh, probably a dozen people from the JenniCam.",
        "I had one person who had a hard time taking no for an answer, even after I made it abundantly clear I wasn\u0027t interested.",
        "It is, kind of. I\u0027ve had a fair number of improper passes at the end of the evening. But it stays at a pass.",
        "I don\u0027t think so. I don\u0027t think I would, because if you have the TV, you have other things you can watch. I think it would still be popular. But I think at that point, it would be a lot less interesting, because people can do this from their offices. At work, if they have internet usage that\u0027s not monitored from work, you can just put it on and leave it on in the background while you\u0027re doing whatever else on your computer.",
        "There\u0027s the regular part of my page, I guess you would say, with information about me, the music I like, things like that, like everybody has on their page. The one item that has become extremely popular, though, is the JenniCam. And it\u0027s just a camera that sits in my room and takes a picture every three minutes and uploads it. So every three minutes, you can find out what fascinating thing I\u0027m doing in my room.",
        "People, I\u0027m not sure. But as far as number of hits go, we get over 500,000 hits a day.",
        "Nothing, really. I write email, I sleep, I have friends over. You can watch my hedgehog when I\u0027m not in the room. Things like that. Pretty much just regular college life, as far as I know.",
        "I talk on the phone a lot.",
        "I would have to agree. I would absolutely agree. I don\u0027t do anything that\u0027s that interesting. I don\u0027t have company very often. I don\u0027t do anything more interesting, really, than talk on the phone, watch TV, and sleep.",
        "Well, whenever I\u0027m nude in my room, I\u0027m nude on the JenniCam.",
        "Well, maybe I\u0027m not an average person. But I figure when I\u0027m alone, who really cares? I sleep naked, and I get changed. And when I get out of the shower, I\u0027m all wet. There\u0027s no hurry to put on clothes.",
        "Actually, with the camera there, I don\u0027t think about it much. So whenever I\u0027m normally naked in my room, that\u0027s when I would be on the camera. It really doesn\u0027t affect me in much of a big way, I would say.",
        "I think the camera would be a lot less interesting if I paid that much attention to it. It would be more of a staged show. And you can go see a staged show anywhere. I think the whole appeal of the camera is that it is whatever is normally going on in my room. And with it having been up for a year and a half now, I\u0027m pretty accustomed to it being there. It doesn\u0027t affect me much, I would say.",
        "Actually, it goes sort of the opposite way. Whenever I go home for breaks, for spring break or something like that, I\u0027m always sad to be away from the camera. It\u0027s really a different feeling. Whenever I\u0027m in the room and the camera is broken for some reason, my room feels totally different. It\u0027s like I\u0027m completely alone. I usually prefer the camera be there. And I\u0027m sad when it\u0027s off as opposed to wishing it weren\u0027t there.",
        "Right. Even though there\u0027s nobody actually there with me, even though I\u0027m still alone, even if there\u0027s nobody watching the camera from the other end, it\u0027s just comforting to know that there is somebody metaphorically out there.",
        "A lot of the people, it\u0027s totally hoping to find me getting out of the shower, getting dressed for bed, things like that. It\u0027s hoping to find the nudity. But I get lots of email from people who say that it\u0027s just nice, when they\u0027re alone in their office, to know that there\u0027s somebody else out there, somebody else that is doing nothing more interesting than what they\u0027re doing at the same time. It\u0027s like having a little virtual friend.",

In preparation for this show, we spent many hours surfing the net together and finding files that we thought were interesting. And Joe\u0027s going to come up and read some. Wait a minute, Joe, let me get this timer going, here. I\u0027ve got to put these other ones in different places.",

            "I came across a Usenet group called alt.amazonwomen.admirers. And this is a short dialogue between two guys.",
            "Guy one: \"I was just talking with someone. And we started thinking about a couple of girls we know that used to give us piggyback rides. Here\u0027s an interesting thought. One girl was, like, 5\u00272\", weighed 110 pounds. She wasn\u0027t a great athlete and didn\u0027t have a lot of muscle, and she was able to give me piggyback rides with ease, while I weigh close to 200 pounds. So with that thought in mind, I\u0027m curious to know, assuming you believe that piggyback rides are the easiest way to lift a person, which they are, how much weight would you guess some fitness and body building women could lift piggyback? I mean, if they can lift 200-pound guys over their shoulders and press them overhead, just imagine how much they could lift piggyback. Any thoughts?\"",
            "So the response to that is, \"Yeah, here\u0027s a thought. Where are the lift-a-200-pound-man-overhead-and-press-him women? Boy, would I ever like to see that. I mean, who cares about piggyback rides? A piggyback ride isn\u0027t a lift at all. The man just climbs on. And all the weight is supported by the bones of the legs, because the legs are already locked out. Not impressive, not sexy. But to see a woman militarily press a man, now, that\u0027s worth paying to see. My greatest thrill would be to see a tall, muscular woman pick up a tiny man under his armpits and dangle him in midair. Impossible, you say? Maybe. But consider this. In 1988, the women\u0027s weightlifting championships were dominated by young, teenage girls. I saw a 16-year-old Chinese girl snatch 165 pounds as though it were a feather. She cleaned and jerked 231 pounds without so much as making a face. She weighed 132 pounds. Try this, guys. Go to your garage and load up that old barbell with, say, 270 pounds. Try to dead-lift it. See how heavy it feels. Now, picture a cute, 17-year-old 99-pound pound Chinese girl take that same barbell and lift it all the way overhead in about five seconds.\" So the response to that is, \"Yes, I agree. Now we\u0027re getting close to the real thing.\" Thank you.",

            "OK, this is a romance story. I met this guy last fall. And he worked most of the week in another part of the country. He would fly out on Sunday night and come back on Thursday night. So our romance was conducted through the net. And because he was away so much, we talked or emailed back and forth every day.",
            "And I don\u0027t know if other people have had this experience, but if you start going out with someone and you\u0027re writing them over the net, it\u0027s very exciting. You come home, and you turn on the computer, and it\u0027s one of the first things that you think about. And it really adds this element that, I don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve never had before.",
            "So anyway, we went out for about three or four months. And we fell in love. But eventually, we started to have problems. Our daily correspondence became more and more strained. And finally, I wrote him this email that I\u0027m going to read to you.",
            "\"Dear Sam, I feel like I\u0027m making you feel worse, and I can\u0027t bear that. I am so sorry. I think that you should have peace. And I pray for you. I pray for that for you every day. I think you should take some time and call me when you do feel more peace.\"",
            "So this was very heartfelt. And I did think that he would write me back. And after about two and a half weeks, he hadn\u0027t written me. And this was a dramatic departure for us.",
            "And so when we finally did talk, it was like Vietnam. There was about 36 hours of a intense meltdown. And I fired out five hysterical emails, which I won\u0027t read to you. And we broke up. And while we were breaking up, my computer crashed. And I lost all of my email. And so I lost all of this correspondence from him, which was 100 pages, easily. And I wrote him. And I told them about this. And he sent me two caches of folders, his mail and my mail.",
            "Well, at that time, I didn\u0027t want to read through all of this. It was a little too painful. I just wanted it. I wanted to have it. So when I prepared for this show tonight, I decided to go back and read through it. And I discovered something, which was that he did email me back. I just never got it. And part of the hell-- I was in hell for those two or three weeks before we talked.",
            "So this is what he emailed me that I discovered. It said, \"Dolores, you are so good a person. I\u0027m very proud to know you and have you in my life. I will take some time and get grounded, and then call you. Thanks for all your love and understanding.\" Well, I was flabbergasted. It took me several days to even wrap my mind around the fact that he had sent this. And it completely altered my experience of that time and of him. And I still can\u0027t quite assimilate it, really.",
            "Now, this is the question that every man I tell this story to asks me. It didn\u0027t occur to me. And he would have had to have gone through quite a bit of trouble to do it, because it is encoded with all of the information. I don\u0027t know. What do you think?",

And when I talked to her, on the one hand, there seemed to be something completely innocent in what she was doing, putting herself out there and not really caring who sees. And if you press her about her own exhibitionism, she\u0027ll tell you over and over, \"Oh, no, no, no. It\u0027s not about exhibitionism. It\u0027s an experiment in letting people view a person\u0027s entire life without editing.\" The one thing that she\u0027s gotten on the internet that she could never have gotten so easily any other way is she\u0027s famous within a small circle.

But this week, we are trying something different. We\u0027re broadcasting from the Museum of Contemporary Art, here in Chicago, where we\u0027re taking what geologists might call a core sample of things happening on the internet, a very unscientific sample. How are people using the net? What is happening on the net that is not happening anywhere else or has not happened anywhere else?",

And when he got Mrs. Kiefer\u0027s email in his account, the thing that actually got to him was that she signed it, \"Love, Mom.\" His own mother had just died two months before. His father had been dead for years. Mrs. Kiefer said she never intended or wanted to have a long-term email friendship.",

            "Well, as we looked for those stories from the net for this show, especially stories of things happened on that net might not happen anywhere else, we found Earl Jackson. He\u0027s an associate professor of Comparative Literature at the University of California at Santa Cruz. And he spends a lot of time on the net. He writes about the net, has seven websites himself. And he tells the story, which begins on America Online.",

            "For all the hype about the revolutionary changes the internet is going to bring us, what\u0027s striking about this particular story is how much of it could have happened without computers at all. All across America, teenage boys kiss young women on a date or two, then freak out and withdraw. All the computer adds is an air of mystery and intimacy and some exotic stage props for the drama. Otherwise, the lines and the moves are very, very old.",
            "And so he says to you-- at what point in the evening did he say, \"I\u0027m going to go home now?\"",
            "Back in December of 1993, Earl Jackson met a guy over the net in one of these gay chat rooms. The guy\u0027s name was Ken, lived nearby. But he had a boyfriend. So the two never met in person. But almost every day for a year, they got online together and created these elaborate fantasies together online, using that kind of software where you can see what the other person types as they type it, and they can see what you type as you type it.",
            "You could tell even the way he was typing was different?",
            "What do you mean?",

            "Well, the question we pose in this hour is, what is happening on the internet? And are there things happening on the net that never would have happened without it? Over the past few weeks, we\u0027ve advertised in cities around the country, inviting radio listeners to send us samples of their own emails, samples of things they\u0027ve found on the net that they thought were especially interesting or amusing. We have advertised here in Chicago, asking people to come here today, to the museum of contemporary art, with those samples. And over the next hour, we\u0027ll hear from people here and people around the country, an unscientific sampling of what\u0027s going on on the net. Stay with us.",
            "My co-host for today\u0027s show is David Hauptschein. Welcome, David. David is a playwright and novelist. His played \"Trance\" won the Fringe First Award at the Edinburgh Theatre Festival and was produced for the Brighton Arts Festival. His play \"The Persecution of Arnold Petch\" premiered this year at Red Orchid Theater here in Chicago. And years ago, David started having these shows that he called \"letter shows,\" where he invited people onstage to bring their mail to a theater and read it, just as kind of a big open mic. And we\u0027re adapting the format of those shows to the electronic media today. David, why don\u0027t you explain the rules of how one of these shows goes.",

            "My name is Noel, and I\u0027m diastematic. Anybody here know what that means? It means that I have a gap between my front two teeth. For those of you unfamiliar with this whole website gap-tooth thing, I built a website for gap-tooth people. So, yeah, idiotic. You want it, you\u0027ve got it. But I\u0027m in good company. 10% of America, including David Letterman, Lauren Hutton, Noam Chomsky, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, Itzhak Perlman, Chaucer\u0027s Wife of Bath, Vince Lombardi, blah, blah, blah, all with two cleavage. I must admit, for better or for worse, yes, I\u0027m the one who built this website. But the emphasis is humor.",
            "In early November last year--",
            "Absolutely.",
            "This will hit on a lot of those themes. In the early November last year, I was watching a Bears-Packers game. And during the pregame ceremonies, the USPS, the post office, unveiled art for a new stamp, due this summer, featuring the late great Vince Lombardi, who was one of the greatest gappers ever to live. He was on a stamp, riding high atop the team in the throes of victory, smiling huge. But something was missing, Coach Lombardi\u0027s trademark gap-toothed grin. He had near-perfect pearly whites, and the gap was gone.",
            "The next day, as a joke, I added a page to the gap-tooth website, protesting the post office\u0027s depiction of Lombardi as a cosmetically-altered hero. Who would Don King be if he were bald? Or Gorbachev without the Kool-Aid stain? Or Jimmy Durante without that nose?",
            "So knowing that this was one small effort to have a little fun while making a point, knowing that this was the Web, the oddball media that gets no real merit for its content, I expected little to no attention. But then came Yahoo, which featured it as a weekly pick. The Washington Post had me on the phone and ran a half-page story with my before and after pics. Chicago\u0027s Channel 7 came to my apartment and ran a story on its 6 o\u0027clock news just for the Super Bowl.",
            "Getting out of hand? Yeah, timeout. If you\u0027re thinking this pathetic web-based protest should never have received any attention, I\u0027m in agreement with you. What was ironic about this story is that they painted me as a freak-- imagine that-- a superfan, ready to strap myself with bombs and blow up my teeth and Washington, D.C., if they didn\u0027t change the art. And it was all pretty much lighthearted.",
            "So Bob, the artist of the postage stamp, latched back to the AP. And I thought, this is just fun. I mean, I\u0027m just running a website for gap-toothed people. You can\u0027t take me that seriously. So I called up Bob, and we talked about the stamp. We discussed angles and art representation. He was a really nice guy. I was thinking about dropping the protest already when he told me his three-year-old daughter was gap-toothed.",
            "And that was it. Protest over. But what still gets me today is that the Web has the power to make insignificant things seem real, that email can really serve as a powerful form of protest, which it did in this case, and that people, including myself, really do have too much time on their hands."

            "OK. A former friend of mine from high school is currently living with her husband and son in England. And every three weeks or so, she sends out what I call a broadcast email. And she sends it to what has now become 56 email addresses. I\u0027m going to read one of the broadcast emails. But before I do, I think I should make two notes. One is that she refers to her husband as \"Bobo\" or \"Bo.\" And she refers to her son as \"Boo\" because she named him after Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird.",
            "Granted, that is his nickname. So she also rates her adventures with \"paws,\" like bear paws. And for example, once, after visiting the Stratford on Avon, she said, \"Three paws for Shakespeareville.\" So here\u0027s the first one that I ever received.",
            "\"Hi. Baby Boo had his first day in London this weekend. We went to the British Museum, a quick stop to Harod\u0027s, and really quick stops to Big Ben and Westminster Abbey to take pictures. We bought a six-foot diameter beach towel that I lay out for Boo to play on. I told him that it\u0027s his boundary, and if he crawls off it, he\u0027ll get electrocuted from the wires. You know, like those dog training things. Well, he does a good job of keeping me on my feet now. Before, I had to watch him every second. Now, I have to watch him every millisecond.\"",
            "Exactly. But this comes-- I think I\u0027ve received these over the last year. And these come fairly regularly, like once a month.",
            "Well, actually, what\u0027s really interesting is that she and I have grown apart. And I didn\u0027t really quite know how to end the relationship. But these emails have actually given me some closure, because--",
            "I don\u0027t say anything. It used to-- [DING]",
            "Oh, ok. And I never have to say anything. I never respond to them. But she continues to send them to me, and I have a lot of fun reading them. And before, I used to feel really guilty. Like I wouldn\u0027t respond to her letters or I wouldn\u0027t be a good friend. But now, I feel like, OK, well, we\u0027re just so different.",
            "Right, right.",
            "Right. And then I just read it. And actually-- I\u0027m really horrible, and I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m going to admit this-- but I actually send it out to two of my other friends, who also-- [LAUGHTER] I forward it to two other friends, who are sitting out there. And they read it and comment back to me. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this.",

There\u0027s a 24-hour bulletin board that I was observing for this study was doing, where you could almost be guaranteed that, if you lived in San Francisco and you had a modem, you could have sex any time of the day or night. This was a very goal-directed bulletin board.",
            "Right. And you would know exactly what they wanted to do. And you\u0027d probably have nude pictures of them before that. What I also thought was really interesting-- and this was more true of AOL-- that there was a new metaphysics of sexuality, because people would talk about cybersex or real sex. And it occurred to me, after I listened to enough, by real sex, they meant phone sex.",

            "It\u0027s true. There\u0027s an entire culture that\u0027s entirely video transmission sexuality now.",
            "Yeah, me, in fact. Yes.",
            "Yeah, they left me. But he said that that is what he does lately. And I understood that, because a lot of men are afraid of sexual contact because of AIDS. So the perfect thing to eroticize is distance.",
            "Pretty soon. He said that he really needed to do the CU-SeeMe stuff.",
            "We would have a fantasy about, what if he came to my classroom and then I took him back into my office? But it was really sort of a game. But these narratives became so intense that we would set times of the day, or he would just check in. And he said, \"Do you have time for a story now?\" And he would start it. And then I\u0027d continue it. And we have all of these stories.",
            "But as we kept doing this, then a little part of his life would come in. And then there would be a story that we take us somewhere else. And then I\u0027d know a little bit more. And soon, the sex part was really an excuse to tell the other stories. And sometimes, he would be telling this story about his childhood in Missouri. And then it would remind him of a social fantasy. And then he\u0027d put me in it. And you couldn\u0027t plan to do these things. We became sort of like jazz pianists or something. We\u0027d have these riffs together.",
            "Then one day, he was asking me if I had time to talk to him. And I was just leaving. But I could tell that even the way he was typing was different.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "People have different habits in their speed or the way he would respond or if he didn\u0027t put a smiley face after a certain number words. I just knew there was something really wrong with the way he asked me if I had time. And he said, \"Bad news, son.\" And I think I knew instantly what that was. He had tested positive. And he didn\u0027t know how to break it to me. And our messages to each other then became a lot more about that and about what happened to him as a child and other things that were fairly tragic and amazing that he was telling anybody, because he was really one of the strong, silent types.",
            "Then-- this is when I should have gotten more nervous-- he started saying that he didn\u0027t want any of his porn tapes anymore, because he associated porn with him being positive. So he wanted to mail them to me. And he mailed me a box of them. I didn\u0027t really want them, but he wanted to do this for me. So there was suddenly a box of porn tapes in my house. And then the following week, there was one, too.",
            "And just before I got back to San Francisco, I got a message from him, hoping that I was well and hoping I got the tapes. And he said that I\u0027d get another message very soon. Now, he was writing to me almost entirely in capital letters, which scared me. And I didn\u0027t know why. But here\u0027s the last one. \"I have it all boxed up now. I will give it to my friend. He will mail it for me like he did before. And it will arrive either Thursday or Friday via two-day express. I have a letter coming to you to help explain a few things. Thank you for being a friend when I really needed it. Kenneth.\"",
            "And then, three days, nothing. And then there\u0027s just one line. \"A package should arrive today, 1/19/95. Email me. Cruiser3. Bye. Love, Ken. And then on the 25th, there was one that looked like it was from Ken. It was his screen name. But then, when I opened it up, it said, \"This is a hard note for me to write. Ken left a note to ask me to let you know. Ken took his own life on Friday, January 20. He was cremated yesterday, and his ashes will be dropped into the ocean off San Francisco today. Ken\u0027s mental attitude over the last four to six weeks is very hard to describe. He was a basket case, to say the least. I will keep his account open for the next day if you have any questions or response, and I will try to answer them for you. Ken\u0027s friend, Dave.\"",
            "Yeah. It was the only time I ever saw his handwriting. And that said similar things to this. it was just, \"Thank you for being a friend when I needed it. And I will always love you.\"",
            "It was. And what was really odd was that, when he first sent the first box of tapes, he told me which tape had a scene where the two people are the ones that he imagined us to be. Now, that doesn\u0027t mean that he looked like either one of them. But he knew the fantasy scenario that would resonate with us. So even at that point, our fantasies were constantly mediated by some other technology. And-- which is probably hard for you to imagine-- but none of this cold. There was something so tender about this that I was very moved by this experience.",
            "Yes, I did. Yes.",
            "Yeah, although it\u0027s real. When people say, oh, the computers are making us all isolated and it\u0027s such a cold world, I\u0027ve had emotional experiences and long-term friendships that would have never been possible otherwise.",
            "But he would be such a creep that-- I thought of that, actually, because it seemed almost like a melodrama from a long time ago. It was really tawdry. And if I wrote a short story, I wouldn\u0027t end it this way, because it was too hokey.",
            "Yes. Yeah, he really felt gone. He really felt gone. When I saw somebody else using his screen name, to get a stranger with his screen name, that was really, really chilling."

But none of our friends knew each other, so he couldn\u0027t meet me. And what he ended up doing was obsessing about my photo and deciding, well, I can\u0027t just obsess about her photo. I\u0027d like to know more about her as a person.",

And they just made stuff up. But it was very positive, because what happened was, he ended up writing me a letter on paper, using quotes about all the things that people had said about me, that I was cheerful and intelligent and had a good disposition. He decided I was a rare commodity. I should call him. And I was kind of cornered into calling him by my friends. But this is a story that went nowhere, because he was truly not someone I wanted to end up going out with.",

We\u0027re in Ohio. Visited in Portland last year and spent a couple days with him and had a wonderful time. And they\u0027re, like, 30 years younger than we are. So we\u0027ve become Mom and Dad. And we\u0027ve adopted them. They call them our illegally adopted children. And in December, when I had a serious operation, he was on the phone every night just like the rest of our kids.

Because, you know, you read these stories about people doing weird things with people on the internet. We never had that problem. We have seven children. And all of them have email except one. And the ones out of town we hear from a couple times a week. One of our daughters we hear from almost daily.",

            "This one I\u0027m going to read now is a website of this guy who\u0027s building an aluminum ball, ball of aluminum foil. And he went into quite a bit of detail about this ball. He says, \"I don\u0027t remember exactly how the ball began, but it is a sphere, composed entirely of aluminum foil of various varieties. It is mostly candy wrappers with a few bits of foil and other food items mixed in. So far, the best finish coat is York Peppermint Pattie wrappers. Other foil is fine, but a coat of Peppermint Pattie wrappers is necessary to keep it on. Gum wrappers also tend to have their quality. But they are far too difficult to peel, considering the minimal bulk they have. Gum wrappers do make a good finish coat on top of Peppermint Pattie wrappers for show. Some items, such as Hershey\u0027s Miniatures, which look like they might be good candidates for foil, aren\u0027t. The ball is more impressive in person than this page can hope to depict.\"",
            "Oh, there is, if you can see it. And then, he has this diary of its growth. It starts back in January. And he says, \"We\u0027ve gotten an electric postage scale in the office. It reads one more digit of precision, so we now have a weight of 3.9 ounces. I have done the math to compute the density of the ball. Curiously, it is much lower than that of solid aluminum. I have a hard time believing that the ball is less than half aluminum by mass, so I invite you to let me know if there are any errors in my computations. I expected that the density would be less than that of solid aluminum because of a small amount of air between layers of the foil, the adhesive coatings, inks, and small quantities of chocolate, grease, and other leftovers from the food items that the wrappers were originally used to package. I wouldn\u0027t have been too surprised by 5 or even 10% difference. But I find the actual results obtained a little difficult to believe.\"",
            "I think so.",
            "The other interesting thing is, on this, he has links to other sites that are making aluminum foil balls, and someone also who\u0027s making a rubber band ball."

            "At that point, it goes on the other person\u0027s comfortability. I have no problem doing that. And that\u0027s the whole point of the camera, is that it\u0027s whatever I\u0027m doing. When I went into this, I understood that in order to make it really work, it would have to be no matter what I was doing. But I can\u0027t really enforce that on people who are visiting me. So if the other person is uncomfortable, then the camera is turned off or it points to a different part of the room.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "Yes, in fact. And the funny thing is that it never actually was broadcast, because the number of people suddenly reloading on the server ended up crashing the computer that posted the JenniCam at the time.",
            "So even though we were there and the camera was on, the server was crashed by the number of people wanting to see.",
            "Oh, I don\u0027t know. Mostly men. It\u0027s almost exclusively men. I get about 700 emails a day. And of that number, maybe 10 are from women.",
            "Right.",
            "Well, a lot of those are entries to a contest on my web page called \"Name That Curve,\" where, once a week, I put up a new picture of some closeup shot of a part of my body, and people guess what it is. So I would say 300 or so of that number are \"Name That Curve\" entries. The rest of them are people saying either, \"I saw your web page. I like your page,\" or \"Can I call you?\" Or \"Can you send me private, special pictures?\" It really, really ranges.",
            "I do get a fair number at this point of requests for autographed pictures and people wanting to buy my hair and my clothing, things like that.",
            "It\u0027s pretty scary. Well, one time, I was caught on camera actually trimming my bangs, because if you\u0027re going to do that, it\u0027s cheaper. And all of a sudden, I got 40 emails from people saying, \"Are you going to do anything with that hair? Can I buy it from you?\"",
            "Well, I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s kind of scary. I do meet people from time to time. Somebody\u0027ll say, \"I\u0027m passing through the area. Do you think I could meet you?\"",
            "I actually have a pretty good knack for getting a good feeling about people right off the bat. So sometimes I say no. Sometimes I say yes. I\u0027ve had dinner with, oh, probably a dozen people from the JenniCam.",
            "I had one person who had a hard time taking no for an answer, even after I made it abundantly clear I wasn\u0027t interested.",
            "It is, kind of. I\u0027ve had a fair number of improper passes at the end of the evening. But it stays at a pass.",
            "I don\u0027t think so. I don\u0027t think I would, because if you have the TV, you have other things you can watch. I think it would still be popular. But I think at that point, it would be a lot less interesting, because people can do this from their offices. At work, if they have internet usage that\u0027s not monitored from work, you can just put it on and leave it on in the background while you\u0027re doing whatever else on your computer.",
            "There\u0027s the regular part of my page, I guess you would say, with information about me, the music I like, things like that, like everybody has on their page. The one item that has become extremely popular, though, is the JenniCam. And it\u0027s just a camera that sits in my room and takes a picture every three minutes and uploads it. So every three minutes, you can find out what fascinating thing I\u0027m doing in my room.",
            "People, I\u0027m not sure. But as far as number of hits go, we get over 500,000 hits a day.",
            "Nothing, really. I write email, I sleep, I have friends over. You can watch my hedgehog when I\u0027m not in the room. Things like that. Pretty much just regular college life, as far as I know.",
            "I talk on the phone a lot.",
            "I would have to agree. I would absolutely agree. I don\u0027t do anything that\u0027s that interesting. I don\u0027t have company very often. I don\u0027t do anything more interesting, really, than talk on the phone, watch TV, and sleep.",
            "Well, whenever I\u0027m nude in my room, I\u0027m nude on the JenniCam.",
            "Well, maybe I\u0027m not an average person. But I figure when I\u0027m alone, who really cares? I sleep naked, and I get changed. And when I get out of the shower, I\u0027m all wet. There\u0027s no hurry to put on clothes.",
            "Actually, with the camera there, I don\u0027t think about it much. So whenever I\u0027m normally naked in my room, that\u0027s when I would be on the camera. It really doesn\u0027t affect me in much of a big way, I would say.",
            "I think the camera would be a lot less interesting if I paid that much attention to it. It would be more of a staged show. And you can go see a staged show anywhere. I think the whole appeal of the camera is that it is whatever is normally going on in my room. And with it having been up for a year and a half now, I\u0027m pretty accustomed to it being there. It doesn\u0027t affect me much, I would say.",
            "Actually, it goes sort of the opposite way. Whenever I go home for breaks, for spring break or something like that, I\u0027m always sad to be away from the camera. It\u0027s really a different feeling. Whenever I\u0027m in the room and the camera is broken for some reason, my room feels totally different. It\u0027s like I\u0027m completely alone. I usually prefer the camera be there. And I\u0027m sad when it\u0027s off as opposed to wishing it weren\u0027t there.",
            "Right. Even though there\u0027s nobody actually there with me, even though I\u0027m still alone, even if there\u0027s nobody watching the camera from the other end, it\u0027s just comforting to know that there is somebody metaphorically out there.",
            "A lot of the people, it\u0027s totally hoping to find me getting out of the shower, getting dressed for bed, things like that. It\u0027s hoping to find the nudity. But I get lots of email from people who say that it\u0027s just nice, when they\u0027re alone in their office, to know that there\u0027s somebody else out there, somebody else that is doing nothing more interesting than what they\u0027re doing at the same time. It\u0027s like having a little virtual friend.",
            "Sure."

One girl was, like, 5\u00272\", weighed 110 pounds. She wasn\u0027t a great athlete and didn\u0027t have a lot of muscle, and she was able to give me piggyback rides with ease, while I weigh close to 200 pounds. So with that thought in mind, I\u0027m curious to know, assuming you believe that piggyback rides are the easiest way to lift a person, which they are, how much weight would you guess some fitness and body building women could lift piggyback? I mean, if they can lift 200-pound guys over their shoulders and press them overhead, just imagine how much they could lift piggyback. Any thoughts?\""

I mean, who cares about piggyback rides? A piggyback ride isn\u0027t a lift at all. The man just climbs on. And all the weight is supported by the bones of the legs, because the legs are already locked out. Not impressive, not sexy. But to see a woman militarily press a man, now, that\u0027s worth paying to see. My greatest thrill would be to see a tall, muscular woman pick up a tiny man under his armpits and dangle him in midair. Impossible, you say? Maybe. But consider this. In 1988, the women\u0027s weightlifting championships were dominated by young, teenage girls. I saw a 16-year-old Chinese girl snatch 165 pounds as though it were a feather. She cleaned and jerked 231 pounds without so much as making a face. She weighed 132 pounds. Try this, guys. Go to your garage and load up that old barbell with, say, 270 pounds. Try to dead-lift it. See how heavy it feels. Now, picture a cute, 17-year-old 99-pound pound Chinese girl take that same barbell and lift it all the way overhead in about five seconds.\" So the response to that is, \"Yes, I agree. Now we\u0027re getting close to the real thing.\" Thank you."

We have advertised here in Chicago, asking people to come here today, to the museum of contemporary art, with those samples. And over the next hour, we\u0027ll hear from people here and people around the country, an unscientific sampling of what\u0027s going on on the net. Stay with us."

It is mostly candy wrappers with a few bits of foil and other food items mixed in. So far, the best finish coat is York Peppermint Pattie wrappers. Other foil is fine, but a coat of Peppermint Pattie wrappers is necessary to keep it on. Gum wrappers also tend to have their quality. But they are far too difficult to peel, considering the minimal bulk they have. Gum wrappers do make a good finish coat on top of Peppermint Pattie wrappers for show. Some items, such as Hershey\u0027s Miniatures, which look like they might be good candidates for foil, aren\u0027t. The ball is more impressive in person than this page can hope to depict.\""

It reads one more digit of precision, so we now have a weight of 3.9 ounces. I have done the math to compute the density of the ball. Curiously, it is much lower than that of solid aluminum. I have a hard time believing that the ball is less than half aluminum by mass, so I invite you to let me know if there are any errors in my computations. I expected that the density would be less than that of solid aluminum because of a small amount of air between layers of the foil, the adhesive coatings, inks, and small quantities of chocolate, grease, and other leftovers from the food items that the wrappers were originally used to package. I wouldn\u0027t have been too surprised by 5 or even 10% difference. But I find the actual results obtained a little difficult to believe.\""
