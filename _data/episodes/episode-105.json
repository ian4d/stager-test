And he was hopeful for better. He wanted what I think is the bigger and, in some ways, more important thing to occur in this MIT program when he took it over seven or eight years before Cedric got there. He wanted kids like Cedric, 50 kids like Cedric instead of one or two.","And what he realized early on is that it would run into all manner of dilemmas that go right to the core of some of the problems with the notion of Affirmative Action. MIT sponsors the program. MIT wants as many of these kids as possible to eventually end up in their freshman class to make that freshman class look like a rainbow, as they say.","And as people might mention, you can make the Ivy League, or any great college, look like a rainbow nowadays without ever having to go to the ghetto. You don\u0027t have to go there. There are plenty of middle and upper-middle-class black and Latino kids to fill those programs, kids who will eventually succeed at a top university. It\u0027s the other kids, kids like Cedric, for whom the distance is so vast to travel that for them, the failure rate is untenable for a place like MIT.","Absolutely. And they often have very big dreams, and they often come pushed forward by a whole community for whom they\u0027re the one who\u0027s going to make it. And that\u0027s a pretty heavy burden to carry to a place like MIT and then have all of that come crashing down on their head. Look, as Ramsey said, he said, look, the suicide rates up here are high enough as they are.","Ira, they just had utterly distinct ways of doing everything. Cedric\u0027s general heightened hygiene of having grown up in often squalid places, where Cedric was cleaning all the time. Cedric was always careful about how he looked and that he himself and his person was very clean. It was the opposite from Rob who never worried. This was just one of 1,000 things like that that immediately gripped the two of them in the room until the point where they almost came to blows.","But the thing, Ira, if you go into Cedric\u0027s church and you go into Cedric\u0027s environment, the only reason Cedric has got where he got is because he didn\u0027t taste of any of the plates at the buffet table of adolescent life in Southeast. Most of those plates are poisoned.","OK. \"Clearly, some East Andrews residents are spending serious time and energy having fun. Despite Brown\u0027s self consciousness about each student\u0027s individuality, the four preferred pastimes are the same here as they are at almost every other college-- drink beer, smoke pot, dance to deafening music until you drop, and on the rare occasion, get naked with some other warm body.","Possibly the best explanation why Cedric Jennings is in Brown\u0027s class of 1999 is that he managed to steer clear of the buffet table of adolescent experimentation, believing rightly, it turns out, that in his neighborhood, most of those dishes were poisoned. This was an extraordinary feat, considering how peer pressure at Ballou was backed up by violence. And the almost irresistible urge for teenagers to salve deep despair with sex, drugs, and music.","Cedric knows all this, just as he knows his resistance was made possible back when by his mother\u0027s fierce code.

Hello, home. Well, I went to have the tire patched--\"","\"I went to a good play last night, Misalliance by George Bernard Shaw. A friend of mine was in it, but he wasn\u0027t any good. I went with Richard Robinson.\" Oh! \"A track runner, singer, dancer, all-around good looker, religious, and liked by everyone. He\u0027s one of the nicest people I know. And he\u0027s Negro.","I had to tell you. I\u0027ve never kept any secrets from you and this wasn\u0027t going to be one. I hope you\u0027re not angry. Even you would like him. No one minded. Bill Crowell was there and real nice to both of us. I don\u0027t know why there has to be a racial problem anyway. I had so much better time with him than I do with Bob or David [? Kiechle ?] or Bill Crowell or Roger Heckerman and he treated me like a queen. Sad, isn\u0027t it? Please don\u0027t think I\u0027m being a rebel. I love you both very much and am proud to be close enough to my parents to tell them everything, whether or not I know they will disagree with me. I\u0027m sure it makes us all better people. I love you, OK? Love, Julia.","And that was my first experience of really mixing with the black kids, because Clara and I would go to lunch together, or meals together. And I would sit at a table with black kids. And so that was really kind of how it happened.","And then I started going to functions with Clara. Clara would go to the black fraternity and sorority parties and I would go. I don\u0027t know if I would have done that before I went to Europe. I think going to Europe had something to do with it just because it broadened my way of thinking, perhaps. If I hadn\u0027t gone to Europe and been assigned a black roommate, I don\u0027t think it would have happened.","Well, I used to go watch him practice track a lot, which was over here. You want to go over there? Because that was--","You know the other thing that was just kind of hard for me to get used to was that their parties never started until 10:00 at night. At least 10:00, maybe later. And we had dorm curfews then. And I was still a pretty good girl. I didn\u0027t stay out all night. So I had to stay out all night with him because I couldn\u0027t get back into the dorm. And that was an annoyance to me. I always thought, why can\u0027t they start the parties like normal white people do?","[LAUGHTER]","And this is the other thing. Everybody else would be gone on their dates already. And I would be the only person left in the dorm waiting for this black party to start! Me and the black girls left in the dorm. All the white girls are gone already.","I remember exactly how this happened. We were standing in line at the cafeteria, and Richard was so many people in front of us around the corner, like we could see him maybe 30 feet away. And I said, \"Clare, I want you to introduce me to him. He is gorgeous.\" And he has something about his legs. Because he used to wear these faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove. And his muscles were so defined from track that his leg muscles would just bulge through these-- [GIGGLES]. And I wanted to meet him because of his legs. This is terrible. It was totally lust.","I remember very clearly believing that it was going to be a different world, and that-- you know, John F. Kennedy and then Martin Luther King-- that the world was going to change and that we wouldn\u0027t live in a racially divided country anymore. And so I had no doubt at that time that my kids would live in a totally different environment than I had grown up in, that there wouldn\u0027t be any racial prejudice when you guys were growing up.","Oh, this was written the night of our wedding.","\"Tonight is the night, as I guess Janey has told you. We talked to Pastor Stefan Tuesday evening and decided to arrange things for this weekend since the next two weeks are going to be full of study for final exams and moving, we hope. I\u0027m going to wear that pale blue cocktail dress, size 11, it fits me again, and a white mantilla and black patent shoes.","Daddy, I\u0027m sending you my tax statement. Would you rather I fill out the forms? I\u0027m taking Personal Finance next semester which will teach me all about insurance and taxes and things like that. Have you told Grandma and Grandpa yet or Janine and Buddy? Is it all right if I write to the aunts and uncles? Whatever you want me to do is OK, but I\u0027d rather tell everyone now. That\u0027s all for now, I guess. I\u0027m so sorry that this is so hard for you to understand and accept. I know it will be an uphill road from now on, but we could do it. Much love, Jul.\"","And after I was married to him, it didn\u0027t take me very long to realize that it was going to be a fairly successful marriage because his value system was very close to mine. He\u0027s very family oriented. He came from a middle-class upbringing which valued education. And so I didn\u0027t think it was very difficult to be married to him, even though I hadn\u0027t planned to, because the things that I wanted out of a marriage, he wanted too. And just little simple things, like going to the grocery store and being able to pick out food that I knew he was going to eat. I didn\u0027t have to cook chitlins, which-- I guess it was easier than I expected. That\u0027s a stupid example.","But I didn\u0027t have to change anything about the way I already was. Church. He went to church with me every Sunday. He fit right in. When he was in his fraternity, him and his group of fraternity friends, he was very outgoing, funny, loud-- like you are. People laughed when he made jokes. And he could sing really good. And a lot of the fraternity functions, they would have what they called a line. And he was in this little quartet with Arthur-somebody from New York. And John Brooks was in the quartet and somebody else. And they did all these little Temptation numbers where they would dance together.","And so most of the time when I was with him, he was fun to be around. But what was lacking, I guess, the jump between that and getting married was that we never had any conversation. I didn\u0027t know him at all. Other than the fact that we had sex together all the time, it wasn\u0027t like you\u0027d sit down and have long conversations getting to know each other. Because he doesn\u0027t talk. You can\u0027t get to know somebody who doesn\u0027t talk.","That\u0027s right! It would be the same--","\"Robby is so excited about going back. All his friends are there and I don\u0027t think he ever wants to live anywhere else. I want to have a house in the country, but--\" God, I can\u0027t believe I thought I was getting a house in the country near New York!","[LAUGHTER]","Jesus!","\"Say hi--\" I\u0027m telling you, Rich! You don\u0027t understand. I was so small-towny.","No. Obviously not.","I used to think then, I used to think it was very sad. I remember feeling this way. The few times that we went back to New York, he would flip into a whole alter person, second person-- like a schizophrenic personality, a totally different person. We\u0027d go to New York. He\u0027d be hanging out with Poke, laughing. His brother, laughing. His sister, laughing. Drinking a lot, partying, just like I remembered him in college before we got married.","It was like all of a sudden, we\u0027re back in this fraternity party mode again, real easy about everything, never uptight, never with this, you know the stand that he does with his hands across his chest where he looks like he\u0027s holding everything in, being tough? He never stands like that in New York. And so he was just back to his normal self. And then we\u0027d come back to Indiana and he\u0027d go back into this person again, like he was this black man living in this white world kind of thing, that he wasn\u0027t himself.","Your dad never took me to a black function. Everything we did was in my world. So I don\u0027t think that was fair. I didn\u0027t marry into that.","When I was dating him, the thing I liked about him was that I was living in another culture environment. You have to understand, I\u0027m a foreign language major. I like cultures. It\u0027s important to me. So he kind of deprived me, or our marriage I think, of that cultural experience because he didn\u0027t contribute to it.","Would I agree with that? No. Not at all. No, I really don\u0027t think that it had anything to do with race. I think it had to do with other things. I always thought that our marriage was like anybody else\u0027s marriage. You talk about the same things. You talk about money or your kids or what you\u0027re going to do on the weekend or whatever. The color of skin was the only thing that was different. But the falling apart had nothing to do with that, I don\u0027t think. At least not from my point of view. It may have from your dad\u0027s. But it didn\u0027t for me at all.","Well, that\u0027s probably true. I\u0027m not going to be upset if you marry a black girl, for sure.

And I would be the only person left in the dorm waiting for this black party to start! Me and the black girls left in the dorm. All the white girls are gone already.","\"Tonight is the night, as I guess Janey has told you. We talked to Pastor Stefan Tuesday evening and decided to arrange things for this weekend since the next two weeks are going to be full of study for final exams and moving, we hope. I\u0027m going to wear that pale blue cocktail dress, size 11, it fits me again, and a white mantilla and black patent shoes.","Well, that\u0027s probably true. I\u0027m not going to be upset if you marry a black girl, for sure. I don\u0027t care one way or the other, as long as you\u0027re happy. These are issues like religion. Everybody has their own personal feeling about it, and you don\u0027t have to agree.","\"Say hi--\" I\u0027m telling you, Rich! You don\u0027t understand. I was so small-towny.","I don\u0027t know. Do you feel uncomfortable in both worlds in a way?","But I didn\u0027t have to change anything about the way I already was. Church. He went to church with me every Sunday. He fit right in. When he was in his fraternity, him and his group of fraternity friends, he was very outgoing, funny, loud-- like you are. People laughed when he made jokes. And he could sing really good. And a lot of the fraternity functions, they would have what they called a line. And he was in this little quartet with Arthur-somebody from New York. And John Brooks was in the quartet and somebody else. And they did all these little Temptation numbers where they would dance together.","Well, I used to go watch him practice track a lot, which was over here. You want to go over there? Because that was--","And that was my first experience of really mixing with the black kids, because Clara and I would go to lunch together, or meals together. And I would sit at a table with black kids. And so that was really kind of how it happened.","And so most of the time when I was with him, he was fun to be around. But what was lacking, I guess, the jump between that and getting married was that we never had any conversation. I didn\u0027t know him at all. Other than the fact that we had sex together all the time, it wasn\u0027t like you\u0027d sit down and have long conversations getting to know each other. Because he doesn\u0027t talk. You can\u0027t get to know somebody who doesn\u0027t talk.","When I was dating him, the thing I liked about him was that I was living in another culture environment. You have to understand, I\u0027m a foreign language major. I like cultures. It\u0027s important to me. So he kind of deprived me, or our marriage I think, of that cultural experience because he didn\u0027t contribute to it.","If you are open I think they can. When people get married to each other, they\u0027re supposed to be intimate with all of their thoughts. And if you are, then you can understand another person. I don\u0027t think the race gets in the way of that.","I had to tell you. I\u0027ve never kept any secrets from you and this wasn\u0027t going to be one. I hope you\u0027re not angry. Even you would like him. No one minded. Bill Crowell was there and real nice to both of us. I don\u0027t know why there has to be a racial problem anyway. I had so much better time with him than I do with Bob or David [? Kiechle ?] or Bill Crowell or Roger Heckerman and he treated me like a queen. Sad, isn\u0027t it? Please don\u0027t think I\u0027m being a rebel. I love you both very much and am proud to be close enough to my parents to tell them everything, whether or not I know they will disagree with me. I\u0027m sure it makes us all better people. I love you, OK? Love, Julia.","And then I started going to functions with Clara. Clara would go to the black fraternity and sorority parties and I would go. I don\u0027t know if I would have done that before I went to Europe. I think going to Europe had something to do with it just because it broadened my way of thinking, perhaps. If I hadn\u0027t gone to Europe and been assigned a black roommate, I don\u0027t think it would have happened.","I used to think then, I used to think it was very sad. I remember feeling this way. The few times that we went back to New York, he would flip into a whole alter person, second person-- like a schizophrenic personality, a totally different person. We\u0027d go to New York. He\u0027d be hanging out with Poke, laughing. His brother, laughing. His sister, laughing. Drinking a lot, partying, just like I remembered him in college before we got married.","You know the other thing that was just kind of hard for me to get used to was that their parties never started until 10:00 at night. At least 10:00, maybe later. And we had dorm curfews then. And I was still a pretty good girl. I didn\u0027t stay out all night. So I had to stay out all night with him because I couldn\u0027t get back into the dorm. And that was an annoyance to me. I always thought, why can\u0027t they start the parties like normal white people do?","Daddy, I\u0027m sending you my tax statement. Would you rather I fill out the forms? I\u0027m taking Personal Finance next semester which will teach me all about insurance and taxes and things like that. Have you told Grandma and Grandpa yet or Janine and Buddy? Is it all right if I write to the aunts and uncles? Whatever you want me to do is OK, but I\u0027d rather tell everyone now. That\u0027s all for now, I guess. I\u0027m so sorry that this is so hard for you to understand and accept. I know it will be an uphill road from now on, but we could do it. Much love, Jul.\"","\"Robby is so excited about going back. All his friends are there and I don\u0027t think he ever wants to live anywhere else. I want to have a house in the country, but--\" God, I can\u0027t believe I thought I was getting a house in the country near New York!","Well, that\u0027s one of those human dilemmas. You just have to work on it for the rest of your life.","Oh, this was written the night of our wedding.","That\u0027s right! It would be the same--","No. Obviously not.","\"October 30, 1966. Hello, home. Well, I went to have the tire patched--\"","Maybe you\u0027re more conscious of it because you\u0027re neither.","It was like all of a sudden, we\u0027re back in this fraternity party mode again, real easy about everything, never uptight, never with this, you know the stand that he does with his hands across his chest where he looks like he\u0027s holding everything in, being tough? He never stands like that in New York. And so he was just back to his normal self. And then we\u0027d come back to Indiana and he\u0027d go back into this person again, like he was this black man living in this white world kind of thing, that he wasn\u0027t himself.","And after I was married to him, it didn\u0027t take me very long to realize that it was going to be a fairly successful marriage because his value system was very close to mine. He\u0027s very family oriented. He came from a middle-class upbringing which valued education. And so I didn\u0027t think it was very difficult to be married to him, even though I hadn\u0027t planned to, because the things that I wanted out of a marriage, he wanted too. And just little simple things, like going to the grocery store and being able to pick out food that I knew he was going to eat. I didn\u0027t have to cook chitlins, which-- I guess it was easier than I expected. That\u0027s a stupid example.","\"I went to a good play last night, Misalliance by George Bernard Shaw. A friend of mine was in it, but he wasn\u0027t any good. I went with Richard Robinson.\" Oh! \"A track runner, singer, dancer, all-around good looker, religious, and liked by everyone. He\u0027s one of the nicest people I know. And he\u0027s Negro.","[LAUGHTER]","Your dad never took me to a black function. Everything we did was in my world. So I don\u0027t think that was fair. I didn\u0027t marry into that.","Would I agree with that? No. Not at all. No, I really don\u0027t think that it had anything to do with race. I think it had to do with other things. I always thought that our marriage was like anybody else\u0027s marriage. You talk about the same things. You talk about money or your kids or what you\u0027re going to do on the weekend or whatever. The color of skin was the only thing that was different. But the falling apart had nothing to do with that, I don\u0027t think. At least not from my point of view. It may have from your dad\u0027s. But it didn\u0027t for me at all.","I remember exactly how this happened. We were standing in line at the cafeteria, and Richard was so many people in front of us around the corner, like we could see him maybe 30 feet away. And I said, \"Clare, I want you to introduce me to him. He is gorgeous.\" And he has something about his legs. Because he used to wear these faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove. And his muscles were so defined from track that his leg muscles would just bulge through these-- [GIGGLES]. And I wanted to meet him because of his legs. This is terrible. It was totally lust.","I remember very clearly believing that it was going to be a different world, and that-- you know, John F. Kennedy and then Martin Luther King-- that the world was going to change and that we wouldn\u0027t live in a racially divided country anymore. And so I had no doubt at that time that my kids would live in a totally different environment than I had grown up in, that there wouldn\u0027t be any racial prejudice when you guys were growing up."]},"Announcer":{"name":"Announcer","episodes":{"105":"Take A Negro Home"},"statements":["PRI.

OK.","When a person says that they want to be successful, they have to realize that there will be opposition. And despite what opposition says, when someone says you can\u0027t, I had this defiant side of myself. When I said, oh, I can\u0027t? No, I think I can.","It is.","And my mother, we come from welfare. She\u0027s on welfare. She had dropped out of high school and gotten pregnant at an early age. And she got a GED. She wasn\u0027t college educated. So sometimes I was ashamed of the fact that my mother wasn\u0027t on the same level as the other parents.","So bad.","Yeah.","This is really difficult for me to talk about. So you\u0027ve got to bear with me here. Plus I haven\u0027t given this much thought. Success is a trip. Because we push people, especially blacks, to be successful, minorities to be successful. And then once they get there, and once we get there, for some reason, we pull each other back.","No. Now, no.","Sometimes. Sometimes.","Oh, it\u0027s finished.","I\u0027ve never drank.","I do. Because I\u0027ve grown more comfortable with Brown.","No. Because I\u0027ve been ashamed to admit that to her. For a long time, I had been in denial about that.

But that\u0027s today, when everything is already messed up. Let\u0027s go back to a simpler time, before it all began.","Both my parents went to Indiana University in the \u002760s. That\u0027s where they met. Mom had been valedictorian. She was in college on scholarship. She was going to be a foreign language major, and when she graduated, she was going to be a translator for the UN. Part of the plan was to go to Europe for a semester. When she came back, her roommate had been assigned to someone else, and she had gotten a new roommate, a black girl named Clara.","My mom and I drove around the Indiana University campus. She showed me where she and my dad met, where they lived, and where they went to parties and dances at my dad\u0027s black fraternity, Omega Psi Phi.","My mom was so white to me at that moment. Growing up, I just thought of her as my mother. But as she told me this, she seemed like the whitest white person in the world. I asked my mom how she met my father. She said they met in a cafeteria. She said Clara and her were getting lunch.","What attracted you to Mom?","That\u0027s about as far as my father goes when he talks about dating my mom. He doesn\u0027t talk about her. He talks about the openness of the \u002760s and the attitude of the era, as if the \u002760s had been dating my mom instead of him. My mom also recalls being caught up in the times.","Neither of my parents was an activist. They weren\u0027t trying to change the world. But clearly half the fun of finding each other was the thrill of mixing with someone of the other race. After a year of dating, my mom got pregnant and they decided to get married. The ceremony was small. Both my parents\u0027 families disapproved of the marriage. In fact, my father\u0027s sister Bernice remembers my white grandmother call my black grandmother on the phone before the wedding to propose that they form an interracial coalition to stop the marriage. Neither grandmother admits to remembering this, but neither came to the wedding either.","Bernice and Grandma said they were both surprised when he said he was getting married. And one of the reasons was, \"Cause he don\u0027t talk!\"","This is the thing about my father, he doesn\u0027t talk. Everyone in the family knows this. It\u0027s an established fact, an elemental property of my dad. My grandmother says he learned this from her.","With who?","Oh, yeah?","The long-term plan after graduation was to move to Brooklyn, back to my dad\u0027s hometown. My mother wrote home about it.","That\u0027s awesome.","Had you been to New York?","It turns out my dad romanticized some things too. Brooklyn had changed a lot since he grew up. Now there were bums in the park, abandoned stores, and riot gates. At the school where my dad worked, the kids were breaking windows and starting fires and attacking teachers. My dad hated that there was nowhere he felt safe letting us kids run around. And my mom hated sharing a kitchen with the cockroaches.","Their apartment was right next to the El, so it was loud and everything-- furniture, clothes, kids-- was always covered in a fine layer of soot. And they were real poor. My father\u0027s substitute teaching job barely paid the rent. In Indiana, my parents had fun together. It wasn\u0027t like that in New York. Everything was all about working and struggling to survive. Finally, someone threw a brick through their window, breaking glass all over the living room where my sister and I had been playing only a few minutes earlier.","Within a week, my parents packed up a U-Haul and drove straight back to Indiana. They lived in Brooklyn only six months.","If there\u0027s a tragedy in this story, it begins here. As hard as things were in Brooklyn, I think my parents\u0027 marriage could have made it there, with my dad living in a world he was used to, surrounded by friends and family, and my mother happily exploring a different world. But Indianapolis ate away at my father. At first, it was just like he wanted. The streets were wide, clean, and empty, with trees on both sides and grass that was always greener. A canal meanders through the city.","Indianapolis was the opposite of Brooklyn. It made parenting easy and fun. We flew kites in the summer and built snow forts in the winter. I found an old reel-to-reel tape of my father, my sister, and me in those early days.","We spent Christmas that first year at my grandparents\u0027 80-acre farm with my mother\u0027s family. Dad saw how beautiful it was there, how perfect for us kids to run around and explore. We went back for Easter and then Thanksgiving and Christmas again and every year for the next eight years. We practically had forgot about my dad\u0027s family in Brooklyn. That\u0027s how my dad\u0027s sister, Bernice, remembers it.","In this new world, no one was black except my father. He never saw his family, he didn\u0027t make any friends, he didn\u0027t keep in touch with his old college friends. I asked my dad who he hung out with in Indiana when my parents were married.","Huh. Who hung out with your friends?","My father became someone else in Indiana, a completely different person. And this new face he put on is the face that I recognize and that I picture when I think about him. I can\u0027t imagine my father dancing and drinking or laughing with a posse of black friends. My father is someone who never took a sick day from work, who was always home and always responsible. He is a withdrawn and lonely father of three in a white city.","So how did you survive?","I stood face to face in a doorway with my father talking about this for an hour. Neither of us moved. Neither of us sat down. And as we unearthed this, I felt sorry for him and I understood why he had become who he was. It wasn\u0027t exactly that race destroyed their marriage, but it added to his isolation and subtracted from his person. And that, in the end, destroyed what they had together.","Before I started doing this story, I never talked to my parents about how their marriage failed or what their divorce was supposed to mean for me, expressly about who I choose to marry or not marry. Getting my dad to sit down for one last round of questions about this wasn\u0027t easy.","You have to talk to me. Do you know what my story is, Dad?","Well, let me ask you if you know what my-- do you know what I\u0027m doing a story on? I\u0027m doing a story on my parents. You and Mom. I\u0027m trying to use-- I mean, I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m using you as an example in my life, but I\u0027m trying to get a message from you on what I should do, because you never, I don\u0027t know. You never say anything. So I\u0027m just trying to figure it out.","And here\u0027s what I see. You got married to a white woman, in whatever, \u002767.

And she\u0027s over there in an all-white world. I mean, is that a lesson?","Well, what about if you\u0027re old?","So you don\u0027t think it\u0027s a mistake at all.","This is not the answer I expected from him. He thinks intermarriage can work so long as you\u0027re not isolated from your own race the way he was in Indiana. It\u0027s not the answer I wanted.","You know what my-- I have this Asian friend. Girlfriend. Well, friend-girl. You know what she said to me about mixed marriages? She said, you can never marry a white girl because she\u0027ll never understand.","His answer is sort of ambiguous, but the way I take this, and the way I want to take this, is that he agrees with me, that a white woman will never understand.","Did Mom ever understand?","Again, his answer is blurry, but that\u0027s just the way he talks. I\u0027m pretty sure what he\u0027s saying is that she didn\u0027t understand. My mom disagrees completely. When I call her up to talk about this, I tell her that the lesson I take from their divorce is that interracial marriage doesn\u0027t work.","Well, since college, I kind of changed my opinion. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ever going to-- I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to marry white. And one of my friends was telling me, and she kind of gave me the good reason in my head, she said, \"You can never marry a white woman because she\u0027ll never understand.\"","I ask my mom what I asked my dad, if she thinks a white woman can understand a black man, specifically me.","Well, why do you think it makes a difference to me then?","It\u0027s not true.","Yeah. And I don\u0027t really want to lose either part.","Here\u0027s what I figured out doing this story. I still can\u0027t imagine marrying a white woman, but not because I believe race destroyed my parents\u0027 marriage. I don\u0027t really believe that anymore. but because I realize I\u0027m used to crossing between two worlds, and I want someone who can do that with me. And for better or worse, right or wrong, I just can\u0027t imagine having a blond-haired, blue-eyed girlfriend standing next to me at the Black Poets Society.","As for my parents, my mom says she barely knows any black people anymore.

At the last minute, we were able to get Mayor Daley as speaker. He presented a very interesting talk. The highlight of it was a discussion of the forthcoming campaign \u0027Take a Negro Boy Home Tonight,\u0027 which all agreed was a fine step forward in human relations. It is to be inaugurated soon in the city\u0027s high schools.","Mayor Daley told us that he had been advised by an outstanding sociologist that the vicious hates and fears rooted in racial prejudice and fascist bigotry could best be combated by closer and more intimate relationships between Negro boys and white girls. Therefore this new campaign will encourage white high school girls to volunteer to take Negro boys to their homes for dinner and date them afterwards. These girls will get higher marks and other privileges for promoting interracial harmony. This will show the white parents that it\u0027s all right to have these associations.","Now we must all do our part.

It is happening in Chicago. It will be tried in Mississippi if the NAACP ever gets a foot in the door.\"","Well, you know, the most interesting thing about this campaign, \"Take a Negro Boy Home Tonight,\" is that it is complete fiction.

Well, I went to have the tire patched--\"","\"I went to a good play last night, Misalliance by George Bernard Shaw. A friend of mine was in it, but he wasn\u0027t any good. I went with Richard Robinson.\" Oh! \"A track runner, singer, dancer, all-around good looker, religious, and liked by everyone. He\u0027s one of the nicest people I know. And he\u0027s Negro.","I had to tell you. I\u0027ve never kept any secrets from you and this wasn\u0027t going to be one. I hope you\u0027re not angry. Even you would like him. No one minded. Bill Crowell was there and real nice to both of us. I don\u0027t know why there has to be a racial problem anyway. I had so much better time with him than I do with Bob or David [? Kiechle ?] or Bill Crowell or Roger Heckerman and he treated me like a queen. Sad, isn\u0027t it? Please don\u0027t think I\u0027m being a rebel. I love you both very much and am proud to be close enough to my parents to tell them everything, whether or not I know they will disagree with me. I\u0027m sure it makes us all better people. I love you, OK? Love, Julia.","And that was my first experience of really mixing with the black kids, because Clara and I would go to lunch together, or meals together. And I would sit at a table with black kids. And so that was really kind of how it happened.","And then I started going to functions with Clara. Clara would go to the black fraternity and sorority parties and I would go. I don\u0027t know if I would have done that before I went to Europe. I think going to Europe had something to do with it just because it broadened my way of thinking, perhaps. If I hadn\u0027t gone to Europe and been assigned a black roommate, I don\u0027t think it would have happened.","Well, I used to go watch him practice track a lot, which was over here. You want to go over there? Because that was--","You know the other thing that was just kind of hard for me to get used to was that their parties never started until 10:00 at night. At least 10:00, maybe later. And we had dorm curfews then. And I was still a pretty good girl. I didn\u0027t stay out all night. So I had to stay out all night with him because I couldn\u0027t get back into the dorm. And that was an annoyance to me. I always thought, why can\u0027t they start the parties like normal white people do?","[LAUGHTER]","And this is the other thing. Everybody else would be gone on their dates already. And I would be the only person left in the dorm waiting for this black party to start! Me and the black girls left in the dorm. All the white girls are gone already.","I remember exactly how this happened. We were standing in line at the cafeteria, and Richard was so many people in front of us around the corner, like we could see him maybe 30 feet away. And I said, \"Clare, I want you to introduce me to him. He is gorgeous.\" And he has something about his legs. Because he used to wear these faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove. And his muscles were so defined from track that his leg muscles would just bulge through these-- [GIGGLES]. And I wanted to meet him because of his legs. This is terrible. It was totally lust.","I remember very clearly believing that it was going to be a different world, and that-- you know, John F. Kennedy and then Martin Luther King-- that the world was going to change and that we wouldn\u0027t live in a racially divided country anymore. And so I had no doubt at that time that my kids would live in a totally different environment than I had grown up in, that there wouldn\u0027t be any racial prejudice when you guys were growing up.","Oh, this was written the night of our wedding.","\"Tonight is the night, as I guess Janey has told you. We talked to Pastor Stefan Tuesday evening and decided to arrange things for this weekend since the next two weeks are going to be full of study for final exams and moving, we hope. I\u0027m going to wear that pale blue cocktail dress, size 11, it fits me again, and a white mantilla and black patent shoes.","Daddy, I\u0027m sending you my tax statement. Would you rather I fill out the forms? I\u0027m taking Personal Finance next semester which will teach me all about insurance and taxes and things like that. Have you told Grandma and Grandpa yet or Janine and Buddy? Is it all right if I write to the aunts and uncles? Whatever you want me to do is OK, but I\u0027d rather tell everyone now. That\u0027s all for now, I guess. I\u0027m so sorry that this is so hard for you to understand and accept. I know it will be an uphill road from now on, but we could do it. Much love, Jul.\"","And after I was married to him, it didn\u0027t take me very long to realize that it was going to be a fairly successful marriage because his value system was very close to mine. He\u0027s very family oriented. He came from a middle-class upbringing which valued education. And so I didn\u0027t think it was very difficult to be married to him, even though I hadn\u0027t planned to, because the things that I wanted out of a marriage, he wanted too. And just little simple things, like going to the grocery store and being able to pick out food that I knew he was going to eat. I didn\u0027t have to cook chitlins, which-- I guess it was easier than I expected. That\u0027s a stupid example.","But I didn\u0027t have to change anything about the way I already was. Church. He went to church with me every Sunday. He fit right in. When he was in his fraternity, him and his group of fraternity friends, he was very outgoing, funny, loud-- like you are. People laughed when he made jokes. And he could sing really good. And a lot of the fraternity functions, they would have what they called a line. And he was in this little quartet with Arthur-somebody from New York. And John Brooks was in the quartet and somebody else. And they did all these little Temptation numbers where they would dance together.","And so most of the time when I was with him, he was fun to be around. But what was lacking, I guess, the jump between that and getting married was that we never had any conversation. I didn\u0027t know him at all. Other than the fact that we had sex together all the time, it wasn\u0027t like you\u0027d sit down and have long conversations getting to know each other. Because he doesn\u0027t talk. You can\u0027t get to know somebody who doesn\u0027t talk.","That\u0027s right! It would be the same--","\"Robby is so excited about going back. All his friends are there and I don\u0027t think he ever wants to live anywhere else. I want to have a house in the country, but--\" God, I can\u0027t believe I thought I was getting a house in the country near New York!","[LAUGHTER]","Jesus!","\"Say hi--\" I\u0027m telling you, Rich! You don\u0027t understand. I was so small-towny.","No. Obviously not.","I used to think then, I used to think it was very sad. I remember feeling this way. The few times that we went back to New York, he would flip into a whole alter person, second person-- like a schizophrenic personality, a totally different person. We\u0027d go to New York. He\u0027d be hanging out with Poke, laughing. His brother, laughing. His sister, laughing. Drinking a lot, partying, just like I remembered him in college before we got married.","It was like all of a sudden, we\u0027re back in this fraternity party mode again, real easy about everything, never uptight, never with this, you know the stand that he does with his hands across his chest where he looks like he\u0027s holding everything in, being tough? He never stands like that in New York. And so he was just back to his normal self. And then we\u0027d come back to Indiana and he\u0027d go back into this person again, like he was this black man living in this white world kind of thing, that he wasn\u0027t himself.","Your dad never took me to a black function. Everything we did was in my world. So I don\u0027t think that was fair. I didn\u0027t marry into that.","When I was dating him, the thing I liked about him was that I was living in another culture environment. You have to understand, I\u0027m a foreign language major. I like cultures. It\u0027s important to me. So he kind of deprived me, or our marriage I think, of that cultural experience because he didn\u0027t contribute to it.","Would I agree with that? No. Not at all. No, I really don\u0027t think that it had anything to do with race. I think it had to do with other things. I always thought that our marriage was like anybody else\u0027s marriage. You talk about the same things. You talk about money or your kids or what you\u0027re going to do on the weekend or whatever. The color of skin was the only thing that was different. But the falling apart had nothing to do with that, I don\u0027t think. At least not from my point of view. It may have from your dad\u0027s. But it didn\u0027t for me at all.","Well, that\u0027s probably true. I\u0027m not going to be upset if you marry a black girl, for sure. I don\u0027t care one way or the other, as long as you\u0027re happy. These are issues like religion. Everybody has their own personal feeling about it, and you don\u0027t have to agree.","If you are open I think they can. When people get married to each other, they\u0027re supposed to be intimate with all of their thoughts. And if you are, then you can understand another person. I don\u0027t think the race gets in the way of that.","Maybe you\u0027re more conscious of it because you\u0027re neither.","I don\u0027t know. Do you feel uncomfortable in both worlds in a way?","Well, that\u0027s one of those human dilemmas. You just have to work on it for the rest of your life."],"spokenWords":["Jesus!","And this is the other thing. Everybody else would be gone on their dates already.

But that\u0027s today, when everything is already messed up. Let\u0027s go back to a simpler time, before it all began."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Both my parents went to Indiana University in the \u002760s. That\u0027s where they met. Mom had been valedictorian. She was in college on scholarship. She was going to be a foreign language major, and when she graduated, she was going to be a translator for the UN. Part of the plan was to go to Europe for a semester. When she came back, her roommate had been assigned to someone else, and she had gotten a new roommate, a black girl named Clara."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And that was my first experience of really mixing with the black kids, because Clara and I would go to lunch together, or meals together. And I would sit at a table with black kids. And so that was really kind of how it happened."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And then I started going to functions with Clara. Clara would go to the black fraternity and sorority parties and I would go. I don\u0027t know if I would have done that before I went to Europe. I think going to Europe had something to do with it just because it broadened my way of thinking, perhaps. If I hadn\u0027t gone to Europe and been assigned a black roommate, I don\u0027t think it would have happened."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Well, I used to go watch him practice track a lot, which was over here. You want to go over there? Because that was--"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"My mom and I drove around the Indiana University campus. She showed me where she and my dad met, where they lived, and where they went to parties and dances at my dad\u0027s black fraternity, Omega Psi Phi."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"You know the other thing that was just kind of hard for me to get used to was that their parties never started until 10:00 at night. At least 10:00, maybe later. And we had dorm curfews then. And I was still a pretty good girl. I didn\u0027t stay out all night. So I had to stay out all night with him because I couldn\u0027t get back into the dorm. And that was an annoyance to me. I always thought, why can\u0027t they start the parties like normal white people do?"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"[LAUGHTER]"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And this is the other thing. Everybody else would be gone on their dates already. And I would be the only person left in the dorm waiting for this black party to start! Me and the black girls left in the dorm. All the white girls are gone already."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"My mom was so white to me at that moment. Growing up, I just thought of her as my mother. But as she told me this, she seemed like the whitest white person in the world. I asked my mom how she met my father. She said they met in a cafeteria. She said Clara and her were getting lunch."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I remember exactly how this happened. We were standing in line at the cafeteria, and Richard was so many people in front of us around the corner, like we could see him maybe 30 feet away. And I said, \"Clare, I want you to introduce me to him. He is gorgeous.\" And he has something about his legs. Because he used to wear these faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove. And his muscles were so defined from track that his leg muscles would just bulge through these-- [GIGGLES]. And I wanted to meet him because of his legs. This is terrible. It was totally lust."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"What attracted you to Mom?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I think it was the times that we were going through, in terms of Martin Luther King era, in regard to looking toward being open to any race and thinking things were going to change. And then everybody was going to be accepted as anyone else."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"That\u0027s about as far as my father goes when he talks about dating my mom. He doesn\u0027t talk about her. He talks about the openness of the \u002760s and the attitude of the era, as if the \u002760s had been dating my mom instead of him. My mom also recalls being caught up in the times."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I remember very clearly believing that it was going to be a different world, and that-- you know, John F. Kennedy and then Martin Luther King-- that the world was going to change and that we wouldn\u0027t live in a racially divided country anymore. And so I had no doubt at that time that my kids would live in a totally different environment than I had grown up in, that there wouldn\u0027t be any racial prejudice when you guys were growing up."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Neither of my parents was an activist. They weren\u0027t trying to change the world. But clearly half the fun of finding each other was the thrill of mixing with someone of the other race. After a year of dating, my mom got pregnant and they decided to get married. The ceremony was small. Both my parents\u0027 families disapproved of the marriage. In fact, my father\u0027s sister Bernice remembers my white grandmother call my black grandmother on the phone before the wedding to propose that they form an interracial coalition to stop the marriage. Neither grandmother admits to remembering this, but neither came to the wedding either."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Oh, this was written the night of our wedding."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"Tonight is the night, as I guess Janey has told you. We talked to Pastor Stefan Tuesday evening and decided to arrange things for this weekend since the next two weeks are going to be full of study for final exams and moving, we hope. I\u0027m going to wear that pale blue cocktail dress, size 11, it fits me again, and a white mantilla and black patent shoes."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Daddy, I\u0027m sending you my tax statement. Would you rather I fill out the forms? I\u0027m taking Personal Finance next semester which will teach me all about insurance and taxes and things like that. Have you told Grandma and Grandpa yet or Janine and Buddy? Is it all right if I write to the aunts and uncles? Whatever you want me to do is OK, but I\u0027d rather tell everyone now. That\u0027s all for now, I guess. I\u0027m so sorry that this is so hard for you to understand and accept. I know it will be an uphill road from now on, but we could do it. Much love, Jul.\""},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And after I was married to him, it didn\u0027t take me very long to realize that it was going to be a fairly successful marriage because his value system was very close to mine. He\u0027s very family oriented. He came from a middle-class upbringing which valued education. And so I didn\u0027t think it was very difficult to be married to him, even though I hadn\u0027t planned to, because the things that I wanted out of a marriage, he wanted too. And just little simple things, like going to the grocery store and being able to pick out food that I knew he was going to eat. I didn\u0027t have to cook chitlins, which-- I guess it was easier than I expected. That\u0027s a stupid example."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"But I didn\u0027t have to change anything about the way I already was. Church. He went to church with me every Sunday. He fit right in. When he was in his fraternity, him and his group of fraternity friends, he was very outgoing, funny, loud-- like you are. People laughed when he made jokes. And he could sing really good. And a lot of the fraternity functions, they would have what they called a line. And he was in this little quartet with Arthur-somebody from New York. And John Brooks was in the quartet and somebody else. And they did all these little Temptation numbers where they would dance together."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And so most of the time when I was with him, he was fun to be around. But what was lacking, I guess, the jump between that and getting married was that we never had any conversation. I didn\u0027t know him at all. Other than the fact that we had sex together all the time, it wasn\u0027t like you\u0027d sit down and have long conversations getting to know each other. Because he doesn\u0027t talk. You can\u0027t get to know somebody who doesn\u0027t talk."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Bernice and Grandma said they were both surprised when he said he was getting married. And one of the reasons was, \"Cause he don\u0027t talk!\""},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"That\u0027s right! It would be the same--"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"This is the thing about my father, he doesn\u0027t talk. Everyone in the family knows this. It\u0027s an established fact, an elemental property of my dad. My grandmother says he learned this from her."},{"speakerName":"Grandma Robinson","text":"That\u0027s the best way. Don\u0027t you think? When you talk so much, you get in trouble."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"With who?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma Robinson","text":"Those think it best you don\u0027t talk so much."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Oh, yeah?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma Robinson","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"The long-term plan after graduation was to move to Brooklyn, back to my dad\u0027s hometown. My mother wrote home about it."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"Robby is so excited about going back. All his friends are there and I don\u0027t think he ever wants to live anywhere else. I want to have a house in the country, but--\" God, I can\u0027t believe I thought I was getting a house in the country near New York!"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"[LAUGHTER]"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Jesus!"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"That\u0027s awesome."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"Say hi--\" I\u0027m telling you, Rich! You don\u0027t understand. I was so small-towny."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Had you been to New York?"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"No. Obviously not."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"It turns out my dad romanticized some things too. Brooklyn had changed a lot since he grew up. Now there were bums in the park, abandoned stores, and riot gates. At the school where my dad worked, the kids were breaking windows and starting fires and attacking teachers. My dad hated that there was nowhere he felt safe letting us kids run around. And my mom hated sharing a kitchen with the cockroaches."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Their apartment was right next to the El, so it was loud and everything-- furniture, clothes, kids-- was always covered in a fine layer of soot. And they were real poor. My father\u0027s substitute teaching job barely paid the rent. In Indiana, my parents had fun together. It wasn\u0027t like that in New York. Everything was all about working and struggling to survive. Finally, someone threw a brick through their window, breaking glass all over the living room where my sister and I had been playing only a few minutes earlier."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Within a week, my parents packed up a U-Haul and drove straight back to Indiana. They lived in Brooklyn only six months."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"If there\u0027s a tragedy in this story, it begins here. As hard as things were in Brooklyn, I think my parents\u0027 marriage could have made it there, with my dad living in a world he was used to, surrounded by friends and family, and my mother happily exploring a different world. But Indianapolis ate away at my father. At first, it was just like he wanted. The streets were wide, clean, and empty, with trees on both sides and grass that was always greener. A canal meanders through the city."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Indianapolis was the opposite of Brooklyn. It made parenting easy and fun. We flew kites in the summer and built snow forts in the winter. I found an old reel-to-reel tape of my father, my sister, and me in those early days."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"What did we make yesterday?"},{"speakerName":"Young Rich Robinson","text":"Snowman."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Which one? A Mama or a Daddy snowman?"},{"speakerName":"Young Rich Robinson","text":"Today, we made a snowman [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Today, I\u0027ll go make a Daddy snowman."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"That\u0027s great. We\u0027ll make a Daddy snowman today."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"[BABY NOISES]"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"We spent Christmas that first year at my grandparents\u0027 80-acre farm with my mother\u0027s family. Dad saw how beautiful it was there, how perfect for us kids to run around and explore. We went back for Easter and then Thanksgiving and Christmas again and every year for the next eight years. We practically had forgot about my dad\u0027s family in Brooklyn. That\u0027s how my dad\u0027s sister, Bernice, remembers it."},{"speakerName":"Bernice","text":"And we didn\u0027t see Richard again for about 10 years. The only thing we knew is-- we called every now and then. And we knew that he had moved into a trailer and he had bought a house and then he sold that house and he was somewhere else. We just kind of casually kept in contact with him. And that was it. We\u0027d get a Christmas card. And maybe once a year, we\u0027d get a phone call. That was it. He was completely detached from the family."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"In this new world, no one was black except my father. He never saw his family, he didn\u0027t make any friends, he didn\u0027t keep in touch with his old college friends. I asked my dad who he hung out with in Indiana when my parents were married."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I don\u0027t know whether you\u0027d say hang out. There was occasions that you\u0027d go to in terms of gatherings, but I didn\u0027t hang out with anyone."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Huh. Who hung out with your friends?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I had things to do. I was pretty much on my own or pretty much an entity within myself. It was just mainly children, my children. It wasn\u0027t many friends at all."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I used to think then, I used to think it was very sad. I remember feeling this way. The few times that we went back to New York, he would flip into a whole alter person, second person-- like a schizophrenic personality, a totally different person. We\u0027d go to New York. He\u0027d be hanging out with Poke, laughing. His brother, laughing. His sister, laughing. Drinking a lot, partying, just like I remembered him in college before we got married."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"It was like all of a sudden, we\u0027re back in this fraternity party mode again, real easy about everything, never uptight, never with this, you know the stand that he does with his hands across his chest where he looks like he\u0027s holding everything in, being tough? He never stands like that in New York. And so he was just back to his normal self. And then we\u0027d come back to Indiana and he\u0027d go back into this person again, like he was this black man living in this white world kind of thing, that he wasn\u0027t himself."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Your dad never took me to a black function. Everything we did was in my world. So I don\u0027t think that was fair. I didn\u0027t marry into that."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"When I was dating him, the thing I liked about him was that I was living in another culture environment. You have to understand, I\u0027m a foreign language major. I like cultures. It\u0027s important to me. So he kind of deprived me, or our marriage I think, of that cultural experience because he didn\u0027t contribute to it."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"My father became someone else in Indiana, a completely different person. And this new face he put on is the face that I recognize and that I picture when I think about him. I can\u0027t imagine my father dancing and drinking or laughing with a posse of black friends. My father is someone who never took a sick day from work, who was always home and always responsible. He is a withdrawn and lonely father of three in a white city."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"No, it didn\u0027t pan out that well for myself. No, I didn\u0027t have much of anything. I just kind of walked away from all I knew and everything that was a part of me. If there was a personality change, it might have been as a result of that."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"So how did you survive?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Well, I didn\u0027t think about. I just worked and raised the children. At the time, that was what was important."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"I stood face to face in a doorway with my father talking about this for an hour. Neither of us moved. Neither of us sat down. And as we unearthed this, I felt sorry for him and I understood why he had become who he was. It wasn\u0027t exactly that race destroyed their marriage, but it added to his isolation and subtracted from his person. And that, in the end, destroyed what they had together."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Before I started doing this story, I never talked to my parents about how their marriage failed or what their divorce was supposed to mean for me, expressly about who I choose to marry or not marry.

You never say anything. So I\u0027m just trying to figure it out."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"And here\u0027s what I see. You got married to a white woman, in whatever, \u002767.

And where you live is still kind of important, in terms of the state. If a person were in New York or perhaps even California-- and there\u0027s probably other places that I don\u0027t know about, then it doesn\u0027t really matter what."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"This is not the answer I expected from him. He thinks intermarriage can work so long as you\u0027re not isolated from your own race the way he was in Indiana. It\u0027s not the answer I wanted."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"You know what my-- I have this Asian friend. Girlfriend. Well, friend-girl.

I\u0027m pretty sure what he\u0027s saying is that she didn\u0027t understand. My mom disagrees completely.

No. Not at all. No, I really don\u0027t think that it had anything to do with race. I think it had to do with other things. I always thought that our marriage was like anybody else\u0027s marriage. You talk about the same things. You talk about money or your kids or what you\u0027re going to do on the weekend or whatever. The color of skin was the only thing that was different. But the falling apart had nothing to do with that, I don\u0027t think. At least not from my point of view. It may have from your dad\u0027s.

I\u0027m not going to be upset if you marry a black girl, for sure. I don\u0027t care one way or the other, as long as you\u0027re happy. These are issues like religion. Everybody has their own personal feeling about it, and you don\u0027t have to agree."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"I ask my mom what I asked my dad, if she thinks a white woman can understand a black man, specifically me."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"If you are open I think they can.

I still can\u0027t imagine marrying a white woman, but not because I believe race destroyed my parents\u0027 marriage. I don\u0027t really believe that anymore. but because I realize I\u0027m used to crossing between two worlds, and I want someone who can do that with me.

I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Bring a Negro Boy Home Tonight. And if that seems like a strange title, then you\u0027re just going to have to start listening to these shows from the beginning. The show is stories of people defying some of the oldest codes of behavior in our country by mixing races. Act One of our show was about intermarriage. Act Two is about economic integration, about trying to make the leap from one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country to where our nation\u0027s richest people live.","Cedric Jennings went to Ballou High School in a poor, black neighborhood in Southeast Washington. It was the kind of school where honor students do not like it to be known that they\u0027re honor students. There aren\u0027t many of them, and when they spot their names posted on the big honor roll bulletin board by the main office, they would rush, some of them, to ask to be taken off. When administrators wanted to hold an assembly to give out academic awards, they would keep the purpose of the assembly secret even from the teachers because the teachers would then leak the information to the honor students who would then simply not show up.","Honor students at his high school were teased. They were called whitey. They were ostracized. They were threatened with physical violence. As an honor student, Cedric was constantly taunted. He ate lunch alone in an empty classroom. He went to church, never socialized with other kids, fearing it would make him lose focus.","Cedric bet everything in his life as a teenager on the hope that he would get a scholarship to a top college. Reporter Ron Suskind started following him around when Cedric was just 16. He stayed with him for two and a half years, published stories about him in The Wall Street Journal which won a Pulitzer Prize. Cedric\u0027s first serious encounter with the elite universities that he wanted to enter came after his junior year in that summer, a summer program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a program designed to attract minority students to MIT. The program was called MITES, M-I-T-E-S, the Minority Introduction To Engineering and Science, 50-some kids who supposedly came from neighborhoods like Cedric\u0027s.","Making it into the program was Cedric\u0027s dream. It was the first foothold in this new world he was trying to enter into. But when classes began, Cedric found that he could barely keep up. And even worse, he was just as isolated at MIT as he\u0027d been back at Ballou. Calculus, physics, chemistry were are filled with kids from middle-class backgrounds, good suburban schools, private schools. Some of them had seen this material before back home.","Oh, yeah. That one. Seen that one.","And we should say that at your high school back in Washington, in the public school, you were in the most advanced classes they offered.","There\u0027s this moment in this part of the story which is just completely heartbreaking to read where you get back your first test and you get a 4 out of 26 in your physics class.","And a 68 out of 104 in calculus. And you\u0027re a student who\u0027s used to getting all A\u0027s, ends up being the star of every class.","Ron, let me ask you to talk a little bit about why the MIT program was set up in this way. At one point, you met with Bill Ramsey, the 68-year-old African American who heads this program to get minorities into MIT. And he talked to you about why so many suburban kids were in the program and so few city kids.","Just reading your account of it, it seems like part of his concern too was that kids would come in without any preparation, or without enough preparation, to go as fast as MIT would want them to go. And then MIT had no infrastructure to bring them up to speed. And so it was just setting them up for failure.","So Cedric, at the end of your time with MIT, you\u0027re informed that you weren\u0027t ready for MIT just yet. And you headed back to DC and put in a lot more work and a lot more effort. And after you graduated from high school, you end up at an Ivy League school, Brown University. And let me ask you to describe, first of all, who your roommate was and what he was like. What was his background?","He went to private school.","This reminded me of when I\u0027ve been in Chicago high schools, how you\u0027ll see the white kids, the way they\u0027ll keep their clothes is they\u0027ll just dress like whatever and they\u0027ll look kind of bummy. Whereas the black kids, again, it\u0027s like everything always has to be neat and perfect. And even your clothes have to be just so perfect all the time. It\u0027s like they\u0027re from two different countries.","And Cedric, there were times that you were really isolated there.","Can I ask, when\u0027s the first time you actually drank?","You still have never had a beer at college?","Ron, let me ask you to read from page 197 in your book. At one point, you talk about just this clash of cultures.","Cedric, in your view, do you feel like the biggest difference between yourself and the people who you were meeting at Brown, do you think it was racial, or do you think it had more to do with class?","Explain that more.","Did you find in any way it was easier to be close to black kids from middle-class homes than it was to be close to white kids from middle-class homes?","There actually was a difference?","It\u0027s interesting thinking about this in terms of just the history of integration. Putting together this show, I was talking to one of my producers, and we were talking about how towards the end of Dr. King\u0027s life, one of the things that he looked at and started to think about was the question of OK, now under the law, blacks can go anywhere. But moving towards economic integration, moving people out of poor neighborhoods and up into the middle class seems so much more difficult. And reading the account of you at Brown trying to make that class jump just reiterates how hard it is.","Did you ever talk to her about that?","Well, yeah. I mean, look how far, look how much somebody had to push to make that happen.","When you look at your situation now, you\u0027re finishing your junior year right now--","It\u0027s finished. OK. Sorry.","Do you still feel like you\u0027re between worlds?","But at Brown, it\u0027s like being black but in their world.","Do you feel like you\u0027re in this kind of no man\u0027s land?","Like when?","Do you feel less alone, though it sounds like you\u0027re feeling more alone when you go back home to Southeast Washington? Do you feel less alone now when you\u0027re up at Brown? And in that world?","In terms of feeling at ease in the new world that you have moved into, if we would consider somebody like your roommate Rob, who kind of grew up in that world, as being completely at ease, he\u0027s 100% at ease, where would you say your percentage is now?","What\u0027s the 20% that still isn\u0027t there?","When you say you\u0027re not happy, you mean you\u0027re not happy in a day-to-day way, or you\u0027re not happy with how far you\u0027ve come?","I mean, I guess I could imagine the day-to-day part of it because it just seem like it\u0027s so much work--","--to keep things going.","You\u0027re thinking specifically about things that are happening now that you\u0027re back home for the summer?","And this is people who you respect saying this to you. People in your church.","Ron Suskind\u0027s great, great book about Cedric Jennings is called A Hope in the Unseen. You know, before our interview ended, I told Cedric about the story in the first half of today\u0027s show, about a black who said that he would date but never marry a white woman.","The way the other guy on the show explains it, there\u0027s a part of him which doesn\u0027t believe that a white woman could completely understand him."],"spokenWords":["Honor students at his high school were teased. They were called whitey. They were ostracized. They were threatened with physical violence. As an honor student, Cedric was constantly taunted. He ate lunch alone in an empty classroom. He went to church, never socialized with other kids, fearing it would make him lose focus.","There\u0027s this moment in this part of the story which is just completely heartbreaking to read where you get back your first test and you get a 4 out of 26 in your physics class.","Do you feel less alone, though it sounds like you\u0027re feeling more alone when you go back home to Southeast Washington? Do you feel less alone now when you\u0027re up at Brown? And in that world?","But at Brown, it\u0027s like being black but in their world.","Can I ask, when\u0027s the first time you actually drank?","It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Bring a Negro Boy Home Tonight. And if that seems like a strange title, then you\u0027re just going to have to start listening to these shows from the beginning. The show is stories of people defying some of the oldest codes of behavior in our country by mixing races. Act One of our show was about intermarriage. Act Two is about economic integration, about trying to make the leap from one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country to where our nation\u0027s richest people live.","He went to private school.","--to keep things going.","Ron Suskind\u0027s great, great book about Cedric Jennings is called A Hope in the Unseen.

And then MIT had no infrastructure to bring them up to speed. And so it was just setting them up for failure.","There actually was a difference?","Cedric bet everything in his life as a teenager on the hope that he would get a scholarship to a top college. Reporter Ron Suskind started following him around when Cedric was just 16. He stayed with him for two and a half years, published stories about him in The Wall Street Journal which won a Pulitzer Prize. Cedric\u0027s first serious encounter with the elite universities that he wanted to enter came after his junior year in that summer, a summer program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a program designed to attract minority students to MIT. The program was called MITES, M-I-T-E-S, the Minority Introduction To Engineering and Science, 50-some kids who supposedly came from neighborhoods like Cedric\u0027s.","Did you ever talk to her about that?","And this is people who you respect saying this to you. People in your church.","The way the other guy on the show explains it, there\u0027s a part of him which doesn\u0027t believe that a white woman could completely understand him.","You still have never had a beer at college?","And a 68 out of 104 in calculus. And you\u0027re a student who\u0027s used to getting all A\u0027s, ends up being the star of every class.","Well, yeah. I mean, look how far, look how much somebody had to push to make that happen.","Oh, yeah. That one. Seen that one.","You\u0027re thinking specifically about things that are happening now that you\u0027re back home for the summer?","Ron, let me ask you to read from page 197 in your book. At one point, you talk about just this clash of cultures.","Making it into the program was Cedric\u0027s dream. It was the first foothold in this new world he was trying to enter into. But when classes began, Cedric found that he could barely keep up. And even worse, he was just as isolated at MIT as he\u0027d been back at Ballou. Calculus, physics, chemistry were are filled with kids from middle-class backgrounds, good suburban schools, private schools. Some of them had seen this material before back home.","Explain that more.","Cedric, in your view, do you feel like the biggest difference between yourself and the people who you were meeting at Brown, do you think it was racial, or do you think it had more to do with class?","And we should say that at your high school back in Washington, in the public school, you were in the most advanced classes they offered.","And Cedric, there were times that you were really isolated there.","So Cedric, at the end of your time with MIT, you\u0027re informed that you weren\u0027t ready for MIT just yet. And you headed back to DC and put in a lot more work and a lot more effort. And after you graduated from high school, you end up at an Ivy League school, Brown University. And let me ask you to describe, first of all, who your roommate was and what he was like. What was his background?","When you look at your situation now, you\u0027re finishing your junior year right now--","Do you feel like you\u0027re in this kind of no man\u0027s land?","Like when?","Ron, let me ask you to talk a little bit about why the MIT program was set up in this way. At one point, you met with Bill Ramsey, the 68-year-old African American who heads this program to get minorities into MIT. And he talked to you about why so many suburban kids were in the program and so few city kids.","Cedric Jennings went to Ballou High School in a poor, black neighborhood in Southeast Washington. It was the kind of school where honor students do not like it to be known that they\u0027re honor students. There aren\u0027t many of them, and when they spot their names posted on the big honor roll bulletin board by the main office, they would rush, some of them, to ask to be taken off. When administrators wanted to hold an assembly to give out academic awards, they would keep the purpose of the assembly secret even from the teachers because the teachers would then leak the information to the honor students who would then simply not show up.","It\u0027s interesting thinking about this in terms of just the history of integration. Putting together this show, I was talking to one of my producers, and we were talking about how towards the end of Dr. King\u0027s life, one of the things that he looked at and started to think about was the question of OK, now under the law, blacks can go anywhere.

Whereas the black kids, again, it\u0027s like everything always has to be neat and perfect. And even your clothes have to be just so perfect all the time. It\u0027s like they\u0027re from two different countries.","Did you find in any way it was easier to be close to black kids from middle-class homes than it was to be close to white kids from middle-class homes?","Do you still feel like you\u0027re between worlds?","When you say you\u0027re not happy, you mean you\u0027re not happy in a day-to-day way, or you\u0027re not happy with how far you\u0027ve come?"]},"Ron Suskind":{"name":"Ron Suskind","episodes":{"105":"Take A Negro Home"},"statements":["Ramsey was a great guy who had been an MIT grad in 1951, when there were almost no blacks at MIT. And he was hopeful for better. He wanted what I think is the bigger and, in some ways, more important thing to occur in this MIT program when he took it over seven or eight years before Cedric got there. He wanted kids like Cedric, 50 kids like Cedric instead of one or two.","And what he realized early on is that it would run into all manner of dilemmas that go right to the core of some of the problems with the notion of Affirmative Action. MIT sponsors the program. MIT wants as many of these kids as possible to eventually end up in their freshman class to make that freshman class look like a rainbow, as they say.","And as people might mention, you can make the Ivy League, or any great college, look like a rainbow nowadays without ever having to go to the ghetto. You don\u0027t have to go there. There are plenty of middle and upper-middle-class black and Latino kids to fill those programs, kids who will eventually succeed at a top university. It\u0027s the other kids, kids like Cedric, for whom the distance is so vast to travel that for them, the failure rate is untenable for a place like MIT.","Absolutely. And they often have very big dreams, and they often come pushed forward by a whole community for whom they\u0027re the one who\u0027s going to make it. And that\u0027s a pretty heavy burden to carry to a place like MIT and then have all of that come crashing down on their head. Look, as Ramsey said, he said, look, the suicide rates up here are high enough as they are.","Ira, they just had utterly distinct ways of doing everything. Cedric\u0027s general heightened hygiene of having grown up in often squalid places, where Cedric was cleaning all the time. Cedric was always careful about how he looked and that he himself and his person was very clean. It was the opposite from Rob who never worried. This was just one of 1,000 things like that that immediately gripped the two of them in the room until the point where they almost came to blows.","But the thing, Ira, if you go into Cedric\u0027s church and you go into Cedric\u0027s environment, the only reason Cedric has got where he got is because he didn\u0027t taste of any of the plates at the buffet table of adolescent life in Southeast. Most of those plates are poisoned.","OK. \"Clearly, some East Andrews residents are spending serious time and energy having fun. Despite Brown\u0027s self consciousness about each student\u0027s individuality, the four preferred pastimes are the same here as they are at almost every other college-- drink beer, smoke pot, dance to deafening music until you drop, and on the rare occasion, get naked with some other warm body.","Possibly the best explanation why Cedric Jennings is in Brown\u0027s class of 1999 is that he managed to steer clear of the buffet table of adolescent experimentation, believing rightly, it turns out, that in his neighborhood, most of those dishes were poisoned. This was an extraordinary feat, considering how peer pressure at Ballou was backed up by violence. And the almost irresistible urge for teenagers to salve deep despair with sex, drugs, and music.","Cedric knows all this, just as he knows his resistance was made possible back when by his mother\u0027s fierce code. But eventually, something else took root. Cedric, needing to justify his monkish routine in high school night after night, developed a genuine belief that sacrifice, hard work, and extremely clean living would lead to rewards, including a scholarship to a top college. But now that he\u0027s made it, the guideposts are gone. And all around him, smart kids are getting high, getting drunk, and screwing. Even the real smart ones, kids who can eat Cedric\u0027s lunch in almost any subject.","Sitting alone on his bed one Saturday night, there\u0027s a knock on the door, and a few kids from down the hall crowd in, rosy with anticipation of a night of some drinking, an off-campus party one of them has heard about, and then, who knows, maybe some late-night pizza. \u0027Hey Cedric, come on,\u0027 one of them says.","\u0027Naw,\u0027 Cedric says, declining nicely, trying to show he appreciates their asking. \u0027I just don\u0027t do that kind of stuff.\u0027 And everyone nods meaningfully, though Cedric can tell they don\u0027t really understand.

Despite Brown\u0027s self consciousness about each student\u0027s individuality, the four preferred pastimes are the same here as they are at almost every other college-- drink beer, smoke pot, dance to deafening music until you drop, and on the rare occasion, get naked with some other warm body."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Possibly the best explanation why Cedric Jennings is in Brown\u0027s class of 1999 is that he managed to steer clear of the buffet table of adolescent experimentation, believing rightly, it turns out, that in his neighborhood, most of those dishes were poisoned. This was an extraordinary feat, considering how peer pressure at Ballou was backed up by violence. And the almost irresistible urge for teenagers to salve deep despair with sex, drugs, and music."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Cedric knows all this, just as he knows his resistance was made possible back when by his mother\u0027s fierce code. But eventually, something else took root. Cedric, needing to justify his monkish routine in high school night after night, developed a genuine belief that sacrifice, hard work, and extremely clean living would lead to rewards, including a scholarship to a top college. But now that he\u0027s made it, the guideposts are gone. And all around him, smart kids are getting high, getting drunk, and screwing. Even the real smart ones, kids who can eat Cedric\u0027s lunch in almost any subject."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Sitting alone on his bed one Saturday night, there\u0027s a knock on the door, and a few kids from down the hall crowd in, rosy with anticipation of a night of some drinking, an off-campus party one of them has heard about, and then, who knows, maybe some late-night pizza. \u0027Hey Cedric, come on,\u0027 one of them says."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"\u0027Naw,\u0027 Cedric says, declining nicely, trying to show he appreciates their asking. \u0027I just don\u0027t do that kind of stuff.\u0027 And everyone nods meaningfully, though Cedric can tell they don\u0027t really understand. In a moment, they\u0027re gone. Just as well, he thinks, half-meaning it. I can\u0027t change now.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Cedric, in your view, do you feel like the biggest difference between yourself and the people who you were meeting at Brown, do you think it was racial, or do you think it had more to do with class?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I think it had more to do with class. I mean, obviously race. I was among a few minorities. But obviously class."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Explain that more."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Even within a minority community, most of my peers in the minority community had gone to private schools. They were pretty much from middle-class, upper-class homes. Mothers and fathers, who were both college educated in a lot of cases, were both living at home with them. It was just totally the opposite of where I had come from. And in a lot of ways, I just felt isolated all over again, like being at MIT."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you find in any way it was easier to be close to black kids from middle-class homes than it was to be close to white kids from middle-class homes?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"There actually was a difference?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah. We had more in common. We had more in common. We were working toward the same thing, pretty much."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s interesting thinking about this in terms of just the history of integration. Putting together this show, I was talking to one of my producers, and we were talking about how towards the end of Dr. King\u0027s life, one of the things that he looked at and started to think about was the question of OK, now under the law, blacks can go anywhere. But moving towards economic integration, moving people out of poor neighborhoods and up into the middle class seems so much more difficult. And reading the account of you at Brown trying to make that class jump just reiterates how hard it is."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"It\u0027s extremely hard. It\u0027s hard to see with my mother and everything. At first, I must admit I was a little ashamed of her coming to Brown because I knew that she was not like any of the other parents in terms of what we had. I mean, when I look back on it, I actually was ashamed because I knew that the other parents, they had a lot of advantages and they had things in life. And a lot of them had it easy. They got it easy."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"And my mother, we come from welfare. She\u0027s on welfare. She had dropped out of high school and gotten pregnant at an early age. And she got a GED. She wasn\u0027t college educated. So sometimes I was ashamed of the fact that my mother wasn\u0027t on the same level as the other parents."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you ever talk to her about that?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"No. Because I\u0027ve been ashamed to admit that to her. For a long time, I had been in denial about that. But I\u0027m not ashamed of her anymore. I\u0027ve grown out of that. I\u0027m proud of her, as a matter of fact. I\u0027m proud of her."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, yeah. I mean, look how far, look how much somebody had to push to make that happen."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"That counts more than a college degree."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you look at your situation now, you\u0027re finishing your junior year right now--"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Oh, it\u0027s finished."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s finished. OK. Sorry."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I\u0027m a senior, man. I\u0027m a senior."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you still feel like you\u0027re between worlds?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Oh, yeah. All the time. All the time. In one setting, the community where I come from, it\u0027s about not become white. And then at Brown, it\u0027s like not becoming-- yeah, it\u0027s the same thing, sort of. Not becoming white, remaining black in both worlds. Except it\u0027s sort of--"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But at Brown, it\u0027s like being black but in their world."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Being black but in their world. Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you feel like you\u0027re in this kind of no man\u0027s land?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Sometimes. Sometimes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Like when?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"This is difficult. It\u0027s hard. I\u0027ve never really given it a lot of thought. I don\u0027t know. I get a lot of grief when I come home, especially from people in my church, people in my community, about going off to this white man\u0027s land. And it\u0027s just, you shouldn\u0027t do it, they\u0027re going to eat you alive. I mean, I still get that sometimes. And it does isolate me at times. And yeah, sometimes I do, I feel alone. I guess that\u0027s what you asked me. Do I feel alone, isolated in terms of my decision of going to Brown, venturing out? Yeah, I do. I do feel alone."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you feel less alone, though it sounds like you\u0027re feeling more alone when you go back home to Southeast Washington? Do you feel less alone now when you\u0027re up at Brown? And in that world?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I do. Because I\u0027ve grown more comfortable with Brown."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In terms of feeling at ease in the new world that you have moved into, if we would consider somebody like your roommate Rob, who kind of grew up in that world, as being completely at ease, he\u0027s 100% at ease, where would you say your percentage is now?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"80%."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What\u0027s the 20% that still isn\u0027t there?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I still have a lot of growing up to do. I\u0027ve come from Ballou High School, which is considered one of the worst high schools in DC. I\u0027ve gone off to one of the best universities in the country. And I\u0027m still not happy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you say you\u0027re not happy, you mean you\u0027re not happy in a day-to-day way, or you\u0027re not happy with how far you\u0027ve come?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"A combination of both."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I mean, I guess I could imagine the day-to-day part of it because it just seem like it\u0027s so much work--"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"It is."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"--to keep things going."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"This is really difficult for me to talk about. So you\u0027ve got to bear with me here. Plus I haven\u0027t given this much thought. Success is a trip. Because we push people, especially blacks, to be successful, minorities to be successful. And then once they get there, and once we get there, for some reason, we pull each other back."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You\u0027re thinking specifically about things that are happening now that you\u0027re back home for the summer?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah. My biggest problems are at home. My biggest worries are at home. All these people who just bombard me with what they-- for some people, me going to Brown is like I\u0027ve given up, or turned my back to the fact that I\u0027m black, which is totally not the case."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And this is people who you respect saying this to you. People in your church."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"People that I respected. People that I thought were really behind me. That\u0027s the toughest part. And that\u0027s what\u0027s hard. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to deal with. Success is almost as worse as failure."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Ron Suskind\u0027s great, great book about Cedric Jennings is called A Hope in the Unseen. You know, before our interview ended, I told Cedric about the story in the first half of today\u0027s show, about a black who said that he would date but never marry a white woman."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"That\u0027s interesting because I think the same way. Somebody asked me, first they asked me, would you marry a white woman? And I said no. And they said, well, would you date a white woman? And I said, yeah, I would date a white woman."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The way the other guy on the show explains it, there\u0027s a part of him which doesn\u0027t believe that a white woman could completely understand him."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"True, I guess. But I don\u0027t know. When two people bond in love, I think that they definitely understand things about each other, like more than what he\u0027s giving them credit for."}]},"4":{"actNumber":4,"actName":"Credits","contributorMap":{"Julia":{"name":"Julia","episodes":{"105":"Take A Negro Home"},"statements":["--faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove."],"spokenWords":["--faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove."]},"null":{"episodes":{"105":"Take A Negro Home"},"statements":["If you want to buy a cassette of this program, call us at WBEZ here in Chicago, the phone number 312-832-3380. 312-832-3380.

At the last minute, we were able to get Mayor Daley as speaker. He presented a very interesting talk. The highlight of it was a discussion of the forthcoming campaign \u0027Take a Negro Boy Home Tonight,\u0027 which all agreed was a fine step forward in human relations. It is to be inaugurated soon in the city\u0027s high schools."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Mayor Daley told us that he had been advised by an outstanding sociologist that the vicious hates and fears rooted in racial prejudice and fascist bigotry could best be combated by closer and more intimate relationships between Negro boys and white girls. Therefore this new campaign will encourage white high school girls to volunteer to take Negro boys to their homes for dinner and date them afterwards. These girls will get higher marks and other privileges for promoting interracial harmony. This will show the white parents that it\u0027s all right to have these associations."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Now we must all do our part. Make sure that Negro boys invited to the white folks\u0027 houses take a bath first and put on a white shirt. Then he will prove that he\u0027s a good companion for the white girls and socially acceptable. Please cooperate to make Mayor Daley\u0027s campaign a success.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then after that, the editorial continues. \"So that\u0027s the way they\u0027re trying to establish racial equality in Chicago, equality with miscegenation, mixed marriages, wholesale adultery, bastardy, and mongrelization. It is happening in Chicago. It will be tried in Mississippi if the NAACP ever gets a foot in the door.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, you know, the most interesting thing about this campaign, \"Take a Negro Boy Home Tonight,\" is that it is complete fiction. No such campaign ever existed in Chicago. And if it did, you know, it\u0027s unimaginable to any real Chicagoan that the late Mayor Richard J. Daley would have endorsed it. These kinds of articles appeared in Southern newspapers at least as far back as the 1920s. Lies made up by segregationist forces to scare white people about this threat, racial integration."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And the lies worked for a while. And then integration came anyway. Which brings us to today\u0027s radio program. Today we bring you two stories of people who tried, in one way or another, to bring a Negro boy home for the night. Act One is a story about intermarriage. Act Two is a story about trying to take a kid out of the ghetto and put him into the Ivy League, and why that\u0027s so difficult. From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Stay with us."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"October 30, 1966. Hello, home. Well, I went to have the tire patched--\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is a typical letter home from college. There\u0027s chitchat about a tire that needed to be fixed and senior class pictures, how much they should cost, and should she pay for better ones so her grandmother could have a better one? And then slowly, the woman writing this letter gets to the whole point of the letter."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"I went to a good play last night, Misalliance by George Bernard Shaw. A friend of mine was in it, but he wasn\u0027t any good. I went with Richard Robinson.\" Oh! \"A track runner, singer, dancer, all-around good looker, religious, and liked by everyone. He\u0027s one of the nicest people I know. And he\u0027s Negro."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I had to tell you. I\u0027ve never kept any secrets from you and this wasn\u0027t going to be one. I hope you\u0027re not angry. Even you would like him. No one minded. Bill Crowell was there and real nice to both of us. I don\u0027t know why there has to be a racial problem anyway. I had so much better time with him than I do with Bob or David [? Kiechle ?] or Bill Crowell or Roger Heckerman and he treated me like a queen. Sad, isn\u0027t it? Please don\u0027t think I\u0027m being a rebel. I love you both very much and am proud to be close enough to my parents to tell them everything, whether or not I know they will disagree with me. I\u0027m sure it makes us all better people. I love you, OK? Love, Julia."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, the narrator of our first story is not actually this woman. It\u0027s her son named Rich Robinson, one of the three children she had with the Negro boy after she brought him home for the night and married him. She and her husband got together in that period in the \u002760s after the passage of the Voting Rights Act and before the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And they lived the dream of interracial marriage for 12 years. And then, around the time that our nation started edging away from the goals and ideals of the Civil Rights Movement, they split up."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The woman, Julia, has remarried to a white guy named Jan. The man, Richard Sr., remarried to a black woman named Debbie. And each of them returned to their separate, segregated worlds, leaving the kids to figure out what to make of the whole experiment. To what degree did race push them apart, destroy their marriage? And for that matter, to what degree had race brought them together in the first place?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, a few months ago, their son, Rich Robinson, went to figure all this out. And they were subjects that he had never discussed, incredibly had never discussed, with either of his parents. Here\u0027s his story."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"When I started working on this story, I didn\u0027t realize there was a question about my life-- my life today-- at the heart of it. Then one Sunday morning, I got into this discussion with my roommates. And the topic switched from my parents to mixed marriages in the \u002760s to me. I was saying that I date both white and black women. They were saying I was crazy."},{"speakerName":"Male Roommate","text":"OK, Sam?"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"She was half."},{"speakerName":"Female Roommate","text":"She was half Venezuelan. That\u0027s not--"},{"speakerName":"Male Roommate","text":"She was white. She was white all through--"},{"speakerName":"Female Roommate","text":"She was white."},{"speakerName":"Male Roommate","text":"--and through, my friend."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"They start listing all the women that they know I\u0027ve dated, about seven of them. Sam was half Colombian, Julianna, who\u0027s Brazilian, Amanda--"},{"speakerName":"Male Roommate","text":"Amanda. Can you get any whiter? She\u0027s more white than the white people that I know. I don\u0027t know. Who else? Pam? Amy? Can\u0027t get any whiter than that. Julianna. OK, I\u0027ll give you a 10% darkness over there. Why are you so worried about this thing? Are you worried that you\u0027re going to end up marrying a white girl?"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"First of all, I\u0027m never going to marry a white girl."},{"speakerName":"Female Roommate","text":"Why?"},{"speakerName":"Male Roommate","text":"Why is that?"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"It\u0027s just a bad idea."},{"speakerName":"Male Roommate","text":"Why?"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Because they\u0027ll never understand."},{"text":"I hadn\u0027t put a lot of thought behind my answer to their question. I just knew in my mind that I had an answer, though I had never said this out loud to anyone. I always just assumed I would never marry a white girl, that those relationships don\u0027t work out, probably because I watched my parents\u0027 interracial marriage end. I assumed that race had something to do with it, that my blond-haired, blue-eyed, Indiana farm girl mother and my black, Brooklyn-born father were doomed from the start, destined to end up in separate worlds."},{"text":"Now that they\u0027re divorced, my parents\u0027 integration is completely undone, except for my sisters and me. Though, if you ask my white grandmother, my mother\u0027s mother, my sisters and I aren\u0027t proof of anything."},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"I said you don\u0027t sound like a black person than you aren\u0027t black, because I\u0027m white and you\u0027re my grandson."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"So black people should sound a certain way?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"They do. I don\u0027t know why they should or not."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Do all white people sound alike?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"Well, they don\u0027t-- there\u0027s a few them that may sound a little black or a little like they\u0027re from the South, I should say. But I don\u0027t know. No no, no. Of course they don\u0027t all sound black. But you sure don\u0027t."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Well, what does black sound like?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"Well, I want to know why you didn\u0027t have many black friends in high school. I never saw you with a black person in high school. Are you about to tell me that you had some black friends in high school?"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Would that make me black?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"Well, I just wonder. I\u0027m just getting back at you. You\u0027re almost like you\u0027re accusing me."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"So how do you see your grandkids racially, then?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"White. I really do."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Why is that?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"Because I\u0027m white. I don\u0027t-- I can\u0027t help it. I just can\u0027t see you being black. I just can\u0027t. Really."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Is it embarrassing to think you have black grandchildren?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma","text":"Not to me, it isn\u0027t. I don\u0027t think I got any black grandchildren. Not at all."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"So my grandmother has an issue with me being black, my parents have issues with each other, and I have issues with white girls. But that\u0027s today, when everything is already messed up. Let\u0027s go back to a simpler time, before it all began."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Both my parents went to Indiana University in the \u002760s. That\u0027s where they met. Mom had been valedictorian. She was in college on scholarship. She was going to be a foreign language major, and when she graduated, she was going to be a translator for the UN. Part of the plan was to go to Europe for a semester. When she came back, her roommate had been assigned to someone else, and she had gotten a new roommate, a black girl named Clara."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And that was my first experience of really mixing with the black kids, because Clara and I would go to lunch together, or meals together. And I would sit at a table with black kids. And so that was really kind of how it happened."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And then I started going to functions with Clara. Clara would go to the black fraternity and sorority parties and I would go. I don\u0027t know if I would have done that before I went to Europe. I think going to Europe had something to do with it just because it broadened my way of thinking, perhaps. If I hadn\u0027t gone to Europe and been assigned a black roommate, I don\u0027t think it would have happened."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Well, I used to go watch him practice track a lot, which was over here. You want to go over there? Because that was--"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"My mom and I drove around the Indiana University campus. She showed me where she and my dad met, where they lived, and where they went to parties and dances at my dad\u0027s black fraternity, Omega Psi Phi."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"You know the other thing that was just kind of hard for me to get used to was that their parties never started until 10:00 at night. At least 10:00, maybe later. And we had dorm curfews then. And I was still a pretty good girl. I didn\u0027t stay out all night. So I had to stay out all night with him because I couldn\u0027t get back into the dorm. And that was an annoyance to me. I always thought, why can\u0027t they start the parties like normal white people do?"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"[LAUGHTER]"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And this is the other thing. Everybody else would be gone on their dates already. And I would be the only person left in the dorm waiting for this black party to start! Me and the black girls left in the dorm. All the white girls are gone already."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"My mom was so white to me at that moment. Growing up, I just thought of her as my mother. But as she told me this, she seemed like the whitest white person in the world. I asked my mom how she met my father. She said they met in a cafeteria. She said Clara and her were getting lunch."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I remember exactly how this happened. We were standing in line at the cafeteria, and Richard was so many people in front of us around the corner, like we could see him maybe 30 feet away. And I said, \"Clare, I want you to introduce me to him. He is gorgeous.\" And he has something about his legs. Because he used to wear these faded, almost threadbare corduroys that fit him like a glove. And his muscles were so defined from track that his leg muscles would just bulge through these-- [GIGGLES]. And I wanted to meet him because of his legs. This is terrible. It was totally lust."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"What attracted you to Mom?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I think it was the times that we were going through, in terms of Martin Luther King era, in regard to looking toward being open to any race and thinking things were going to change. And then everybody was going to be accepted as anyone else."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"That\u0027s about as far as my father goes when he talks about dating my mom. He doesn\u0027t talk about her. He talks about the openness of the \u002760s and the attitude of the era, as if the \u002760s had been dating my mom instead of him. My mom also recalls being caught up in the times."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I remember very clearly believing that it was going to be a different world, and that-- you know, John F. Kennedy and then Martin Luther King-- that the world was going to change and that we wouldn\u0027t live in a racially divided country anymore. And so I had no doubt at that time that my kids would live in a totally different environment than I had grown up in, that there wouldn\u0027t be any racial prejudice when you guys were growing up."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Neither of my parents was an activist. They weren\u0027t trying to change the world. But clearly half the fun of finding each other was the thrill of mixing with someone of the other race. After a year of dating, my mom got pregnant and they decided to get married. The ceremony was small. Both my parents\u0027 families disapproved of the marriage. In fact, my father\u0027s sister Bernice remembers my white grandmother call my black grandmother on the phone before the wedding to propose that they form an interracial coalition to stop the marriage. Neither grandmother admits to remembering this, but neither came to the wedding either."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Oh, this was written the night of our wedding."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"Tonight is the night, as I guess Janey has told you. We talked to Pastor Stefan Tuesday evening and decided to arrange things for this weekend since the next two weeks are going to be full of study for final exams and moving, we hope. I\u0027m going to wear that pale blue cocktail dress, size 11, it fits me again, and a white mantilla and black patent shoes."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Daddy, I\u0027m sending you my tax statement. Would you rather I fill out the forms? I\u0027m taking Personal Finance next semester which will teach me all about insurance and taxes and things like that. Have you told Grandma and Grandpa yet or Janine and Buddy? Is it all right if I write to the aunts and uncles? Whatever you want me to do is OK, but I\u0027d rather tell everyone now. That\u0027s all for now, I guess. I\u0027m so sorry that this is so hard for you to understand and accept. I know it will be an uphill road from now on, but we could do it. Much love, Jul.\""},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And after I was married to him, it didn\u0027t take me very long to realize that it was going to be a fairly successful marriage because his value system was very close to mine. He\u0027s very family oriented. He came from a middle-class upbringing which valued education. And so I didn\u0027t think it was very difficult to be married to him, even though I hadn\u0027t planned to, because the things that I wanted out of a marriage, he wanted too. And just little simple things, like going to the grocery store and being able to pick out food that I knew he was going to eat. I didn\u0027t have to cook chitlins, which-- I guess it was easier than I expected. That\u0027s a stupid example."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"But I didn\u0027t have to change anything about the way I already was. Church. He went to church with me every Sunday. He fit right in. When he was in his fraternity, him and his group of fraternity friends, he was very outgoing, funny, loud-- like you are. People laughed when he made jokes. And he could sing really good. And a lot of the fraternity functions, they would have what they called a line. And he was in this little quartet with Arthur-somebody from New York. And John Brooks was in the quartet and somebody else. And they did all these little Temptation numbers where they would dance together."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"And so most of the time when I was with him, he was fun to be around. But what was lacking, I guess, the jump between that and getting married was that we never had any conversation. I didn\u0027t know him at all. Other than the fact that we had sex together all the time, it wasn\u0027t like you\u0027d sit down and have long conversations getting to know each other. Because he doesn\u0027t talk. You can\u0027t get to know somebody who doesn\u0027t talk."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Bernice and Grandma said they were both surprised when he said he was getting married. And one of the reasons was, \"Cause he don\u0027t talk!\""},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"That\u0027s right! It would be the same--"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"This is the thing about my father, he doesn\u0027t talk. Everyone in the family knows this. It\u0027s an established fact, an elemental property of my dad. My grandmother says he learned this from her."},{"speakerName":"Grandma Robinson","text":"That\u0027s the best way. Don\u0027t you think? When you talk so much, you get in trouble."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"With who?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma Robinson","text":"Those think it best you don\u0027t talk so much."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Oh, yeah?"},{"speakerName":"Grandma Robinson","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"The long-term plan after graduation was to move to Brooklyn, back to my dad\u0027s hometown. My mother wrote home about it."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"Robby is so excited about going back. All his friends are there and I don\u0027t think he ever wants to live anywhere else. I want to have a house in the country, but--\" God, I can\u0027t believe I thought I was getting a house in the country near New York!"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"[LAUGHTER]"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Jesus!"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"That\u0027s awesome."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"\"Say hi--\" I\u0027m telling you, Rich! You don\u0027t understand. I was so small-towny."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Had you been to New York?"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"No. Obviously not."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"It turns out my dad romanticized some things too. Brooklyn had changed a lot since he grew up. Now there were bums in the park, abandoned stores, and riot gates. At the school where my dad worked, the kids were breaking windows and starting fires and attacking teachers. My dad hated that there was nowhere he felt safe letting us kids run around. And my mom hated sharing a kitchen with the cockroaches."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Their apartment was right next to the El, so it was loud and everything-- furniture, clothes, kids-- was always covered in a fine layer of soot. And they were real poor. My father\u0027s substitute teaching job barely paid the rent. In Indiana, my parents had fun together. It wasn\u0027t like that in New York. Everything was all about working and struggling to survive. Finally, someone threw a brick through their window, breaking glass all over the living room where my sister and I had been playing only a few minutes earlier."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Within a week, my parents packed up a U-Haul and drove straight back to Indiana. They lived in Brooklyn only six months."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"If there\u0027s a tragedy in this story, it begins here. As hard as things were in Brooklyn, I think my parents\u0027 marriage could have made it there, with my dad living in a world he was used to, surrounded by friends and family, and my mother happily exploring a different world. But Indianapolis ate away at my father. At first, it was just like he wanted. The streets were wide, clean, and empty, with trees on both sides and grass that was always greener. A canal meanders through the city."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Indianapolis was the opposite of Brooklyn. It made parenting easy and fun. We flew kites in the summer and built snow forts in the winter. I found an old reel-to-reel tape of my father, my sister, and me in those early days."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"What did we make yesterday?"},{"speakerName":"Young Rich Robinson","text":"Snowman."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Which one? A Mama or a Daddy snowman?"},{"speakerName":"Young Rich Robinson","text":"Today, we made a snowman [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Today, I\u0027ll go make a Daddy snowman."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"That\u0027s great. We\u0027ll make a Daddy snowman today."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"[BABY NOISES]"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"We spent Christmas that first year at my grandparents\u0027 80-acre farm with my mother\u0027s family. Dad saw how beautiful it was there, how perfect for us kids to run around and explore. We went back for Easter and then Thanksgiving and Christmas again and every year for the next eight years. We practically had forgot about my dad\u0027s family in Brooklyn. That\u0027s how my dad\u0027s sister, Bernice, remembers it."},{"speakerName":"Bernice","text":"And we didn\u0027t see Richard again for about 10 years. The only thing we knew is-- we called every now and then. And we knew that he had moved into a trailer and he had bought a house and then he sold that house and he was somewhere else. We just kind of casually kept in contact with him. And that was it. We\u0027d get a Christmas card. And maybe once a year, we\u0027d get a phone call. That was it. He was completely detached from the family."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"In this new world, no one was black except my father. He never saw his family, he didn\u0027t make any friends, he didn\u0027t keep in touch with his old college friends. I asked my dad who he hung out with in Indiana when my parents were married."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I don\u0027t know whether you\u0027d say hang out. There was occasions that you\u0027d go to in terms of gatherings, but I didn\u0027t hang out with anyone."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Huh. Who hung out with your friends?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I had things to do. I was pretty much on my own or pretty much an entity within myself. It was just mainly children, my children. It wasn\u0027t many friends at all."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I used to think then, I used to think it was very sad. I remember feeling this way. The few times that we went back to New York, he would flip into a whole alter person, second person-- like a schizophrenic personality, a totally different person. We\u0027d go to New York. He\u0027d be hanging out with Poke, laughing. His brother, laughing. His sister, laughing. Drinking a lot, partying, just like I remembered him in college before we got married."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"It was like all of a sudden, we\u0027re back in this fraternity party mode again, real easy about everything, never uptight, never with this, you know the stand that he does with his hands across his chest where he looks like he\u0027s holding everything in, being tough? He never stands like that in New York. And so he was just back to his normal self. And then we\u0027d come back to Indiana and he\u0027d go back into this person again, like he was this black man living in this white world kind of thing, that he wasn\u0027t himself."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Your dad never took me to a black function. Everything we did was in my world. So I don\u0027t think that was fair. I didn\u0027t marry into that."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"When I was dating him, the thing I liked about him was that I was living in another culture environment. You have to understand, I\u0027m a foreign language major. I like cultures. It\u0027s important to me. So he kind of deprived me, or our marriage I think, of that cultural experience because he didn\u0027t contribute to it."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"My father became someone else in Indiana, a completely different person. And this new face he put on is the face that I recognize and that I picture when I think about him. I can\u0027t imagine my father dancing and drinking or laughing with a posse of black friends. My father is someone who never took a sick day from work, who was always home and always responsible. He is a withdrawn and lonely father of three in a white city."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"No, it didn\u0027t pan out that well for myself. No, I didn\u0027t have much of anything. I just kind of walked away from all I knew and everything that was a part of me. If there was a personality change, it might have been as a result of that."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"So how did you survive?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Well, I didn\u0027t think about. I just worked and raised the children. At the time, that was what was important."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"I stood face to face in a doorway with my father talking about this for an hour. Neither of us moved. Neither of us sat down. And as we unearthed this, I felt sorry for him and I understood why he had become who he was. It wasn\u0027t exactly that race destroyed their marriage, but it added to his isolation and subtracted from his person. And that, in the end, destroyed what they had together."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Before I started doing this story, I never talked to my parents about how their marriage failed or what their divorce was supposed to mean for me, expressly about who I choose to marry or not marry. Getting my dad to sit down for one last round of questions about this wasn\u0027t easy."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"You have to talk to me. Do you know what my story is, Dad?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Well, I\u0027ll talk, but I don\u0027t want to talk forever and ever."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Well, let me ask you if you know what my-- do you know what I\u0027m doing a story on? I\u0027m doing a story on my parents. You and Mom. I\u0027m trying to use-- I mean, I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m using you as an example in my life, but I\u0027m trying to get a message from you on what I should do, because you never, I don\u0027t know. You never say anything. So I\u0027m just trying to figure it out."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"And here\u0027s what I see. You got married to a white woman, in whatever, \u002767. You guys got divorced, and all of a sudden, you\u0027re over here in a completely-- now, you\u0027re in an all-black world, right?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Well, I work with white teachers."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Well, all your friends, your family. You\u0027re happy now. And she\u0027s over there in an all-white world. I mean, is that a lesson?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I do think it\u0027s very important not to go into something-- marriage, as you\u0027re saying, as you asked me about mixed situation-- if you\u0027re very, very young."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Well, what about if you\u0027re old?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"If you\u0027re older and you\u0027ve got your structure, you\u0027ve got your friends, in terms of--"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"So you don\u0027t think it\u0027s a mistake at all."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I think you can do all right. And where you live is still kind of important, in terms of the state. If a person were in New York or perhaps even California-- and there\u0027s probably other places that I don\u0027t know about, then it doesn\u0027t really matter what."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"This is not the answer I expected from him. He thinks intermarriage can work so long as you\u0027re not isolated from your own race the way he was in Indiana. It\u0027s not the answer I wanted."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"You know what my-- I have this Asian friend. Girlfriend. Well, friend-girl. You know what she said to me about mixed marriages? She said, you can never marry a white girl because she\u0027ll never understand."},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"Well, I don\u0027t know what there is in back of that thought, in terms of what she\u0027s saying, other than if she\u0027s saying that they\u0027ll never understand where you\u0027re coming from in terms of your history, or something like that, if you haven\u0027t felt it, tasted it, lived it, I don\u0027t know. So some things will probably go beyond explanation. You just know. If you have to start explaining this, it don\u0027t work. Impossible."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"His answer is sort of ambiguous, but the way I take this, and the way I want to take this, is that he agrees with me, that a white woman will never understand."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Did Mom ever understand?"},{"speakerName":"Richard Robinson","text":"I don\u0027t know if I could say she understood or not understood. But I think that she is a product of her upbringing. And I am a product of my upbringing. And that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s bad, but it is somewhat different."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Again, his answer is blurry, but that\u0027s just the way he talks. I\u0027m pretty sure what he\u0027s saying is that she didn\u0027t understand. My mom disagrees completely. When I call her up to talk about this, I tell her that the lesson I take from their divorce is that interracial marriage doesn\u0027t work."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Would I agree with that? No. Not at all. No, I really don\u0027t think that it had anything to do with race. I think it had to do with other things. I always thought that our marriage was like anybody else\u0027s marriage. You talk about the same things. You talk about money or your kids or what you\u0027re going to do on the weekend or whatever. The color of skin was the only thing that was different. But the falling apart had nothing to do with that, I don\u0027t think. At least not from my point of view. It may have from your dad\u0027s. But it didn\u0027t for me at all."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Well, since college, I kind of changed my opinion. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ever going to-- I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to marry white. And one of my friends was telling me, and she kind of gave me the good reason in my head, she said, \"You can never marry a white woman because she\u0027ll never understand.\""},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Well, that\u0027s probably true. I\u0027m not going to be upset if you marry a black girl, for sure. I don\u0027t care one way or the other, as long as you\u0027re happy. These are issues like religion. Everybody has their own personal feeling about it, and you don\u0027t have to agree."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"I ask my mom what I asked my dad, if she thinks a white woman can understand a black man, specifically me."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"If you are open I think they can. When people get married to each other, they\u0027re supposed to be intimate with all of their thoughts. And if you are, then you can understand another person. I don\u0027t think the race gets in the way of that."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Well, why do you think it makes a difference to me then?"},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Maybe you\u0027re more conscious of it because you\u0027re neither."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"It\u0027s not true."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"I don\u0027t know. Do you feel uncomfortable in both worlds in a way?"},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Yeah. And I don\u0027t really want to lose either part."},{"speakerName":"Julia","text":"Well, that\u0027s one of those human dilemmas. You just have to work on it for the rest of your life."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"Here\u0027s what I figured out doing this story. I still can\u0027t imagine marrying a white woman, but not because I believe race destroyed my parents\u0027 marriage. I don\u0027t really believe that anymore. but because I realize I\u0027m used to crossing between two worlds, and I want someone who can do that with me. And for better or worse, right or wrong, I just can\u0027t imagine having a blond-haired, blue-eyed girlfriend standing next to me at the Black Poets Society."},{"speakerName":"Rich Robinson","text":"As for my parents, my mom says she barely knows any black people anymore. And with each passing decade, she says, her world has gotten whiter. Meanwhile, my father\u0027s going to dances again put on by the Kappas, the same fraternity that threw most of the parties while he was in college. But this time, when Marvin Gaye comes on, the woman he\u0027s dancing with is black instead of white. And I can picture him later in the night off in some corner of the room singing \"My Girl\" in a line with his brothers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Rich Robinson in New York City. The number of interracial marriages in the United States was 1.1 million couples in the 1990 census. That\u0027s three times more than in 1970, but still less than 2% of all marriages."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC - \"DON\u0027T BE AFRAID OF LOVE\" BY OTIS REDDING]"},{"text":"Coming up, another person attempts to do what drove fear in the hearts of segregationists not that long ago. That\u0027s in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Bring a Negro Boy Home Tonight. And if that seems like a strange title, then you\u0027re just going to have to start listening to these shows from the beginning. The show is stories of people defying some of the oldest codes of behavior in our country by mixing races. Act One of our show was about intermarriage. Act Two is about economic integration, about trying to make the leap from one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country to where our nation\u0027s richest people live."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Cedric Jennings went to Ballou High School in a poor, black neighborhood in Southeast Washington. It was the kind of school where honor students do not like it to be known that they\u0027re honor students. There aren\u0027t many of them, and when they spot their names posted on the big honor roll bulletin board by the main office, they would rush, some of them, to ask to be taken off. When administrators wanted to hold an assembly to give out academic awards, they would keep the purpose of the assembly secret even from the teachers because the teachers would then leak the information to the honor students who would then simply not show up."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Well, although I was really proud of my accomplishments, I didn\u0027t want to actually see my peers respond to me in a negative way so I just avoided the assembly."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Honor students at his high school were teased. They were called whitey. They were ostracized. They were threatened with physical violence. As an honor student, Cedric was constantly taunted. He ate lunch alone in an empty classroom. He went to church, never socialized with other kids, fearing it would make him lose focus."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"When a person says that they want to be successful, they have to realize that there will be opposition. And despite what opposition says, when someone says you can\u0027t, I had this defiant side of myself. When I said, oh, I can\u0027t? No, I think I can."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Cedric bet everything in his life as a teenager on the hope that he would get a scholarship to a top college. Reporter Ron Suskind started following him around when Cedric was just 16. He stayed with him for two and a half years, published stories about him in The Wall Street Journal which won a Pulitzer Prize. Cedric\u0027s first serious encounter with the elite universities that he wanted to enter came after his junior year in that summer, a summer program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a program designed to attract minority students to MIT. The program was called MITES, M-I-T-E-S, the Minority Introduction To Engineering and Science, 50-some kids who supposedly came from neighborhoods like Cedric\u0027s."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Making it into the program was Cedric\u0027s dream. It was the first foothold in this new world he was trying to enter into. But when classes began, Cedric found that he could barely keep up. And even worse, he was just as isolated at MIT as he\u0027d been back at Ballou. Calculus, physics, chemistry were are filled with kids from middle-class backgrounds, good suburban schools, private schools. Some of them had seen this material before back home."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"It was really a disappointment. And it sort of made me feel inadequate during the process, when I\u0027m taking all the notes and they\u0027re just nodding their heads like, oh, yeah. OK."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Oh, yeah. That one. Seen that one."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah, I\u0027ve heard that before."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And we should say that at your high school back in Washington, in the public school, you were in the most advanced classes they offered."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Right. And even in the most advanced classes they offered, I had done above and beyond. So I thought that that would be enough to prepare me. And I guess it wasn\u0027t."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"There\u0027s this moment in this part of the story which is just completely heartbreaking to read where you get back your first test and you get a 4 out of 26 in your physics class."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"So bad."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And a 68 out of 104 in calculus. And you\u0027re a student who\u0027s used to getting all A\u0027s, ends up being the star of every class."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Well, it was a learning experience. It was disappointing, first of all. Physics was just ridiculous. I thought I was just going to go crazy. And I thought I was just going to go crazy. In physics, 4 out of 26. That is just ridiculous. There was nothing that anyone could say to make me feel better about that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Ron, let me ask you to talk a little bit about why the MIT program was set up in this way. At one point, you met with Bill Ramsey, the 68-year-old African American who heads this program to get minorities into MIT. And he talked to you about why so many suburban kids were in the program and so few city kids."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Ramsey was a great guy who had been an MIT grad in 1951, when there were almost no blacks at MIT. And he was hopeful for better. He wanted what I think is the bigger and, in some ways, more important thing to occur in this MIT program when he took it over seven or eight years before Cedric got there. He wanted kids like Cedric, 50 kids like Cedric instead of one or two."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"And what he realized early on is that it would run into all manner of dilemmas that go right to the core of some of the problems with the notion of Affirmative Action. MIT sponsors the program. MIT wants as many of these kids as possible to eventually end up in their freshman class to make that freshman class look like a rainbow, as they say."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"And as people might mention, you can make the Ivy League, or any great college, look like a rainbow nowadays without ever having to go to the ghetto. You don\u0027t have to go there. There are plenty of middle and upper-middle-class black and Latino kids to fill those programs, kids who will eventually succeed at a top university. It\u0027s the other kids, kids like Cedric, for whom the distance is so vast to travel that for them, the failure rate is untenable for a place like MIT."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Just reading your account of it, it seems like part of his concern too was that kids would come in without any preparation, or without enough preparation, to go as fast as MIT would want them to go. And then MIT had no infrastructure to bring them up to speed. And so it was just setting them up for failure."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Absolutely. And they often have very big dreams, and they often come pushed forward by a whole community for whom they\u0027re the one who\u0027s going to make it. And that\u0027s a pretty heavy burden to carry to a place like MIT and then have all of that come crashing down on their head. Look, as Ramsey said, he said, look, the suicide rates up here are high enough as they are."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So Cedric, at the end of your time with MIT, you\u0027re informed that you weren\u0027t ready for MIT just yet. And you headed back to DC and put in a lot more work and a lot more effort. And after you graduated from high school, you end up at an Ivy League school, Brown University. And let me ask you to describe, first of all, who your roommate was and what he was like. What was his background?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"My roommate\u0027s name was Robert and he was from Marblehead, Massachusetts. And he was a white guy. He was cool. I think both his parents were doctors."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He went to private school."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"He went to a private school. What else? He had a sister that went to Harvard. But I think for the most part, we did get along. And I think that because we came from different backgrounds, that\u0027s where a little bit of the conflict came in. I think he came from a home where I think his mom pretty much waited on him hand and foot. And I came from a home where I was pretty much independent. I had to do things for myself, cook for myself, was for myself, those sorts of things, clean up behind myself."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"And one of the problems that we had was that he was at times, we were both messy at times, especially with me, especially when there was a lot of work. But for the most part, there were times when he would get really, really, really messy and outrageous and just be funky, so to speak."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This reminded me of when I\u0027ve been in Chicago high schools, how you\u0027ll see the white kids, the way they\u0027ll keep their clothes is they\u0027ll just dress like whatever and they\u0027ll look kind of bummy. Whereas the black kids, again, it\u0027s like everything always has to be neat and perfect. And even your clothes have to be just so perfect all the time. It\u0027s like they\u0027re from two different countries."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"This is true, but it\u0027s one thing if your clothes just look bad and then if your body just stinks. That\u0027s just a whole nother thing. And I think that sometimes he just was funky, man. And that\u0027s just not something that I wanted to put up with. And I wasn\u0027t willing to put up with that. There just was not much communication between us."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Ira, they just had utterly distinct ways of doing everything. Cedric\u0027s general heightened hygiene of having grown up in often squalid places, where Cedric was cleaning all the time. Cedric was always careful about how he looked and that he himself and his person was very clean. It was the opposite from Rob who never worried. This was just one of 1,000 things like that that immediately gripped the two of them in the room until the point where they almost came to blows."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And Cedric, there were times that you were really isolated there."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah, at Brown? Yeah. I think especially in the social arena. I grew up in church and everything. And just putting myself out there and getting involved, it went against some of what I was taught from church."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Can I ask, when\u0027s the first time you actually drank?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I\u0027ve never drank."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You still have never had a beer at college?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"No. Now, no."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"But the thing, Ira, if you go into Cedric\u0027s church and you go into Cedric\u0027s environment, the only reason Cedric has got where he got is because he didn\u0027t taste of any of the plates at the buffet table of adolescent life in Southeast. Most of those plates are poisoned."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Ron, let me ask you to read from page 197 in your book. At one point, you talk about just this clash of cultures."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"OK. \"Clearly, some East Andrews residents are spending serious time and energy having fun. Despite Brown\u0027s self consciousness about each student\u0027s individuality, the four preferred pastimes are the same here as they are at almost every other college-- drink beer, smoke pot, dance to deafening music until you drop, and on the rare occasion, get naked with some other warm body."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Possibly the best explanation why Cedric Jennings is in Brown\u0027s class of 1999 is that he managed to steer clear of the buffet table of adolescent experimentation, believing rightly, it turns out, that in his neighborhood, most of those dishes were poisoned. This was an extraordinary feat, considering how peer pressure at Ballou was backed up by violence. And the almost irresistible urge for teenagers to salve deep despair with sex, drugs, and music."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Cedric knows all this, just as he knows his resistance was made possible back when by his mother\u0027s fierce code. But eventually, something else took root. Cedric, needing to justify his monkish routine in high school night after night, developed a genuine belief that sacrifice, hard work, and extremely clean living would lead to rewards, including a scholarship to a top college. But now that he\u0027s made it, the guideposts are gone. And all around him, smart kids are getting high, getting drunk, and screwing. Even the real smart ones, kids who can eat Cedric\u0027s lunch in almost any subject."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"Sitting alone on his bed one Saturday night, there\u0027s a knock on the door, and a few kids from down the hall crowd in, rosy with anticipation of a night of some drinking, an off-campus party one of them has heard about, and then, who knows, maybe some late-night pizza. \u0027Hey Cedric, come on,\u0027 one of them says."},{"speakerName":"Ron Suskind","text":"\u0027Naw,\u0027 Cedric says, declining nicely, trying to show he appreciates their asking. \u0027I just don\u0027t do that kind of stuff.\u0027 And everyone nods meaningfully, though Cedric can tell they don\u0027t really understand. In a moment, they\u0027re gone. Just as well, he thinks, half-meaning it. I can\u0027t change now.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Cedric, in your view, do you feel like the biggest difference between yourself and the people who you were meeting at Brown, do you think it was racial, or do you think it had more to do with class?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I think it had more to do with class. I mean, obviously race. I was among a few minorities. But obviously class."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Explain that more."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Even within a minority community, most of my peers in the minority community had gone to private schools. They were pretty much from middle-class, upper-class homes. Mothers and fathers, who were both college educated in a lot of cases, were both living at home with them. It was just totally the opposite of where I had come from. And in a lot of ways, I just felt isolated all over again, like being at MIT."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you find in any way it was easier to be close to black kids from middle-class homes than it was to be close to white kids from middle-class homes?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"There actually was a difference?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah. We had more in common. We had more in common. We were working toward the same thing, pretty much."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s interesting thinking about this in terms of just the history of integration. Putting together this show, I was talking to one of my producers, and we were talking about how towards the end of Dr. King\u0027s life, one of the things that he looked at and started to think about was the question of OK, now under the law, blacks can go anywhere. But moving towards economic integration, moving people out of poor neighborhoods and up into the middle class seems so much more difficult. And reading the account of you at Brown trying to make that class jump just reiterates how hard it is."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"It\u0027s extremely hard. It\u0027s hard to see with my mother and everything. At first, I must admit I was a little ashamed of her coming to Brown because I knew that she was not like any of the other parents in terms of what we had. I mean, when I look back on it, I actually was ashamed because I knew that the other parents, they had a lot of advantages and they had things in life. And a lot of them had it easy. They got it easy."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"And my mother, we come from welfare. She\u0027s on welfare. She had dropped out of high school and gotten pregnant at an early age. And she got a GED. She wasn\u0027t college educated. So sometimes I was ashamed of the fact that my mother wasn\u0027t on the same level as the other parents."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Did you ever talk to her about that?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"No. Because I\u0027ve been ashamed to admit that to her. For a long time, I had been in denial about that. But I\u0027m not ashamed of her anymore. I\u0027ve grown out of that. I\u0027m proud of her, as a matter of fact. I\u0027m proud of her."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, yeah. I mean, look how far, look how much somebody had to push to make that happen."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"That counts more than a college degree."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you look at your situation now, you\u0027re finishing your junior year right now--"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Oh, it\u0027s finished."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s finished. OK. Sorry."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I\u0027m a senior, man. I\u0027m a senior."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you still feel like you\u0027re between worlds?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Oh, yeah. All the time. All the time. In one setting, the community where I come from, it\u0027s about not become white. And then at Brown, it\u0027s like not becoming-- yeah, it\u0027s the same thing, sort of. Not becoming white, remaining black in both worlds. Except it\u0027s sort of--"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But at Brown, it\u0027s like being black but in their world."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Being black but in their world. Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you feel like you\u0027re in this kind of no man\u0027s land?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Sometimes. Sometimes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Like when?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"This is difficult. It\u0027s hard. I\u0027ve never really given it a lot of thought. I don\u0027t know. I get a lot of grief when I come home, especially from people in my church, people in my community, about going off to this white man\u0027s land. And it\u0027s just, you shouldn\u0027t do it, they\u0027re going to eat you alive. I mean, I still get that sometimes. And it does isolate me at times. And yeah, sometimes I do, I feel alone. I guess that\u0027s what you asked me. Do I feel alone, isolated in terms of my decision of going to Brown, venturing out? Yeah, I do. I do feel alone."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you feel less alone, though it sounds like you\u0027re feeling more alone when you go back home to Southeast Washington? Do you feel less alone now when you\u0027re up at Brown? And in that world?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I do. Because I\u0027ve grown more comfortable with Brown."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In terms of feeling at ease in the new world that you have moved into, if we would consider somebody like your roommate Rob, who kind of grew up in that world, as being completely at ease, he\u0027s 100% at ease, where would you say your percentage is now?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"80%."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What\u0027s the 20% that still isn\u0027t there?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"I still have a lot of growing up to do. I\u0027ve come from Ballou High School, which is considered one of the worst high schools in DC. I\u0027ve gone off to one of the best universities in the country. And I\u0027m still not happy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When you say you\u0027re not happy, you mean you\u0027re not happy in a day-to-day way, or you\u0027re not happy with how far you\u0027ve come?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"A combination of both."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I mean, I guess I could imagine the day-to-day part of it because it just seem like it\u0027s so much work--"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"It is."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"--to keep things going."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"This is really difficult for me to talk about. So you\u0027ve got to bear with me here. Plus I haven\u0027t given this much thought. Success is a trip. Because we push people, especially blacks, to be successful, minorities to be successful. And then once they get there, and once we get there, for some reason, we pull each other back."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You\u0027re thinking specifically about things that are happening now that you\u0027re back home for the summer?"},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"Yeah. My biggest problems are at home. My biggest worries are at home. All these people who just bombard me with what they-- for some people, me going to Brown is like I\u0027ve given up, or turned my back to the fact that I\u0027m black, which is totally not the case."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And this is people who you respect saying this to you. People in your church."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"People that I respected. People that I thought were really behind me. That\u0027s the toughest part. And that\u0027s what\u0027s hard. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to deal with. Success is almost as worse as failure."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Ron Suskind\u0027s great, great book about Cedric Jennings is called A Hope in the Unseen. You know, before our interview ended, I told Cedric about the story in the first half of today\u0027s show, about a black who said that he would date but never marry a white woman."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"That\u0027s interesting because I think the same way. Somebody asked me, first they asked me, would you marry a white woman? And I said no. And they said, well, would you date a white woman? And I said, yeah, I would date a white woman."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The way the other guy on the show explains it, there\u0027s a part of him which doesn\u0027t believe that a white woman could completely understand him."},{"speakerName":"Cedric Jennings","text":"True, I guess. But I don\u0027t know. When two people bond in love, I think that they definitely understand things about each other, like more than what he\u0027s giving them credit for."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, our program was produced today by Nancy Updike and myself, with Alix Spiegel and Julie Snyder.
