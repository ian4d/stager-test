A father and a son go on a long car ride to figure out what parts of the father\u0027s brain have not been lost yet to Alzheimer\u0027s disease and to try to jump-start his memories. Act Two, My World Record, a hemophiliac\u0027s adventures at motocross racing and at setting another world\u0027s record. Act Three-- well, just stay tuned for Act Three.

I think one of the more amusing ones was the man who said he would go along in his wheelchair and he gets to a curb that the chair won\u0027t get up on. So he gets out of the chair, lifts it up on the curb, and then he gets back in and goes on his way. Or one woman wrote about she will dream that she\u0027s walking with her husband, and he\u0027s pushing her wheelchair. And then he sees somebody coming.

Why should it be in a hurry to show us the unpleasant side of life?

He says nobody really knows why. It might be chemical, or it might simply be that it\u0027s common for us all to see ourselves one way when in reality we\u0027re not that way at all."

I looked just like something someone-- wouldn\u0027t want to have sex with.",

And-- the intercourse was so quick, it just-- I hate to say it, but it was wham, bam, thank you ma\u0027am. And it-- wasn\u0027t as great as I thought it would be, but-- being naked in a bed with a woman who\u0027s being extremely friendly was the-- most fun I\u0027ve ever had. I think I\u0027d like to do it again.",

About a year after I last saw her, I just felt terribly depressed. I expected somehow that seeing the surrogate would change my life. I had started wearing cologne. And I thought everyone would be able to tell if I was sexy and handsome."

        "Some of them started seeing themselves as in wheelchairs or paralyzed-- whatever-- within a few months. Others it was years before it was incorporated. And I think almost all of them say it\u0027s inconsistent. Sometimes they will see themselves as in a wheelchair, the next time not. I think one of the more amusing ones was the man who said he would go along in his wheelchair and he gets to a curb that the chair won\u0027t get up on. So he gets out of the chair, lifts it up on the curb, and then he gets back in and goes on his way. Or one woman wrote about she will dream that she\u0027s walking with her husband, and he\u0027s pushing her wheelchair. And then he sees somebody coming. He says, \"Quick, get back in your wheelchair. People are coming.\"",
        "Yes. That comes through in a couple of the letters. And as I recall, one of the people wrote-- I guess I had raised the question, why doesn\u0027t the dreaming brain catch up and show you the reality? And she said, \"Why should it? Why should it be in a hurry to show us the unpleasant side of life? Maybe part of the function of dreams is to give us a few minutes of respite and happiness so we can come out of it and say, \u0027Hey, that felt pretty good.\u0027\""

            "Here\u0027s a letter that you were sent. An older man writes, \"I\u0027ve been in a wheelchair since October 6, 1966. And during the dream state, I\u0027ve never visualized myself in a wheelchair. I\u0027ve been impotent since 1962, but in dreams, I see myself as a stud that can go out with any of the cute, young things.\"",
            "One man, a wheelchair user, wrote, \"This is better than just a harmless fantasy. It means I can re-experience walking and running temporarily. I wake up mentally refreshed, at ease.\" Mr. Strommer was a college professor, and he spent some time researching why our subconscious minds would take so long to absorb the new facts about our lives, why his brain took a decade to admit to itself in dreams that he was blind. He says nobody really knows why. It might be chemical, or it might simply be that it\u0027s common for us all to see ourselves one way when in reality we\u0027re not that way at all."

            "Some of them started seeing themselves as in wheelchairs or paralyzed-- whatever-- within a few months. Others it was years before it was incorporated. And I think almost all of them say it\u0027s inconsistent. Sometimes they will see themselves as in a wheelchair, the next time not. I think one of the more amusing ones was the man who said he would go along in his wheelchair and he gets to a curb that the chair won\u0027t get up on. So he gets out of the chair, lifts it up on the curb, and then he gets back in and goes on his way. Or one woman wrote about she will dream that she\u0027s walking with her husband, and he\u0027s pushing her wheelchair. And then he sees somebody coming. He says, \"Quick, get back in your wheelchair. People are coming.\"",
            "Yes. That comes through in a couple of the letters. And as I recall, one of the people wrote-- I guess I had raised the question, why doesn\u0027t the dreaming brain catch up and show you the reality? And she said, \"Why should it? Why should it be in a hurry to show us the unpleasant side of life? Maybe part of the function of dreams is to give us a few minutes of respite and happiness so we can come out of it and say, \u0027Hey, that felt pretty good.\u0027\""

So he gets out of the chair, lifts it up on the curb, and then he gets back in and goes on his way.

            "Act One, Road Trip. Joel Meyerowitz is a photographer, grew up in New York City. But for the last two decades, his parents have lived in Florida. Joel would see them, visit for a few days at a time. But over the past 10 years, Joel\u0027s father, Hy, developed Alzheimer\u0027s. Before he retired, Hy was a salesman for 40 years and did a few years as a comic in a vaudeville act before that. He was a boxer, won his weight class in the very first Golden Gloves competition. But now that he had Alzheimer\u0027s, the doctor said that he should stay inside, avoid a lot of stimulation. His son Joel thought, \"What if we try, just for a brief time, something different?\"",
            "Joel Meyerowitz. His father Hy, his son Sasha. Their film has the working title The Mayor of the Block and is looking for a distributor. Coming up, people do what they shouldn\u0027t. In a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues.",
            "They got a camera and went on a three-week trip, driving from Ft. Lauderdale back to New York City. Joel Meyerowitz\u0027s son Sasha did most of the filming. You hear his voice only a few times in the footage I\u0027m about to play you. When they set out on the trip, Sasha was 27, Joel was 57, Hy was 87."

            "Does it bother you that you can\u0027t remember your kids\u0027 names sometimes and you can\u0027t remember what they do?",
            "Honestly, it\u0027s sad. I have a feeling of sadness, but I also have a feeling of acceptance. We\u0027ve been apart for 20 years in the mutual prime of our lives when I was raising my children and he was a grandparent. We weren\u0027t together.",
            "And so I guess I\u0027m just accepting of where he is. If we had been together for 20 years and I had seen the decline and I had been relating to him emotionally and lovingly all that time, I might feel a deeper sadness. But even though he\u0027s my father, the distance that we\u0027ve been apart all these years has put some kind of a buffer in there. So this is the guy that I know now.",
            "We have a much closer relationship, the way we see each other and talk to each other and have continuity.",
            "A hero fall.",
            "Well, he was my hero. My childhood hero. But that\u0027s so far away, I can\u0027t relate to the sadness of that. I love him in that unequivocal way that a child loves a parent. And I feel when I care for him a kind of renewal or a rebirth of feeling in this period.",
            "I know when I take him after a shower and I rub him down, I actually feel his head in my hands and I feel his flesh in my hands. It\u0027s been many years since I had that kind of contact with my father. And it was a little strange at first. I thought, \"What\u0027s it like to rub this other person\u0027s body? Touch this other person\u0027s body?\" It\u0027s like deference. And then I realize it\u0027s my Pop. And he\u0027s in need. He can\u0027t take care of himself this way.",
            "Mom? OK, here\u0027s Papa, Mom. Hold on. OK, here comes Dad.",
            "Wrong?",
            "I think my father had a classic marriage of his generation. He loved my mother. She was beautiful and hot tempered, an exciting person to be with. But he wanted something from her that either he didn\u0027t know how to get or she couldn\u0027t give. And that was a kind of mother-love that he himself hadn\u0027t experienced.",
            "His mother had been bed-ridden after his birth. And then she died soon after. So he never really knew her. That\u0027s the deepest groove in his memory, which is, I think, unrequited love.",
            "And I think from my point of view now that if he had really just loved my mother without demanding something from her, or needing something from her, which was that childhood need, that she probably would have just loved him back for the kind, warm, funny man that he was. But because there was something that he was demanding, she couldn\u0027t give it to him. A kind of perverse logic of relationship occurred.",
            "Why is she mad?",
            "Well, she probably was caring a lot--",
            "--which is why she was mad. That we didn\u0027t call.",
            "But you\u0027re having such a good time here.",
            "Throughout the trip, he asked for Sally every single day-- \"Where\u0027s Sally? Where\u0027s Mom?\"-- thinking that she should have been in the car next to him.",
            "Yeah, Pop. We said goodbye to Mom.",
            "It\u0027s your pillow. That pillow\u0027s going to have to be your Sally--",

            "Nope. That\u0027s your pillow, Pop.",
            "The swiftest!",
            "There was a time when we were driving with her in Florida, before we made the film. And she was sitting right next to him. And he leaned over to me and he said, \"Where\u0027s Mom?\" And I said, \"Well, who\u0027s sitting next to you?\" And he looked over at this person sitting next to him. He said, \"Where\u0027s Sally? That\u0027s not Sally.\"",
            "Good morning.",

            "The Permishic. Right.",
            "His real intelligence is to live in the moment. He knew where he was and he was just enjoying the experience. But he couldn\u0027t really look back at what he had done even an hour before and remember it. And I tested him all the time, because I wanted to see if stimulation could actually enliven his mentality and bring him back at all. But that was sort of a hopeless hope. But it didn\u0027t stop me from having it anyway.",
            "I just want to review a few things with you. I have a few questions for you.",
            "No.",

            "Read it one more time. At the end say, \"the Talmud.\" Because it says--",
            "It says it comes from the Talmud. \"Respect the old man who has forgotten what he has learned.\" Come to a rest. OK? Ready? Read.",

            "I was visiting my father. We were driving someplace and he was babbling on, as he does. His great skill is that he can talk. And in the middle of one of these riffs, he turned to me with a look of panic, really, and he said, \"The trouble with me is I never get to the point where I get to the point.\" And that was so pungent an observation about his predicament that it entered my consciousness in a way that made me say, now. That\u0027s it. I\u0027m going to make a film about him. He\u0027s at a place in this disease where, before he\u0027s completely gone and while he has some consciousness about his situation, I\u0027m going to take him out into the world again and see what happens to him and how he handles himself.",
            "Where were you born?",
            "Maybe so. One last time. This is it. This is your chance.",

            "Take 11 for Hy Meyerowitz reading from \"The Forgotten.\"",
            "Dad, this is-- no, no. Read that. No, no. This is a joke, Pop. Read those few words there. And then with the words \"the Talmud.\" Nice and slow, take this one.",
            "OK.",
            "I guess as a legitimate actor, you would have a hard time reading your lines. But as a comic actor, you can deliver your lines flawlessly--",
            "Well, it was East 100th Street, right?",
            "--without even having to read anything.",
            "Your career as a Talmudian actor--",
            "--is kaput! You\u0027re finished. Out! Next! Bring in the next old man.",
            "What was it that you liked about Charlie Chaplin that made you want to do the Charlie Chaplin act?",
            "Did you feel connected to him in that way?",
            "Aw--",
            "Oh, Papa. Well, your boys saw you. We all saw you. I loved when you were the strong man in the neighborhood. I loved when you were the Chaplin figure and the comic. I loved the way you drove the car. You were such a great driver.",
            "I love the way you talk to people. You could talk to the big guys or the little guys, and you made them all the same, Pop. I used to think of you as the great equalizer. You could take a guy who was a doctor or a principal of the school or a business man, and you can take another guy who was just an ordinary worker, and you would treat them the same. And you would bring them all to the same level, and that would be the level of laughter.",
            "That\u0027s right.",
            "He taught me all the street-smart things. He set up a punching bag for me. And he taught me how to fight, how to take my stance, how to throw a punch, how to put your body behind it. He had me work out on a light bag too, like this. He always felt that if you got into a scrape in the neighborhood that you shouldn\u0027t run away. His motto was, \"Step in and deliver the first blow.\" And he said, \"Take the biggest guy down.\"",
            "And that was his attitude. He wouldn\u0027t stop and run away from anything. On Morrison Avenue, the block we lived on, he was considered the mayor of the block. Anytime there was a dispute that had to be settled, they would actually come and ask him, \"What do you think, Hy?\" Or if there were strangers coming through the neighborhood and they needed to be told to get out of there, they\u0027d get him. And the scenes I remember of it, people would gather in front of our window, and they\u0027d yell, \"Hymie? Hey, Hymie?\" And he\u0027d come to the window and he would adjudicate from the window. He would say, \"No, no. You shouldn\u0027t do that. And he should do this. And you get that. Let him alone.\" And it was like The Judge.",
            "Hey, Pop?",
            "You know what this reminds me of?",
            "Does that remind you of Melvin?",
            "That\u0027s what I was thinking.",
            "Do you remember Melvin?",
            "What was Melvin?",
            "Do you know what ocean this is?",
            "A parakeet.",
            "Do you remember the things that Melvin said?",
            "Yeah, but how did he say it? Do you remember?",
            "No, he said, \"I\u0027m Melvin--\" what?",
            "\"I\u0027m Melvin Meyerowitz.\"",
            "Can you tell me the story of the time he got lost--",
            "Pop, remember how he used to say \"My name is Melvin Meyerowitz. I\u0027m a Jewish bird.\"",
            "That comes back to you?",
            "\"Good morning, Dr. Goldberg.\"",
            "The Catskills are mountains. This is an ocean. Which one?",
            "Whenever Dr. Goldberg came to visit Mom when she was sick?",
            "And do you remember the time the bird flew away across the Bronx? He went out the door on Mom\u0027s shoulder and he flew away. And we were all so heartbroken that the bird was gone. And then some woman called up. Do you remember? She called mom, and she said, \"Do you have a bird named Melvin?\" My mother said, \"Yeah, we have a bird. It was a green and yellow parakeet.\" And the woman said, \"Well, the bird landed on my window and said, \u0027My name is Melvin Meyerowitz. I\u0027m a Jewish bird.\u0027 And I looked you up in the phone book, and I called the Meyerowitz\u0027s, and they said, \u0027No, no. That\u0027s my brother Hy\u0027s bird.\u0027\" We went and we got the bird back. Do you remember that?",
            "I\u0027m surprised.",
            "With the onset of memory loss, it\u0027s not only his memories that are fading away, but it\u0027s the memories that I shared with him that are fading away. So I could no longer say to him, \"Hey Pop, remember we did this?\" And have him say, \"Yes, that was fantastic. Remember it?\" So I found myself progressively left alone with my memories. And then you look at your own memories and you realize, I got this handful of really insignificant things, and I\u0027ve made them my world, my world of memory.",
            "And it\u0027s astonishing how the few things that I recall to share with him are minor notes. The bird or the handful of things that I ask him. So that was really-- that was a lesson for me about what it is that rises up out of our experience that we hold onto.",
            "Pop.",
            "I want to ask you a few questions about the family.",
            "About our family.",

            "So you don\u0027t remember what Rick does?",
            "You\u0027re getting closer, Pop. Just try. Try to think about what Rick does.",

Joel would see them, visit for a few days at a time. But over the past 10 years, Joel\u0027s father, Hy, developed Alzheimer\u0027s. Before he retired, Hy was a salesman for 40 years and did a few years as a comic in a vaudeville act before that. He was a boxer, won his weight class in the very first Golden Gloves competition. But now that he had Alzheimer\u0027s, the doctor said that he should stay inside, avoid a lot of stimulation. His son Joel thought, \"What if we try, just for a brief time, something different?\""

I knew John would have to wear a plastic bag over his shunt arm to keep the dust out. We were lucky it rained. Dust usually billowed wildly after the start of a race, a huge rolling wave breaking over the hills and shrouding the spectators. Rain would keep the dirt moist and on the track.",

My mother worked frantically to reconnect the tube and to stabilize John\u0027s blood pressure. Later, I noticed that some of the blood had seeped inside a picture frame in the wall besides the dialysis chair. The frame held a photograph of John and me.

He\u0027s the subject of the documentary film Breathing Lessons by Jessica Yu. The film is remarkable because it\u0027s about a guy in an iron long, but it is completely unsentimental.
