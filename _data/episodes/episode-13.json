        "I just want to know, am I the last one to know about this? Because the first time I had sex without a condom was only a few months ago. I was dating this 21-year-old Irish boy with a creamy body and a big mouth. After the first time we skipped it, we never used a condom. At the time, I was living with my best friend, Sarah. She and I were sort of married and we told each other everything.",
        "One morning leaving my lovely boyfriend sprawled out and sleeping, I went next door to Sarah\u0027s room and sat down on her bed.",
        "So how\u0027s the sex? She smiled.",
        "Fun, I said. Not the greatest ever, but vigorous and sort of sweet. Pause.",
        "I wanted to tell her about the whole condom thing because I knew she was assuming we were using them, mistaking us every day for good, righteous people instead of the bad, irresponsible people we, in fact, were. And the longer it went on, the more it felt like I was lying.",
        "We\u0027re not using condoms, I blurted it out, looking down. There was a long pause.",
        "Josh and I aren\u0027t using them either, she said.",
        "I looked up. We stared at each other for a second and we burst out laughing. It may be hard to convey the strange giddiness of this moment to anyone who didn\u0027t go to college in the late \u002780s and early \u002790s. For Sarah and me, and for our girlfriends, safe sex was the marker of the modern, straight, post-AIDS feminist. She has sex with who she wants and when she wants, but she always protects herself. It was about self-respect and it was about being down with the cause. Sisters knew that sisters used condoms.",
        "Well, that was then. Here are some of the sisters now.",
        "Statistics seem to indicate that, in fact, very few women are practicing safe sex. Nationwide, only about 20% of currently sexually active women report using condoms. And one out of five of those condom-using women hadn\u0027t used one the last time they had intercourse.",
        "Gay men, in contrast, seem more careful. But even here, a San Francisco survey showed only half of gay men saying they use a condom every time they have sex.",
        "Interestingly, these studies, the most current according to the Centers for Disease Control, are four years old, and are based on data collected four years before that, at the height of my alleged safe sex vigilance and that of my friends. So what now seems clear is that a massive nationwide campaign to shape our sex lives failed. And no one is talking about the fact that it failed.",
        "Most of us are not practicing safe sex and never did. At least not in that every time, for the whole time, no exceptions way that safe sex as we knew it was all about. And now, nearly everyone I know seems paralyzed in this weird state that\u0027s part shame at what we see as laziness about using condoms, and part stubborn attachment to our secret decision not to use them as often as we feel we should.",
        "For instance, I started out scared about not using condoms with my cute Irish boyfriend and had to keep rationalizing what we were doing by reminding myself that he was a drunk, not a junkie. And that he\u0027d gotten head for a boy only once and hadn\u0027t liked it.",
        "But then fear faded to guilt, and now I don\u0027t even think the guilt makes sense. I\u0027m not using condoms and my women friends are not using condoms because when we look around, we are not dying of this disease, and neither is anyone we\u0027re sleeping with. And it\u0027s been that way for 10 years now. Heterosexual, non-drug-using women simply have not, as a group, become the much-feared second wave of the AIDS epidemic as we were always being warned in college that we would.",
        "Only 8% of all diagnosed AIDS cases in the United States are from heterosexual contact, according to the CDC. But we keep calling ourselves lazy, my friends and I, I think because we\u0027re feeling like bad feminists. Giving up safe sex means giving up that solidarity we believed in back when it seemed like we were all going to be at risk together-- gay men, straight women, women across lines of race, and class, and age, all of us united against a single, deadly common enemy.",
        "Five years later, I think it\u0027s only a matter of time before the phrase, \"No glove, no love\" sounds to us the way \"Sisterhood is powerful\" sounds to our mothers.",

        "And WBEZ is rebroadcasting my Friday night program, Your Radio Playhouse, right here, right now after Prairie Home Companion. And there\u0027s a little radio programming experiment. The idea is that since my program is radio storytelling plus music, it has some things in common with Prairie Home Companion, and might be the kind of thing that Garrison Keillor fans would enjoy. WBEZ is going to try this out for a few months and WBEZ management welcomes your thoughts and reactions to this programming idea.",
        "Your Radio Playhouse has been on the radio on Friday nights now for several months, and if you haven\u0027t heard it, the stories are told in a wide variety of styles by a wide variety of writers and performers. And some of the program just happens right here in the radio studio.",
        "For example, this week\u0027s program is about love. It\u0027s for the week of Valentine\u0027s Day. And we begin with this cassette-- I have it here-- that a friend sent me for the Valentine\u0027s Day holiday. This is \"A Guided Meditation For Singles\" presented by Frayda Kafka. And normally, if you\u0027re going to make something like this up, you actually would give the person-- you\u0027d make up a name like Frayda Kafka. But I\u0027m afraid this all too real. Frayda Kafka, produced by something called Conscious Singles Connection Incorporated, copyright 1994.",
        "And this cassette has lots of ideas for things that singles-- conscious singles, presumably-- can do so they don\u0027t feel bad on holidays like Valentine\u0027s Day.",
        "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s Your Radio Playhouse. I\u0027m Ira Glass. And you know, you didn\u0027t have to prepare in advance for this hour. We have prepared the whole thing for you. We have set the table. We\u0027ve lit the candles. It\u0027s all set. Oh, conscious singles. And couples, you couples who are sensitive to your consciously single friends. A very special hour for you, so stay with us.",
        "What\u0027s amazing about this tape to me is its utter lack of modesty about what it promises. It doesn\u0027t just promise to make you feel a little better about being single, it is categorical. It promises complete spiritual and emotional peace. When you\u0027re done listening to this cassette it says, \"You will be at peace with being single. You will feel happy. You will feel fulfilled.\"",
        "You know what could be easier? What could be easier?",
        "This isn\u0027t-- I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s not working for me. Are you breathing there at home? Are you? If you\u0027re in your car, are you breathing right now? And is it happening, are you finding peace?",
        "She also says this sentence, which I love.",
        "That is a sentence you never hear in the English language. Usually when people get into the construction and the rest is up to-- that\u0027s a pretty common construction in school, in sales situations, over the TV. You hear that a lot and people never go into the construction, and the rest is up to-- and end up with me. No, it\u0027s always you.",
        "She also says this other thing that I find mesmerizing, but incomprehensible. And it\u0027s this--",
        "What is that about? You know, she\u0027s in the tape business. It\u0027s not like a video thing, it\u0027s a cassette with sound.",
        "If at the beginning of our radio show we would say to you, hi, we\u0027ve been working really hard to prepare a really good show for you. And there\u0027s one other thing you\u0027ve got to know--",
        "Unless it was some sort of reverse psychology thing. You know what I mean? We\u0027ve used all the promotional tactics we could think of and now we\u0027re doing reverse psychology. We\u0027re doing reverse psychology and what we\u0027re saying is--",
        "Yeah, that will be the day. So side one of the tape is a kind of warm-up to the actual meditation, and side two is the guided meditation itself.",
        "And she has us relax, breathe deeply, which we have all been practicing earlier in the show. And then she says, pretend you\u0027re having a dream. And the dream she has us pretend is astonishingly banal. You pretend we\u0027re floating among clouds.",
        "If you had to pay for dreams, this is one you wouldn\u0027t even rent. You wouldn\u0027t even rent this one at the video store.",
        "So you float in the dream, and of course because all the elements have to be involved, there\u0027s air and there\u0027s clouds, and you float passed the mountain. And then you come, of course, to a river. And this is where she gets to the heart of the matter. Remember the promise of the tape is that she is going to make you feel good about your singlehood, and at peace with it. And how does she do it?",
        "It\u0027s really fascinating. She does it by having you imagine the person who you\u0027re meant to be with.",
        "In other words, the whole way that you\u0027re going to come to peace with your singlehood is you just envision the day when you\u0027re not single. That seems like kind of a cheat to me. That isn\u0027t being at peace with singlehood. That\u0027s simply believing that your singlehood is a temporarily delayed state that will lead to couplehood.",
        "What is that about? What is the bet that she\u0027s hedging there? Like, you know, who is she trying not to offend? Like, OK, we\u0027ve got the people who are involved with the males. We\u0027ve got the people involved with the females. And then, we just want to be sure like we get everybody in, the people who are involved with-- what, a horse?",
        "At this point in the tape, I have to say-- for me, anyway-- it kind of starts to work on me. I start to think, like yes, I do want this person who\u0027s going to hold me and be the person who totally understands me.",
        "And one of the things that\u0027s interesting to me about this is not just that it\u0027s so effective, but that it\u0027s such a lie. I mean, if you\u0027ve ever been in an actual relationship, no human being who you\u0027re going to be with is going to be there to touch you the way you want to be touched every time, and talk to you the way you want to be talked to every time.",
        "And the fact that this could be a comfort to someone, I think it\u0027s just a sign of how much we want this. You know, that we want this person.",
        "In the New Yorker magazine this week, John Updike writes about Lana Turner\u0027s seven husbands. He says, there\u0027s something ridiculous about a woman who take seven husbands. As if she had rummaged through the drawers of masculinity and come up with seven dwarfs.",
        "And I think that actually, what\u0027s ridiculous about it isn\u0027t that there was anything wrong with those seven guys that they were dwarfs. What\u0027s ridiculous is the notion that she could be married to seven different people and be happy with none of them. That she, herself, would not be able to find happiness with any of those guys.",

It doesn\u0027t just promise to make you feel a little better about being single, it is categorical. It promises complete spiritual and emotional peace.

Remember the promise of the tape is that she is going to make you feel good about your singlehood, and at peace with it. And how does she do it?",
        "And one of the things that\u0027s interesting to me about this is not just that it\u0027s so effective, but that it\u0027s such a lie. I mean, if you\u0027ve ever been in an actual relationship, no human being who you\u0027re going to be with is going to be there to touch you the way you want to be touched every time, and talk to you the way you want to be talked to every time.",

WBEZ is going to try this out for a few months and WBEZ management welcomes your thoughts and reactions to this programming idea.",

        "For example, this week\u0027s program is about love. It\u0027s for the week of Valentine\u0027s Day. And we begin with this cassette-- I have it here-- that a friend sent me for the Valentine\u0027s Day holiday. This is \"A Guided Meditation For Singles\" presented by Frayda Kafka. And normally, if you\u0027re going to make something like this up, you actually would give the person-- you\u0027d make up a name like Frayda Kafka. But I\u0027m afraid this all too real. Frayda Kafka, produced by something called Conscious Singles Connection Incorporated, copyright 1994.",
        "In other words, the whole way that you\u0027re going to come to peace with your singlehood is you just envision the day when you\u0027re not single. That seems like kind of a cheat to me. That isn\u0027t being at peace with singlehood. That\u0027s simply believing that your singlehood is a temporarily delayed state that will lead to couplehood."

        "He said, yes, looking anxious again. Then no, knowing he had said the wrong thing.",

        "We can talk on the phone, but we can\u0027t see each other, I said.",
        "I said, I\u0027m making a pile for a little animal to find and to use. And besides, the bark is so pretty.",
        "We walked aimlessly. It was hot. We looked for shade. He stopped at a bunch of rocks marking the gate in front of a white picket fence. He picked up one of the rocks with both hands. It was big and rough, salt and pepper with white spindly lines running through it. Some bits of sparkly dust glinted off it in the sun.",
        "I knew I would as well, but I wanted to say no to try it out. I gave in almost immediately. So we walked. I kicked stones watching my feet. There were trees on either side of us.",
        "Now he said, I like you so much. So very much. And I noticed he didn\u0027t say love.",

        "I said, what are you thinking?",
        "He said, can\u0027t we be friends?",
        "I said, upset. He nodded. I hated that he nodded. He knew it was going badly and he began to feel miserable. He tried to think of something to say.",

        "We sat on a mound of tall, reedy grass down from a tree. It was cooler.",
        "Do you want to turn around? I said.",
        "No, I said.",
        "I said stupid things. Or maybe it is that they weren\u0027t stupid, but saying them out loud sounded so stupid.",
        "What? I said.",
        "The look on his face picking up the rock, moving it, walking, it all made me so tired.",
        "He said, tall grass, and looked at me. His eyes were wide open.",
        "He just looked at me without expression, not sure of how he should look. He knew I would go for a walk. He knew I wanted to.",
        "He said, how do you feel?",
        "I said, we can\u0027t be friends. We can\u0027t. I can\u0027t. It\u0027s not what I want.",
        "He said, what are you doing?",
        "But when I said, then why? He couldn\u0027t answer.",
        "I smiled at him. He said things like that and I loved him. He lounged and I sat and picked up twigs and pushed them into the soft, moist ground, reaching for pieces of bark. Different mottled surfaces, rough, but warm and comforting in my hands. I placed them carefully between the twigs.",
        "He said, I\u0027m the one who\u0027s supposed to fix it, is that it?",
        "He said, what will we say? Hi, how are you? I\u0027m fine. That\u0027s all?",
        "I said, I don\u0027t understand you. We thought we were alike, but we find we are not. I hate when you say you\u0027re sorry you hurt my feelings. You didn\u0027t hurt my feelings, you hurt me. And you\u0027re dumb. Why are you doing this? I hate this conversation. I hate this kind of conversation.",
        "There, doesn\u0027t it look better now? He said. He looked satisfied, relieved at what he had done. I fought back irritation and wondered at what this meant to him. I guessed it was because he had done something. Sometimes just doing any one thing can make you feel better. It doesn\u0027t matter what.",
        "I said, well, you\u0027re the man. You\u0027re the one making it all wrong. You figure it out.",
        "After a while he said, how you feel now, this has happened to me before.",
        "He said, I hate this conversation too. I hate it so much.",
        "I don\u0027t know, I said.",

The idea is that since my program is radio storytelling plus music, it has some things in common with Prairie Home Companion, and might be the kind of thing that Garrison Keillor fans would enjoy. WBEZ is going to try this out for a few months and WBEZ management welcomes your thoughts and reactions to this programming idea.",
            "Your Radio Playhouse has been on the radio on Friday nights now for several months, and if you haven\u0027t heard it, the stories are told in a wide variety of styles by a wide variety of writers and performers. And some of the program just happens right here in the radio studio.",
            "For example, this week\u0027s program is about love. It\u0027s for the week of Valentine\u0027s Day. And we begin with this cassette-- I have it here-- that a friend sent me for the Valentine\u0027s Day holiday. This is \"A Guided Meditation For Singles\" presented by Frayda Kafka. And normally, if you\u0027re going to make something like this up, you actually would give the person-- you\u0027d make up a name like Frayda Kafka. But I\u0027m afraid this all too real. Frayda Kafka, produced by something called Conscious Singles Connection Incorporated, copyright 1994.",

We have prepared the whole thing for you. We have set the table. We\u0027ve lit the candles. It\u0027s all set. Oh, conscious singles. And couples, you couples who are sensitive to your consciously single friends. A very special hour for you, so stay with us.",
            "What\u0027s amazing about this tape to me is its utter lack of modesty about what it promises. It doesn\u0027t just promise to make you feel a little better about being single, it is categorical. It promises complete spiritual and emotional peace. When you\u0027re done listening to this cassette it says, \"You will be at peace with being single. You will feel happy. You will feel fulfilled.\"",
            "You know what could be easier? What could be easier?",
            "This isn\u0027t-- I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s not working for me. Are you breathing there at home? Are you? If you\u0027re in your car, are you breathing right now? And is it happening, are you finding peace?",
            "She also says this sentence, which I love.",
            "That is a sentence you never hear in the English language. Usually when people get into the construction and the rest is up to-- that\u0027s a pretty common construction in school, in sales situations, over the TV. You hear that a lot and people never go into the construction, and the rest is up to-- and end up with me. No, it\u0027s always you.",
            "She also says this other thing that I find mesmerizing, but incomprehensible. And it\u0027s this--",
            "What is that about? You know, she\u0027s in the tape business. It\u0027s not like a video thing, it\u0027s a cassette with sound.",
            "If at the beginning of our radio show we would say to you, hi, we\u0027ve been working really hard to prepare a really good show for you. And there\u0027s one other thing you\u0027ve got to know--",
            "Unless it was some sort of reverse psychology thing. You know what I mean? We\u0027ve used all the promotional tactics we could think of and now we\u0027re doing reverse psychology. We\u0027re doing reverse psychology and what we\u0027re saying is--",
            "Yeah, that will be the day. So side one of the tape is a kind of warm-up to the actual meditation, and side two is the guided meditation itself.",
            "And she has us relax, breathe deeply, which we have all been practicing earlier in the show. And then she says, pretend you\u0027re having a dream. And the dream she has us pretend is astonishingly banal. You pretend we\u0027re floating among clouds.",
            "If you had to pay for dreams, this is one you wouldn\u0027t even rent. You wouldn\u0027t even rent this one at the video store.",
            "So you float in the dream, and of course because all the elements have to be involved, there\u0027s air and there\u0027s clouds, and you float passed the mountain. And then you come, of course, to a river. And this is where she gets to the heart of the matter. Remember the promise of the tape is that she is going to make you feel good about your singlehood, and at peace with it. And how does she do it?",
            "It\u0027s really fascinating. She does it by having you imagine the person who you\u0027re meant to be with.",
            "In other words, the whole way that you\u0027re going to come to peace with your singlehood is you just envision the day when you\u0027re not single. That seems like kind of a cheat to me. That isn\u0027t being at peace with singlehood. That\u0027s simply believing that your singlehood is a temporarily delayed state that will lead to couplehood.",
            "What is that about? What is the bet that she\u0027s hedging there? Like, you know, who is she trying not to offend? Like, OK, we\u0027ve got the people who are involved with the males. We\u0027ve got the people involved with the females. And then, we just want to be sure like we get everybody in, the people who are involved with-- what, a horse?",
            "At this point in the tape, I have to say-- for me, anyway-- it kind of starts to work on me. I start to think, like yes, I do want this person who\u0027s going to hold me and be the person who totally understands me.",
            "And one of the things that\u0027s interesting to me about this is not just that it\u0027s so effective, but that it\u0027s such a lie. I mean, if you\u0027ve ever been in an actual relationship, no human being who you\u0027re going to be with is going to be there to touch you the way you want to be touched every time, and talk to you the way you want to be talked to every time.",
            "And the fact that this could be a comfort to someone, I think it\u0027s just a sign of how much we want this. You know, that we want this person.",
