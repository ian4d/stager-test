And we reached the former medical student, Arthur Davis, Junior, in his home in Indio, California, not far from Palm Springs. He practices family medicine. He actually makes house calls, he said, and has six kids of his own.

He persuaded her that she was imagining things, convinced her that there was no one else and could never be anyone else but her, all in that voice, that romantic, seductive, tempting voice that she had heard on the radio. Finally, after another one of their many fights, after months of continuous abuse, my mother took a gun and shot my father in the mouth."

He told them that he was teaching her to shoot when the gun went off. The cops didn\u0027t believe him, but he didn\u0027t want to press charges, and basically, there was nothing they could do. The strange thing is that, for a while, that whole experience brought them closer together. For a while."

        "It was interesting as we visited Aunt Menta and Uncle Wendall\u0027s this weekend. We just had a real nice time. But I felt a little odd about going and suggested in a very small way that Art ought to call Menta. But sometimes he gets real negative about my suggestions. And I realized that it\u0027s because many times I perhaps force myself on him. So I didn\u0027t say anything until about 50 miles before we got there.",
        "I really felt as though Menta should know we were coming. I should have written and told her. But I\u0027ve left the communication with his family to Daddy. Well, he got a little bit vexed, and jumped out of the car, and went to the telephone, saying, \"I hope you\u0027re satisfied now.\" But when he came back, Menta hadn\u0027t realized we were coming. And we were all grateful that we\u0027d made the telephone call even though I didn\u0027t want to be right and say, \"I told you so.\" Because it wouldn\u0027t have been nice to have walked in on them at a quarter to 10:00 at night.",
        "It was interesting how genuinely they accepted us. I don\u0027t know if I could be that gracious or not. Although they live such different lives. They had no plans for the weekend. We came. This was fine. And we ate what they had. And this was it.",
        "But I think of if the situation were reversed and Ment and Wendall dropped in on us, how many times we have company over the weekend, we have to go to functions, and we have music lessons, and things like this, and our lives are so completely different. It\u0027s interesting that we just spent all day sitting without doing anything at all. And this is so unusual for us. And even though I don\u0027t suppose I could do it every week, it did seem good for one week, just to sit, and look at each other, and talk. Ment and Wendall are sweet people really. It\u0027s very difficult for me not to judge a person\u0027s Christian experience.",
        "Darlene was voicing her experience last night. Art was a little bit perturbed because her skirt was too short. And Darlene was telling me that, really, she, in a way, resented Daddy\u0027s religion because it seemed to be so void of actual feeling and love. And I felt rather bad this morning. I got up to have my worship. I neglected it over the weekend.",
        "And I got up to have my worship. And as I did, Daddy came in and sat down beside me. And I felt rather funny because I really feel that he does this as a duty more than anything else. And when I have my worship, I feel communication with God, and I enjoy what I\u0027m reading. And when Daddy came in, there was just a-- I don\u0027t know. I suppose you\u0027d call it an inner resentment.",
        "I didn\u0027t know quite what to do. I was right in the middle of reading a chapter. So for the first time in my life, rather than to try to anticipate what he wanted and his needs, I just let him sit there. And I thought if he would say to me, \"Could I have worship with you?\" it would be fine. But he didn\u0027t. So I just continued reading and didn\u0027t say anything at all. He sat there for a little while, and then he left.",
        "I think that if Daddy feels a spiritual lack and feels a need, then he, himself, ought to be the aggressive one and fulfill this need in his own way.",
        "I would love to begin to have worship with Daddy, together, as husband and wife.",
        "We certainly have begun to enjoy many relationships that are very, very fulfilling in our marriage. But as far as this worship is concerned, it seems as though I\u0027m always the one that has to make the initiative, plunge and say, \"Well, come, have worship with me,\" and select things that are inspiring. And I think this is wrong.",
        "Hello, son. There isn\u0027t much news. Grace was over one day. And she was feeling so bad about her marital situation. So I gave her this reality therapy book.",
        "I was reading an article last week, where we, so many times, try to fit people into our own pattern rather than to understand their background and appreciate their own pattern. And I think that he ought to fulfill his spiritual needs in his own way.",
        "Because I don\u0027t really know the depths of his spirituality and his basic needs.",
        "So because I have no way of knowing, I\u0027m going to stop worrying.",
        "Daddy\u0027s calling, so bye-bye, son. And I\u0027ll see you later. I just had to tell you, son. Daddy screamed and hollered. You may have heard him over the tape, \"Honey!\" And I was right in the middle of a sentence to you, so I didn\u0027t go.",
        "But when I ran down, here, he has this power feed on. You know Daddy. He is very, very slow at what he does. And everyone has about lost their temper at him because they\u0027ve tried so hard to be patient. And day by day, they\u0027ve hoped this thing gets fixed.",
        "And so now I find this morning that he had fixed it. And this John that is working there was sitting there and working this just as easy as could be. And of course, everyone was really thrilled. And Daddy was so tickled. He was just as tickled as a little boy really.",
        "And by the way, I sent you one, son. You\u0027ll be getting it in the mail soon. I had it sent right direct to you. It isn\u0027t that I think you need it. It\u0027s just a new insight on mental health, mental illness, that I think is good.",
        "Well, son. I don\u0027t know who\u0027s talked.",
        "If I had the money, I would have called you tonight. It\u0027s funny. When you have an emotional problem, you don\u0027t quite know where to turn. They can say, \"Turn to the Lord.\" And I think this is true. And yet, we\u0027re so human. We want human help.",
        "I just come back from taking a walk this evening, thinking, \"If I could just talk with someone.\" And of course, you don\u0027t talk your problems out with too many people. And so I decided I\u0027d turn the tape recorder on. And you could hear a negative [CLEARS HER THROAT]-- I\u0027m trying to get a cold-- you could hear the negative side of the Davis household, which has been typical in the last few years.",
        "Here\u0027s Darlene. I could go on and on, and I know I must stop. Bye-bye, son.",
        "There\u0027s no excuse for this really other than that I can see for the first time she has money of her own. And it\u0027s the little things that she\u0027s bought. It seems good to just have money and spend it. And at the first of the year, she really probably didn\u0027t work quite as much as she should\u0027ve. Regardless of what\u0027s gone over the dam, she\u0027s left with a $500 bill now. And well, naturally, we brought the problem to Daddy.",
        "When Darlene found this out from Mrs. Hare, she came home and cried an hour while I was teaching music lessons. And after the lessons, I went up and found out what the problem was. Naturally, she realizes her mistake. She\u0027s defeated. She doesn\u0027t know which way to turn. And I explained this to Art last night that she had realized that she made mistakes.",
        "But goodness knows how many mistakes we\u0027ve made in life. And as parents, if we could just help her pick up the pieces and somehow put them together again, so she wouldn\u0027t feel defeated, this would be so much more rewarding. But I also told him that I felt that we hadn\u0027t really helped you children too much with your schooling and that it seemed to me, and I\u0027m sure you children felt the same way, that there were hundreds of dollars that goes into the basement. And I didn\u0027t really think it was right. Well, this he resented very much.",
        "I probably told you about the chapter I read to Jimmy when we were riding to Mrs. Lester\u0027s voice lesson. And it was a chapter on nagging. Smart wives don\u0027t have to nag. And it was so interesting. Halfway through it, I realized that this was written for me because I do nag quite a bit. And here, it brought out that sometimes a person nags because they want to feel superior.",
        "Each time they-- well, here, I\u0027ll read it, son. \"If you stop to think about it, you know perfectly well that this sort of nagging, that means nagging to get things done and things, isn\u0027t correcting the evil of what you complain. It\u0027s only making you feel important, virtuous, and superior. So for goodness sake, find some more constructive way of enhancing your feeling of virtue if it\u0027s so badly in need of being enhanced.\"",
        "Daddy has been very, very busy working in the basement. One of the machines is broken down. And true to form, it\u0027s taken him a long, long time to fix it. We\u0027re behind as usual on strips. Jack goofed, I guess, in his order of extrusions. And we are out of extrusions and won\u0027t be having them until Friday.",
        "I made $50 in one week and a half. That\u0027s when I bought-- I bought your suit, and paid my tithe, and things like this. Well, son, I\u0027ll say goodbye. But thank you for your words of advice as far as my resting. And thank you for being concerned about my welfare.",
        "I really have gotten along quite well recently. I didn\u0027t feel too bad of depression last month. Well, here I go. We\u0027ll see you again. And I\u0027ll let someone else talk on the tape. Bye-bye."

        "\"In me, it was fleeting and a traitor.\"",
        "\"It blemished what was glorious. But it was great because it was the first love.\"",
        "It was hearing my dad recite poems like this that made my mother fall in love with him. It was a poem called \"El Brindis del Bohemio\" about Bohemians toasting in the New Year that did her in.",
        "Describe it. What does it say?",
        "This is an old 45. It\u0027s my father. He was a pioneer in Spanish-language broadcasting here in Chicago, a radio announcer in the 1950s and \u002760s. My dad\u0027s not playing the guitar or singing on this record. He\u0027s reciting poetry. This is what he sounded like when I was little.",
        "I know what my mother was thinking when she heard this. Any man who can get so worked up about his mother had to be a special man. So she called the radio station. They talked on the telephone, went out, and, three months later, they were married.",
        "Now falling in love with the voice on the radio may sound a bit extreme, but consider this. My mother was 16, in Chicago for only a few months after having lived in Puerto Rico. It was her first time in the States. She barely spoke English and mostly stayed at home.",
        "I\u0027m not even going to bother translating this one. Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s very romantic about the perfection of a woman\u0027s eyes. And this man, the one you\u0027re hearing, I never knew him. Sure, I heard stories about his radio shows, how he would produce talent shows, and have live performances, and bring in crowds from all over the city. People would come to be part of live radio. Women wanted to hear him and his poetry.",
        "But by the time I was old enough to hear him on the radio, he was reading the news and not poetry. And what I remember were the fights between them, my mother and father, about how he was never home, always late, too busy for us. His life on the radio was all consuming. The very thing that brought my parents together drove them apart. And I had fights with him too.",
        "Once when I was 16, my dad came home after being away for a few days. And I asked him what he was working on that kept him away so much. It wasn\u0027t as if he was out of town. He just didn\u0027t come home. Well, he didn\u0027t appreciate it, got very indigent, and he beat me.",
        "Partly, he was defensive because he was seeing another woman. And partly, it was because of this culture clash. I was talking to him like an American girl, but he was born in Mexico. And in Spanish families, you never questioned your father. You never questioned your dad. In his mind, there was nothing more disrespectful than a child questioning the authority of her father.",
        "When my mother found out about the other woman, she couldn\u0027t believe it and didn\u0027t. He would tell her in that same beautiful voice that he still loved her. He persuaded her that she was imagining things, convinced her that there was no one else and could never be anyone else but her, all in that voice, that romantic, seductive, tempting voice that she had heard on the radio. Finally, after another one of their many fights, after months of continuous abuse, my mother took a gun and shot my father in the mouth.",
        "My dad survived the gunshot. And when the police came, he lied to them about what had happened, so they wouldn\u0027t take my mother to jail. He told them that he was teaching her to shoot when the gun went off. The cops didn\u0027t believe him, but he didn\u0027t want to press charges, and basically, there was nothing they could do. The strange thing is that, for a while, that whole experience brought them closer together. For a while.",
        "A couple of years ago, I decided to meet my father in Mexico. We were going to celebrate Father\u0027s Day together. I don\u0027t really know why we picked Father\u0027s Day. We both understood that being a father wasn\u0027t something he did very well. And when I think about it now, I can\u0027t remember a time in my life when I recognized that day. The point is that he didn\u0027t show up.",
        "It makes me sad because what I ended up doing was so much fun, and I knew he would have enjoyed himself too. I went to visit my uncle and cousins in Mexico City. We told stories, recited poetry, talked a lot about my dad. My cousin even brought out his guitar and tried to recite some of the poems my dad used to read. It was typical for my dad not to show up to things that included the family. Now that he\u0027s not really a part of it, it seems normal.",
        "My parents are divorced. My dad is in Texas, lonely and broke, dying of cancer. He\u0027s been out of radio for almost 20 years. When I talked to him on Monday and asked him about his poems, he couldn\u0027t remember the last time he had written one.",
        "I have a picture of my dad on a stage with the backdrop of a Spanish dancer and a big band surrounding him. There\u0027s a woman sharing the stage with him. She is elegant and stunning. She has this long, flowing evening dress. This woman is not my mother, but she captures my father. He\u0027s bowing at the waist. She holds out a hand to him, and he clasps it with both of his and kisses it, gazing up into her eyes with complete romantic concentration. His attention is for her alone.",
        "The king.",
        "Well, it\u0027s my dad\u0027s favorite song. And he sort of took it on as a theme for his life.",
        "\"I knew love.\"",
        "Well, it talks about a man who has no place. And regardless of where he finds himself, he continues to be the king.",

        "Yeah. \"You will say that you never loved me, but you will be very sad. And you\u0027ll be that way forever. With money or without money, I always do what I want. And my word is the law. I have no throne, or queen, or anyone who understands me, but I continue to be the king.\"",
        "Oh, yes. He sang this at parties, family gatherings, in the morning. He sang this all the time.",
        "Well, actually, Ira, that\u0027s not really true. I think that what\u0027s truer is that he really thinks he\u0027s king.",

            "It was interesting as we visited Aunt Menta and Uncle Wendall\u0027s this weekend. We just had a real nice time. But I felt a little odd about going and suggested in a very small way that Art ought to call Menta. But sometimes he gets real negative about my suggestions. And I realized that it\u0027s because many times I perhaps force myself on him. So I didn\u0027t say anything until about 50 miles before we got there.",
            "I really felt as though Menta should know we were coming. I should have written and told her. But I\u0027ve left the communication with his family to Daddy. Well, he got a little bit vexed, and jumped out of the car, and went to the telephone, saying, \"I hope you\u0027re satisfied now.\" But when he came back, Menta hadn\u0027t realized we were coming. And we were all grateful that we\u0027d made the telephone call even though I didn\u0027t want to be right and say, \"I told you so.\" Because it wouldn\u0027t have been nice to have walked in on them at a quarter to 10:00 at night.",
            "It was interesting how genuinely they accepted us. I don\u0027t know if I could be that gracious or not. Although they live such different lives. They had no plans for the weekend. We came. This was fine. And we ate what they had. And this was it.",
            "But I think of if the situation were reversed and Ment and Wendall dropped in on us, how many times we have company over the weekend, we have to go to functions, and we have music lessons, and things like this, and our lives are so completely different. It\u0027s interesting that we just spent all day sitting without doing anything at all. And this is so unusual for us. And even though I don\u0027t suppose I could do it every week, it did seem good for one week, just to sit, and look at each other, and talk. Ment and Wendall are sweet people really. It\u0027s very difficult for me not to judge a person\u0027s Christian experience.",
            "Darlene was voicing her experience last night. Art was a little bit perturbed because her skirt was too short. And Darlene was telling me that, really, she, in a way, resented Daddy\u0027s religion because it seemed to be so void of actual feeling and love. And I felt rather bad this morning. I got up to have my worship. I neglected it over the weekend.",
            "And I got up to have my worship. And as I did, Daddy came in and sat down beside me. And I felt rather funny because I really feel that he does this as a duty more than anything else. And when I have my worship, I feel communication with God, and I enjoy what I\u0027m reading. And when Daddy came in, there was just a-- I don\u0027t know. I suppose you\u0027d call it an inner resentment.",
            "I didn\u0027t know quite what to do. I was right in the middle of reading a chapter. So for the first time in my life, rather than to try to anticipate what he wanted and his needs, I just let him sit there. And I thought if he would say to me, \"Could I have worship with you?\" it would be fine. But he didn\u0027t. So I just continued reading and didn\u0027t say anything at all. He sat there for a little while, and then he left.",
            "I think that if Daddy feels a spiritual lack and feels a need, then he, himself, ought to be the aggressive one and fulfill this need in his own way.",
            "I would love to begin to have worship with Daddy, together, as husband and wife.",
            "We certainly have begun to enjoy many relationships that are very, very fulfilling in our marriage. But as far as this worship is concerned, it seems as though I\u0027m always the one that has to make the initiative, plunge and say, \"Well, come, have worship with me,\" and select things that are inspiring. And I think this is wrong.",
            "Hello, son. There isn\u0027t much news. Grace was over one day. And she was feeling so bad about her marital situation. So I gave her this reality therapy book.",
            "I was reading an article last week, where we, so many times, try to fit people into our own pattern rather than to understand their background and appreciate their own pattern. And I think that he ought to fulfill his spiritual needs in his own way.",
            "Because I don\u0027t really know the depths of his spirituality and his basic needs.",
            "So because I have no way of knowing, I\u0027m going to stop worrying.",
            "Daddy\u0027s calling, so bye-bye, son. And I\u0027ll see you later. I just had to tell you, son. Daddy screamed and hollered. You may have heard him over the tape, \"Honey!\" And I was right in the middle of a sentence to you, so I didn\u0027t go.",
            "But when I ran down, here, he has this power feed on. You know Daddy. He is very, very slow at what he does. And everyone has about lost their temper at him because they\u0027ve tried so hard to be patient. And day by day, they\u0027ve hoped this thing gets fixed.",
            "And so now I find this morning that he had fixed it. And this John that is working there was sitting there and working this just as easy as could be. And of course, everyone was really thrilled. And Daddy was so tickled. He was just as tickled as a little boy really.",
            "And by the way, I sent you one, son. You\u0027ll be getting it in the mail soon. I had it sent right direct to you. It isn\u0027t that I think you need it. It\u0027s just a new insight on mental health, mental illness, that I think is good.",
            "Well, son. I don\u0027t know who\u0027s talked.",
            "If I had the money, I would have called you tonight. It\u0027s funny. When you have an emotional problem, you don\u0027t quite know where to turn. They can say, \"Turn to the Lord.\" And I think this is true. And yet, we\u0027re so human. We want human help.",
            "I just come back from taking a walk this evening, thinking, \"If I could just talk with someone.\" And of course, you don\u0027t talk your problems out with too many people. And so I decided I\u0027d turn the tape recorder on. And you could hear a negative [CLEARS HER THROAT]-- I\u0027m trying to get a cold-- you could hear the negative side of the Davis household, which has been typical in the last few years.",
            "Here\u0027s Darlene. I could go on and on, and I know I must stop. Bye-bye, son.",
            "There\u0027s no excuse for this really other than that I can see for the first time she has money of her own. And it\u0027s the little things that she\u0027s bought. It seems good to just have money and spend it. And at the first of the year, she really probably didn\u0027t work quite as much as she should\u0027ve. Regardless of what\u0027s gone over the dam, she\u0027s left with a $500 bill now. And well, naturally, we brought the problem to Daddy.",
            "When Darlene found this out from Mrs. Hare, she came home and cried an hour while I was teaching music lessons. And after the lessons, I went up and found out what the problem was. Naturally, she realizes her mistake. She\u0027s defeated. She doesn\u0027t know which way to turn. And I explained this to Art last night that she had realized that she made mistakes.",
            "But goodness knows how many mistakes we\u0027ve made in life. And as parents, if we could just help her pick up the pieces and somehow put them together again, so she wouldn\u0027t feel defeated, this would be so much more rewarding. But I also told him that I felt that we hadn\u0027t really helped you children too much with your schooling and that it seemed to me, and I\u0027m sure you children felt the same way, that there were hundreds of dollars that goes into the basement. And I didn\u0027t really think it was right. Well, this he resented very much.",
            "I probably told you about the chapter I read to Jimmy when we were riding to Mrs. Lester\u0027s voice lesson. And it was a chapter on nagging. Smart wives don\u0027t have to nag. And it was so interesting. Halfway through it, I realized that this was written for me because I do nag quite a bit. And here, it brought out that sometimes a person nags because they want to feel superior.",
            "Each time they-- well, here, I\u0027ll read it, son. \"If you stop to think about it, you know perfectly well that this sort of nagging, that means nagging to get things done and things, isn\u0027t correcting the evil of what you complain. It\u0027s only making you feel important, virtuous, and superior. So for goodness sake, find some more constructive way of enhancing your feeling of virtue if it\u0027s so badly in need of being enhanced.\"",
            "Daddy has been very, very busy working in the basement. One of the machines is broken down. And true to form, it\u0027s taken him a long, long time to fix it. We\u0027re behind as usual on strips. Jack goofed, I guess, in his order of extrusions. And we are out of extrusions and won\u0027t be having them until Friday.",
            "I made $50 in one week and a half. That\u0027s when I bought-- I bought your suit, and paid my tithe, and things like this. Well, son, I\u0027ll say goodbye. But thank you for your words of advice as far as my resting. And thank you for being concerned about my welfare.",
            "I really have gotten along quite well recently. I didn\u0027t feel too bad of depression last month. Well, here I go. We\u0027ll see you again. And I\u0027ll let someone else talk on the tape. Bye-bye."

            "Act One, Berrien Springs, Michigan. The tape that Joe Silovsky found is from 1967. It came in one of those boxes. I don\u0027t know if you remember these boxes that reel-to-reel tape came in in the \u002760s, and \u002770s, and \u002780s. And it fits two hours of tape. It\u0027s not that big. It\u0027s nine-inch reel of tape, two hours of tape.",
            "And the box had stamps all over it, and addresses written, and crossed out, and written. And what it was was a letter on tape between this family in Michigan, the Davis family, and their son, Arthur, Junior, who was in medical school in Loma Linda, California. And the tape is interesting because it documents pretty thoroughly life in this one American family.",
            "Well, Alix Spiegel, on our radio staff, did a few days of detective work and tracked down the Davis family, who mailed this tape to their son in medical school in the late 1960s. And we reached the former medical student, Arthur Davis, Junior, in his home in Indio, California, not far from Palm Springs. He practices family medicine. He actually makes house calls, he said, and has six kids of his own. And he told us that these letters on tape went back and forth between him and his parents for a period of about four years when he was away in California in medical school.",
            "He said, no, he hadn\u0027t heard one since the 1960s. He said, no, he had no idea how one could end up in a thrift store in Chicago. No, he said, his parents were not still alive. His mother died 12 years ago, and his father died 4 years ago.",
            "We sent him uncut tapes of everything that was on the tape. And he heard them. And he said that it was fine with him for us to play the tapes on the radio. He said that the tapes captured the dynamics of his family perfectly. The drama of a lot of American families is the emotional distance of the father, the father staying away from the family orbit, the father not being around, the father holding himself apart. And Arthur Davis, Junior says that his father was like a lot of American dads in that way and was, in fact, pretty removed.",
            "Arthur Davis, Junior. Coming up, more old tapes, more about fathers in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues."

I didn\u0027t realize I couldn\u0027t take my test for this.",

            "Things are surely busy around here. They\u0027re really popping. I didn\u0027t get to bed \u0027til after 1 o\u0027clock though. I was working downstairs, and I had work ready to take up to Jack\u0027s today, so we can get paid. We don\u0027t have any strips right now though. I guess I got a call for supper, so I\u0027ll come back later.",
            "I heard a little story that I thought I would tell you, Joe. Mom reminded me at the supper table. I just got back from eating supper. There were a couple out. They were getting acquainted, shall we say, doing a little French kissing. And the fella said, \"Oh, I think I got your gum.\" And she said, \"No.\" She said, \"I got a bad cold.\" So I\u0027ll leave you with that little thought for the time being.",
            "Hi, Joe. I just got through talking to you on the phone. Little Kenny [? Jacques, ?] who I don\u0027t know if you remember him or not, but he\u0027s Quint [? Jacques\u0027s ?] oldest son, got married last March. And his girlfriend was here in school. And they were intending to keep it quiet until after school was out, but I guess he\u0027s pregnant now. So I suppose when you fool around, and do things like that, why, I suppose that\u0027s the price you\u0027re prepared to take. But I guess he\u0027s still in the Army.",
            "I saw him tonight in the drive-in. They look real happy together. She seems like a real nice little girl, almost too nice for him. He\u0027s a real nice fella, but he\u0027s quite mentally retarded, I think. At least, he may not be mentally retarded, but he has an awful time in school trying to figure out his ABC\u0027s. Anyway, that\u0027s the way it goes.",
            "And she seems to be real happy with him. She went with Carl Hamel before. And she seems like a good Christian girl. She\u0027s got one hand that\u0027s deformed. I suppose that makes her feel like it\u0027d be awfully for her to get anybody. So she probably thought she\u0027d take whatever she could get.",
            "Hi, Joe. That was sure nice to hear from you the other night. What I wanted to talk to you about tonight was I wanted to tell you about our power feed. This power feed that I made, we got that going now. So I got a hydraulic cylinder from Bimba, put that on there, and put some microswitches on there. And as the thing goes up, it pulls the chain around the sprocket.",
            "So put that sprocket on there. And as the cylinder goes in, it pulls the chain that goes around the sprocket, it pulls it up and pushes the drill down.",
            "And then when it gets to the other microswitch, why, it comes back. And as it comes back, we\u0027ve got weights on the other side of the sprocket, pulling the chain in the other direction.",
            "And this new compressor works like a dream. It really is doing a good job for us, which makes us very happy. We\u0027re real happy with the results we\u0027re getting so far.",
            "Ken is going to come over. Ken Scholski. I don\u0027t know whether you know him or not. But he does real good at drilling the big holes. So he\u0027s going to come over and drill a couple hundred of the strips with the big holes for us. So we can at least get into production again by tomorrow night.",
            "This one is practically foolproof, as long as we don\u0027t put too much air pressure on it and drive it too hard.",
            "We\u0027ve been drilling some extrusions, 18-inch extrusions on the press with two holes at a time. It\u0027s been going pretty good.",

            "Mom said she thought I ought to help her on this bill. But I don\u0027t know whether I\u0027m wrong in this situation or not, but I feel in a way that she had this coming because she hasn\u0027t put in her full time. This last month she has. But up until that time, she\u0027s agreed for 12 hours a week, and it\u0027s been usually around-- oh, I imagine 5 to 6 hours is a lot closer to what\u0027s actually been accomplished. And then the money she does get, she\u0027s been spending on so many incidentals. And I kept talking and talking, but it didn\u0027t seem to do much good.",
            "But I feel it\u0027s better to provide a way for children to earn their education than it is to actually give them the money. And besides, we don\u0027t have the money. And if we weren\u0027t working down in the basement, why, there wouldn\u0027t be any money any more than there is right now. In fact, there wouldn\u0027t be as much. So I don\u0027t know.",
            "I guess I get mixed up in my philosophy and my thinking sometimes. And I know Darlene sometimes resents the fact that we don\u0027t give her more money. She sees all these other folks getting money, and she doesn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know exactly what to do about the situation. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s really right and what\u0027s wrong.",
            "But right now, I\u0027m pretty strapped with all the taxes. I just had to pay $400 out at the first of the month. And now I come here again in the middle of the month and have to pay another $200.",
            "Well, anyway, be that as it may, Rich told a story he was told about a little mama mouse that lived on the-- oh, there goes-- the thing is running downstairs now. I can hear it clicking-- told about a little girl mouse that lived on one side of the corn field. And the little boy mouse lived on the other side of the field. And one day, the little girl mouse in the autumn made a trip across the field. And when she got to the little boy\u0027s house, she said, \"Help, help, I\u0027ve been reaped. I\u0027ve been reaped.\" They were reaping the corn.",
            "And old Darlene just laughed and laughed. But she couldn\u0027t figure out what she was laughing at. The more she talked, the worse it got. She couldn\u0027t get the connection to the whole thing. See, she said, she thought it had something to do with emptying garbage or something. I don\u0027t remember just what her statement was. Anyway, it really made it quite funny. Her naiveness made it funnier than ever.",
            "I\u0027m going to quit for now. I\u0027ve got some big holes to drill downstairs. And tonight\u0027s Fugitive night. I haven\u0027t watched Fugitive for so many months, I don\u0027t know whether he\u0027s still afoot or horseback. So well, anyway, so much for that. It\u0027s really been nice to talk to you.",
            "And I want to leave you with one really profound statement that the more you drill on these castings, the lighter they get. I want you to be sure if you don\u0027t remember anything else that you remember that. So son, we love you. We\u0027ll see you.",

            "Well, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and performers to tackle that theme with radio monologues, original reporting, memoirs, short fiction, anything they can think of. Today\u0027s program, Accidental Documentaries. Stories made from old tapes that have been sitting in basements, and attics, and thrift stores for decades. We have arrived at Act Two of our program, Baltimore.",
            "When you were doing radio, what did you like about it? What was the appeal of it for you?",
            "You\u0027re a good announcer. I didn\u0027t really know that. I\u0027ve been listening to the way that you do the announcements. You\u0027re relaxed, and yet, you punch the main points. But you sound completely at ease, and you\u0027re convincing. You\u0027re doing ads for the hokiest products in the world, and you sound completely like you believe it.",
            "There\u0027s a lot of appliances. And then there\u0027s one reader and adviser named Mrs. K.",
            "Formerly of Europe.",
            "A lot of what it\u0027s like to be on the radio is just trying to sound relaxed when you\u0027re not. You\u0027re doing a show. You\u0027re not just talking to people. And in some of these tapes, I can actually hear my father struggling to sound relaxed. And these recordings give me this picture of him that I have never had in my life really. He seems so young and innocent. A guy in his 20s, doing this thing that I know so intimately myself, just sitting in front of a microphone trying to sound at ease, trying to sound like this relaxed old pro, not a care in the world.",
            "This is just how long ago this happened. They had not yet invented the idea of renaming the colors of appliances, things like avocado, lemon, eggshell.",
            "Not long after he got out of the Army, my dad decided that radio was no way to make a living. And after a series of jobs, he decided to become a Certified Public Accountant. He was a typical workaholic, suburban dad. Off to the office at 7:00 in the morning. Back at 6:30 for dinner. Exhausted after that, he would sit in his yellow recliner in front of the TV and fall asleep. He started his own business, struggled to establish it, worked lots of nights and weekends. During tax season, from January to April 15, we would barely see him.",
            "In our house when I was growing up was an old reel-to-reel tape recorder, a little consumer unit, that my mother and my sisters and I would goof around on from time to time, record us singing or telling stories. And while my mom appears on these tapes a lot, my father does not appear on them once. He simply was not there to be recorded. The only time he\u0027s mentioned on all of these tapes is this. I\u0027m going to play this moment to you. My mother is cooing to my older sister, Randi, who\u0027s probably-- I don\u0027t know-- a year old, a year and a half old.",
            "I\u0027m just going to stop this tape right there. I have three things to say about this tape. Number one, formally of Europe? Number two, of course, no appointment is necessary. She already knows you\u0027re coming. And number three, this is my father in 1956, three years before I was born. He\u0027s 23 years old.",
            "Barry\u0027s my dad.",
            "These days, my dad explains his decision to leave radio and become an accountant this way.",
            "And that was 1959?",
            "The year I was born?",
            "Are those two things related?",
            "It sounds like they are.",
            "Now the way a story like this usually ends is that I reveal that this is why I\u0027m in radio, to make good on my father\u0027s legacy, to live the dream that he never got to live. But I have to say, the fact is, I never knew him as a radio deejay. I did not know that he had ever done radio the entire time I grew up. It was never discussed. The recordings of him doing this stuff were packed away in the basement. Nobody talked about it. I never thought of him as somebody who did anything but certified public accounting. If my mom ever mentioned this, I do not remember it.",
            "My father started in radio when he was 19, the same age I was when I started. He began at the college station at the University of Maryland, and, after graduation, got a job spinning records at a commercial station in Baltimore. Then he was drafted. And at the time of this particular recording, my father was actually in the Army, stationed in Virginia. But he wanted a career in radio so badly that every Sunday morning, at the break of dawn, he would leave his wife and his five-month-old baby, my older sister, and drive up to Baltimore to do a four-hour program.",
            "And I certainly didn\u0027t grow up with any special feeling about radio. I could care less about radio. Like most Americans, my medium of choice was television. I got my first job with National Public Radio in Washington when I was 19 years old. And at that point, I simply wanted a job in the media. I was a freshman in college. If an ad agency had hired me that summer, right now, I would probably be doing Bud Light commercials. I can just see the whole thing laying out that way.",
            "And in 1978, when I started working at NPR, my parents absolutely did not want me to do it. It wasn\u0027t even a judgment call. They were completely against it for the next, I want to say, 10 years, maybe it was 15 years really. They simply saw it the way most parents would. They saw it as impractical. They worried that I would never make any decent money, never be able to support a family, essentially, the reasons that my father quit radio.",
            "When I first dug out these tapes of my father, about a year ago, I asked my dad if he ever wished he could still do radio. And he was completely unenthusiastic about the idea. In all my life, I had only seen his desire to be on the radio once. And this was actually a couple years ago. I was filling in as the guest host of Talk of the Nation, this daily call-in show NPR does out of Washington. I was doing that for half a year. And my father had never seen me host a radio show.",
            "And he and my mom drove down to Washington from Baltimore to watch me do the show. And before the show, he asked me if he could read the news. And at first, I thought he was joking. And I don\u0027t remember exactly what I said, but I joked something back at him. And then later, as we got closer to going on the air, he asked again that he would like to read the newscast, the NPR newscast at the top of the hour, at the beginning of the show. And I realized he was serious. And I had to explain to him that I didn\u0027t have any authority over that, that the NPR newscasters, they wrote their own news, and they delivered it themselves.",
            "Since then I\u0027ve had him on our show a few times, on this show, including as an announcer, co-hosting a Father\u0027s Day show. He\u0027s coming around, I think. Lately, he\u0027s started saying that maybe I did not make such a mistake going into radio, that it seemed to be working out OK, which I\u0027m glad for. I think one of the hardest things for any parent is to have one set of expectations for their children, and then be forced by their children to change them. That\u0027s really hard. I can\u0027t imagine what it would be like to see your kid doing something that you, yourself, decided wasn\u0027t worth doing.",
            "My dad\u0027s paycheck for this four-hour Sunday morning program was $5.88. The most he ever made at a radio job was $90 a week.",

            "It was hearing my dad recite poems like this that made my mother fall in love with him. It was a poem called \"El Brindis del Bohemio\" about Bohemians toasting in the New Year that did her in.",
            "Describe it. What does it say?",
            "This is an old 45. It\u0027s my father. He was a pioneer in Spanish-language broadcasting here in Chicago, a radio announcer in the 1950s and \u002760s. My dad\u0027s not playing the guitar or singing on this record. He\u0027s reciting poetry. This is what he sounded like when I was little.",
            "I know what my mother was thinking when she heard this. Any man who can get so worked up about his mother had to be a special man. So she called the radio station. They talked on the telephone, went out, and, three months later, they were married.",
            "Now falling in love with the voice on the radio may sound a bit extreme, but consider this. My mother was 16, in Chicago for only a few months after having lived in Puerto Rico. It was her first time in the States. She barely spoke English and mostly stayed at home.",
            "I\u0027m not even going to bother translating this one. Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s very romantic about the perfection of a woman\u0027s eyes. And this man, the one you\u0027re hearing, I never knew him. Sure, I heard stories about his radio shows, how he would produce talent shows, and have live performances, and bring in crowds from all over the city. People would come to be part of live radio. Women wanted to hear him and his poetry.",
            "But by the time I was old enough to hear him on the radio, he was reading the news and not poetry. And what I remember were the fights between them, my mother and father, about how he was never home, always late, too busy for us. His life on the radio was all consuming. The very thing that brought my parents together drove them apart. And I had fights with him too.",
            "Once when I was 16, my dad came home after being away for a few days. And I asked him what he was working on that kept him away so much. It wasn\u0027t as if he was out of town. He just didn\u0027t come home. Well, he didn\u0027t appreciate it, got very indigent, and he beat me.",
            "Partly, he was defensive because he was seeing another woman. And partly, it was because of this culture clash. I was talking to him like an American girl, but he was born in Mexico. And in Spanish families, you never questioned your father. You never questioned your dad. In his mind, there was nothing more disrespectful than a child questioning the authority of her father.",
            "When my mother found out about the other woman, she couldn\u0027t believe it and didn\u0027t. He would tell her in that same beautiful voice that he still loved her. He persuaded her that she was imagining things, convinced her that there was no one else and could never be anyone else but her, all in that voice, that romantic, seductive, tempting voice that she had heard on the radio. Finally, after another one of their many fights, after months of continuous abuse, my mother took a gun and shot my father in the mouth.",
            "My dad survived the gunshot. And when the police came, he lied to them about what had happened, so they wouldn\u0027t take my mother to jail. He told them that he was teaching her to shoot when the gun went off. The cops didn\u0027t believe him, but he didn\u0027t want to press charges, and basically, there was nothing they could do. The strange thing is that, for a while, that whole experience brought them closer together. For a while.",
            "A couple of years ago, I decided to meet my father in Mexico. We were going to celebrate Father\u0027s Day together. I don\u0027t really know why we picked Father\u0027s Day. We both understood that being a father wasn\u0027t something he did very well. And when I think about it now, I can\u0027t remember a time in my life when I recognized that day. The point is that he didn\u0027t show up.",
            "It makes me sad because what I ended up doing was so much fun, and I knew he would have enjoyed himself too. I went to visit my uncle and cousins in Mexico City. We told stories, recited poetry, talked a lot about my dad. My cousin even brought out his guitar and tried to recite some of the poems my dad used to read. It was typical for my dad not to show up to things that included the family. Now that he\u0027s not really a part of it, it seems normal.",
            "My parents are divorced. My dad is in Texas, lonely and broke, dying of cancer. He\u0027s been out of radio for almost 20 years. When I talked to him on Monday and asked him about his poems, he couldn\u0027t remember the last time he had written one.",
            "I have a picture of my dad on a stage with the backdrop of a Spanish dancer and a big band surrounding him. There\u0027s a woman sharing the stage with him. She is elegant and stunning. She has this long, flowing evening dress. This woman is not my mother, but she captures my father. He\u0027s bowing at the waist. She holds out a hand to him, and he clasps it with both of his and kisses it, gazing up into her eyes with complete romantic concentration. His attention is for her alone.",
            "The king.",
            "Well, it\u0027s my dad\u0027s favorite song. And he sort of took it on as a theme for his life.",
            "\"I knew love.\"",

            "Yeah. \"You will say that you never loved me, but you will be very sad. And you\u0027ll be that way forever. With money or without money, I always do what I want. And my word is the law. I have no throne, or queen, or anyone who understands me, but I continue to be the king.\"",
            "Oh, yes. He sang this at parties, family gatherings, in the morning. He sang this all the time.",
            "Well, actually, Ira, that\u0027s not really true. I think that what\u0027s truer is that he really thinks he\u0027s king.",
