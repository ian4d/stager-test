When Julia Sweeney\u0027s brother got cancer, and then she got cancer, she decided she wanted to talk about it with strangers from a stage in a comedy club. After the worst of all these times was over, she turned some of these stories into a one-woman show, which became a book and a movie."

      "text": "But there\u0027s something about these original recordings that she made. During the same weeks that some of the most horrible things that can happen to a person were happening to her, there\u0027s something about these recordings which is just very remarkable. Her feelings are right there on the surface."

      "speakerName": "Ira Glass",
      "text": "There\u0027s this saying that comedy equals tragedy plus time, which isn\u0027t always true but is mostly true. And in this case, there is just no time, right? Sometimes you get the feeling when you hear these recordings that she\u0027s talking about these things for the very first time with anybody. And it\u0027s from a stage."

This, of course, is your weekly program documenting everyday life in these United States through whatever means and tactics seem necessary. And of course, most weeks, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme, documentaries, monologues, found tapes, occasional radio plays, anything we can think of."

      "text": "But today, what we\u0027re going to do is devote the entire program to just one thing, to this very unusual set of comic monologues. Today show\u0027s is going to proceed in two acts. Act One, Julia\u0027s Brother Gets Cancer. Act Two, Julia is diagnosed with cancer herself and gets treated. These recordings were made between October of 1994 and August of 1995 at a regular weekly comedy show called Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles, run by Beth Lapides and Greg Miller."
    },
    {
      "speakerName": "Ira Glass",
      "text": "Un-Cabaret started off as this kind of experiment in reaction to the predictability and lowest-common-denominator mentality of a lot of stand-up comedy. The rules of Un-Cabaret were that no comic was allowed to tell a story that he or she had ever told on stage before. So spontaneity was just built into the structure of it. And the way it would work is that every Sunday night, back in its early days, five or six people would go up, often with notes in their hands, onto the stage, and then do this thing that was somewhere between traditional stand-up and diary and a kind of reportage. It had its own very particular kind of feeling to it."
    },
    {
      "speakerName": "Ira Glass",
      "text": "Some quick caveats before we begin. These tapes are made from the soundboard at Un-Cabaret. And so the sound quality isn\u0027t always the greatest. Also, sometimes you\u0027re going to hear laughing and off-stage comments during the monologues. And these are from the MC and ringmaster at Un-Cabaret, Beth Lapides."

She\u0027s best known for a character named Pat. And the joke with Pat was that nobody could ever tell if Pat was a man or a woman. And there was a Pat movie, which, as she refers to, didn\u0027t really do too well."

      "text": "So to these tapes. This first bit is from October 23, 1994. And you know how part of being sick is dealing with everybody in your life when you\u0027re sick? A lot of the stories that Julia Sweeney tells about cancer are basically just stories about her family. Her brother moved in with her when he got cancer to be near the cancer treatment center very early in his illness. And then her parents moved in soon after that."

And then my brother, who is now living with me also, he gives himself shots every day for his blood counts. And so there\u0027s just syringes hanging around my house. And so a common thing for me is like, \"OK, who left their syringes on the kitchen table? Dad? We have to throw them away and break the needle.\" All right."

So the doctors come in. And my dad\u0027s reading about the plague in India, because that\u0027s a good diversion. And my mom is looking at the doctors and saying, \"Now, he looks single.\" And this doctor comes in, and he says, \"Michael, we can\u0027t get into your spinal column anymore.

I\u0027m already 90 pounds and I have no hair. I am not going to walk around for a year with a faucet sticking of my forehead.\" And my mom goes, \"No, I think it\u0027s more like a spigot.\""

And also, I wanted to get away from my home. So I get into my car, and I\u0027m driving to Book Soup, and sadness, the new current trend in thinking, overtook me."

Because who cares if I get lung cancer? I\u0027m not going live that long to even have lung cancer. So I\u0027m going to buy some cigarettes. Yes! I\u0027m going to buy a cigarette and I\u0027m going to smoke it. And I\u0027m going to go to Book Soup and I\u0027m going to buy that book from The Pope."

So then I go in, and then suddenly, I\u0027m kind of seized with a moment of embarrassment-- for some reason that I don\u0027t understand, since I get embarrassed continually throughout the day with no problem, apparently-- about asking for this book that The Pope wrote. So I come in and I kind of scan the bookstore out to see if there-- I was looking for a big 10-foot cutout of The Pope with his hands out and the book. There wasn\u0027t one."

So then I go back, and I go, \"No, not the Resnick book. The Pope. The Pope\u0027s book.\" So I go over and I get the Pope\u0027s Book, this book.

And all of a sudden-- now, this is the most embarrassing thing I\u0027ll ever say at Un-Cabaret-- without any warning, I let out the biggest fart. And I am not someone who has any problem with that. And I also find no humor in that kind of humor. And it\u0027s like a whistle has gone off at Book Soup. It\u0027s just like everyone looks up.

            "OK, here\u0027s something that most of us would never, ever do. When Julia Sweeney\u0027s brother got cancer, and then she got cancer, she decided she wanted to talk about it with strangers from a stage in a comedy club. After the worst of all these times was over, she turned some of these stories into a one-woman show, which became a book and a movie.",
            "But there\u0027s something about these original recordings that she made. During the same weeks that some of the most horrible things that can happen to a person were happening to her, there\u0027s something about these recordings which is just very remarkable. Her feelings are right there on the surface.",
            "There\u0027s this saying that comedy equals tragedy plus time, which isn\u0027t always true but is mostly true. And in this case, there is just no time, right? Sometimes you get the feeling when you hear these recordings that she\u0027s talking about these things for the very first time with anybody. And it\u0027s from a stage.",
            "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I\u0027m Ira Glass. This, of course, is your weekly program documenting everyday life in these United States through whatever means and tactics seem necessary. And of course, most weeks, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme, documentaries, monologues, found tapes, occasional radio plays, anything we can think of.",
            "But today, what we\u0027re going to do is devote the entire program to just one thing, to this very unusual set of comic monologues. Today show\u0027s is going to proceed in two acts. Act One, Julia\u0027s Brother Gets Cancer. Act Two, Julia is diagnosed with cancer herself and gets treated. These recordings were made between October of 1994 and August of 1995 at a regular weekly comedy show called Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles, run by Beth Lapides and Greg Miller.",
            "Un-Cabaret started off as this kind of experiment in reaction to the predictability and lowest-common-denominator mentality of a lot of stand-up comedy. The rules of Un-Cabaret were that no comic was allowed to tell a story that he or she had ever told on stage before. So spontaneity was just built into the structure of it. And the way it would work is that every Sunday night, back in its early days, five or six people would go up, often with notes in their hands, onto the stage, and then do this thing that was somewhere between traditional stand-up and diary and a kind of reportage. It had its own very particular kind of feeling to it.",
            "Some quick caveats before we begin. These tapes are made from the soundboard at Un-Cabaret. And so the sound quality isn\u0027t always the greatest. Also, sometimes you\u0027re going to hear laughing and off-stage comments during the monologues. And these are from the MC and ringmaster at Un-Cabaret, Beth Lapides.",
            "Some things you should know about Julia Sweeney before we start that she refers to in these monologues. She was in the cast of Saturday Night Live for a while. She\u0027s best known for a character named Pat. And the joke with Pat was that nobody could ever tell if Pat was a man or a woman. And there was a Pat movie, which, as she refers to, didn\u0027t really do too well."

When Julia Sweeney\u0027s brother got cancer, and then she got cancer, she decided she wanted to talk about it with strangers from a stage in a comedy club. After the worst of all these times was over, she turned some of these stories into a one-woman show, which became a book and a movie."

The rules of Un-Cabaret were that no comic was allowed to tell a story that he or she had ever told on stage before. So spontaneity was just built into the structure of it. And the way it would work is that every Sunday night, back in its early days, five or six people would go up, often with notes in their hands, onto the stage, and then do this thing that was somewhere between traditional stand-up and diary and a kind of reportage. It had its own very particular kind of feeling to it."

            "OK, but you wonder, what\u0027s Dad doing? He reads. He just buries himself in reading. And then, my dad is a diabetic. Hmm, weird. And then my brother, who is now living with me also, he gives himself shots every day for his blood counts. And so there\u0027s just syringes hanging around my house. And so a common thing for me is like, \"OK, who left their syringes on the kitchen table? Dad? We have to throw them away and break the needle.\" All right.",
            "OK, so this is all an introduction to last Thursday. And then I get to the The Pope, so just wait. OK, so we\u0027re in the doctor\u0027s office. And Mike, who\u0027s doing really great and is responding really well to the treatment, but he\u0027s had so many spinal taps that they can\u0027t get into his spinal column anymore. So the doctors come in. And my dad\u0027s reading about the plague in India, because that\u0027s a good diversion. And my mom is looking at the doctors and saying, \"Now, he looks single.\" And this doctor comes in, and he says, \"Michael, we can\u0027t get into your spinal column anymore. So we\u0027re thinking about putting a shunt in your head.\"",
            "And my brother goes, \"What?\" And he goes, \"A shunt.\" And I go, \"A shunt, like an artificial opening to the brain.\" And Mike goes, \"Well, where would this shunt be?\" And the doctor goes, \"Well, the best place we\u0027ve found is to put it in the forehead.\" And Mike goes, \"If you think I am going to get a faucet put into my forehead. I\u0027m already 90 pounds and I have no hair. I am not going to walk around for a year with a faucet sticking of my forehead.\" And my mom goes, \"No, I think it\u0027s more like a spigot.\"",
            "And then the doctor goes, \"But the people we know, the patients that have the shunt, they love it. Oh, they thank me for it because the pain is so much less, and when we do the operation, because it\u0027s in the brain, there\u0027s no pain.\" And my brother goes, \"Oh, that\u0027s because you give them lobotomies before you put the faucet in!\" And then my dad\u0027s looking up from his article on the plague.",
            "Anyway, as you can imagine, I got a little depressed that [INAUDIBLE]. So Thursday night, I decided that I wanted-- because, as you may know, The Pope wrote a book, and it came out on Thursday. So I had to be right there to get it. And also, I wanted to get away from my home. So I get into my car, and I\u0027m driving to Book Soup, and sadness, the new current trend in thinking, overtook me.",
            "And I had no makeup on, a little lipstick, and overalls, which are not a good choice for me. And I looked terrible, but I though I\u0027d go to Book Soup. And then I started crying. And I started thinking, oh, why, why, why? Why can\u0027t it just end? I just don\u0027t want to go on. And if I am going to end and I really am just going to be over, why can\u0027t I smoke? Because who cares if I get lung cancer? I\u0027m not going live that long to even have lung cancer. So I\u0027m going to buy some cigarettes. Yes! I\u0027m going to buy a cigarette and I\u0027m going to smoke it. And I\u0027m going to go to Book Soup and I\u0027m going to buy that book from The Pope.",
            "So I\u0027m sobbing and sobbing. So I get to Book Soup. And I kind of wipe my eyes, and I they\u0027re all red and everything. So then I go in, and then suddenly, I\u0027m kind of seized with a moment of embarrassment-- for some reason that I don\u0027t understand, since I get embarrassed continually throughout the day with no problem, apparently-- about asking for this book that The Pope wrote. So I come in and I kind of scan the bookstore out to see if there-- I was looking for a big 10-foot cutout of The Pope with his hands out and the book. There wasn\u0027t one.",
            "So I had to go to the information desk. And I go, \"Hi, I\u0027m looking for a book that came out today.\" And the guy goes, \"Oh, jeez, it\u0027s right over there.\" And I\u0027m thinking, \"The Pope\u0027s doing some business on these books.\" So I go over to this area, and it\u0027s that Resnick Nicole Simpson book. So then I go back, and I go, \"No, not the Resnick book. The Pope. The Pope\u0027s book.\" So I go over and I get the Pope\u0027s Book, this book. And then I think, oh, I don\u0027t really want to just buy The Pope\u0027s book.",
            "So somehow, I end up in the self-help section. Hmm. And I\u0027m looking at titles like Can You Live Through This? and You Can Make It and Why Do Things Happen to People and stuff like that. And then finally, I find this book-- oh, I wrote down the title. It was An Atheist\u0027s Guide to Getting Through the Day. There is a tomorrow. I thought, that\u0027s the book for me.",
            "So now I have The Atheist\u0027s Guide to Getting Through the Day and The Pope\u0027s book. And I\u0027m thinking, all right, I think I\u0027m covered. And there\u0027s not very many people in the book store, and I keep having to remind you how awful I look. And all of a sudden-- now, this is the most embarrassing thing I\u0027ll ever say at Un-Cabaret-- without any warning, I let out the biggest fart. And I am not someone who has any problem with that. And I also find no humor in that kind of humor. And it\u0027s like a whistle has gone off at Book Soup. It\u0027s just like everyone looks up. And then I don\u0027t how whether to rush out of that area or look around or-- it was terrible.",
            "OK, my parents are staying with me this week. And when I say this week, I mean it\u0027s just the first of many weeks. They keep saying, \"Now, we\u0027ve got to start planning the Thanksgiving dinner.\" And then my mom goes, \"Why are you crying?\" And I go, \"Oh, my eyes are watering. I have this weird problem with my sinuses.\" It\u0027s a special feeling to be in your mid-30s and have your parents moving in with you.",
            "OK, so right at that moment, this guy comes up and goes, \"Julia?\" Like, \"You heard my call. You recognized my fart.\" Anyway, I don\u0027t recognize him at all. And I go, \"Hi.\" And he goes, \"Oh, you don\u0027t recognize me, do you?\" And I go, [MAKES UNCOMFORTABLE SOUNDS]",
            "And he goes, \"Marshall from The Groundlings.\" And I go-- who I have no memory of-- \"Marshall, oh, Marshall. Here I am. I\u0027m getting the Pope\u0027s book. How are you?\" And he goes, \"So hey, when\u0027s the Pat movie coming out?\" Big, red eyes. OK, here\u0027s my standard response. \"They opened it in Houston and Seattle, and nobody went or liked it. So, I don\u0027t know.\"",
            "And he goes, \"Oh, so it was a bomb.\" And I go, \"Just because no one saw it, that means it\u0027s a bomb? It\u0027s a hit to me.\" And he goes, \"Oh, well anyway, I\u0027m sorry.\" And he goes, \"So hey, how\u0027s Steve?\" And I go, \"Oh, well, we got divorced this year, but amicably. And really good friend. He\u0027s seeing someone, and we talk every day.\"",
            "\"Oh, no, you guys were the cutest couple.\"",
            "\"Yeah, well.\"",
            "And then he goes, \"Oh, is your brother still running the box office at The Groundlings?\" And I go, \"Well, no.\" He goes, \"Oh, what\u0027s he up to?\" \"Well, he\u0027s got lymph cancer. Stage four. And so, well, I\u0027m going to go pay for my books.\"",
            "So I put back the atheist book, because I really thought my book is really The Agnostic\u0027s Guide to Getting Through the Day. I have a little hope. Not a lot. OK.",
            "So I go out, I go across the street, I buy a pack of cigarettes. So now I\u0027m really going to enjoy myself. I get into the car. My family uses my car all the time for transportation purposes. It\u0027s the normal use of a car. And they hate cigarette smoke, like anyone should. OK, so I roll down all the windows, and I\u0027m smoking, and I\u0027m actually starting to feel better because Marshall was just such a horrific situation that you could only feel better. You just had to go up.",
            "So I\u0027m smoking, and I\u0027m really happy. And then finally, I\u0027m getting close to home, so I throw the cigarette out. And then I keep driving, and all of a sudden, I smell this really smoky smell. And then I pull into the driveway, and I turn around, and my back seat is on fire. The cigarette has flown back into the car and had ignited my seats in the back. So I get out of the car, and I throw the cigarette out, and I\u0027m feeling very like a girl who\u0027s just been smoking pot or something going into the house.",
            "Oh, which by the way, the prescribed pot for my brother, so my brother\u0027s also just smoking pot all around the house all the time. So I go in, and as soon as I get in, my mom goes, \"I want to use your car keys. I have to go to the store and get something.\" And I go, \"Oh, god, you can\u0027t believe what just happened to me. I was driving down Sunset, and this old man smoking a cigarette threw it out of his car. And I noticed, because I thought, smoking is terrible. And I got back, and the cigarette had landed in my car and burnt a hole into the back seat.",
            "I haven\u0027t revealed why my parents are here for so long until this time. And I\u0027m trying to think very hard about the most hilarious way I can get this across. Oh, please be with me tonight. All right. So briefly, there\u0027s five kids in our family. I\u0027m the oldest. And my brother, who\u0027s the fourth child, got lymph cancer. Hold for laughs. And it\u0027s a very tragic, terrible situation, although he\u0027s doing very well. And he is at the UCLA Cancer Center. And every day, he has radiation, and every other day, he has a spinal tap and spinal chemo. And every three weeks, he has the big chemo.",
            "And my mom\u0027s like, \"Oh, that\u0027s the most horrible thing I\u0027ve ever heard.\" And she\u0027s going, \"Now, an old man was smoking next to you? And I\u0027m like, \"Yes, right next to me. Well, on the passenger-- I had the passenger window open where he would be on the other side of the-- because-- yes. And I noticed him, that creep.\" And so she goes, \"Oh, that\u0027s so horrible.\" So she takes the car and goes.",
            "And then the next morning, my dad and mom are coming out, and the cigarette that was the culprit was on the driveway. And my dad looks down. I go, \"Well, there\u0027s the cigarette.\" My dad picks it up, and he goes, \"There\u0027s lipstick on it.\" And I go, \"Oh!\" And my mom goes, \"You said it was an old man.\" And I go, \"Well, Sunset Boulevard, you know.\"",
            "My parents are staying with me. I know I say that every week since September because that, in fact, is practically the case. Anyway, my parents are here because I have a brother who is very ill with cancer. And I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s doing well or not anymore. But he is very, very ill. So my parents are down. And like any stressful situation, their annoying qualities, their personalities, are heightened because it\u0027s a crisis situation. And it\u0027s made even more difficult for me because I can\u0027t yell at them about it because we are in a crisis. And it\u0027s like, how could I really scream at my mother for talking incessantly when her son is so very ill?",
            "So Wednesday night, I go out. And my brother, he weighs 120 pounds and he\u0027s 5\u0027 11\u0027\u0027. And he\u0027s taking lots of drugs, and we don\u0027t know if it\u0027s for the cancer. And we don\u0027t know if we should yell at him about the drugs, but then he has cancer, so you don\u0027t really want to get down on someone at that moment for that. Anyway, OK, this is just so sad. I am going to try my [BLEEP] hardest to make this funny, all right?",
            "So I go see House Guest because I\u0027m going to see Phil Hartman next week, and I want to have seen it. Although now, I probably shouldn\u0027t have seen it. I kept thinking all the way home, what are the scenes I can say you were funny in? Which scene? And he\u0027s a very funny guy, so it\u0027s too bad, but I guess it\u0027s making money. And the whole time I was watching, I was thinking. \"Pat doesn\u0027t get a national release and House Guest gets a national release?\"",
            "So this is my Wednesday. So I get home from House Guest, I walk in the house, my brother is laid out on the couch. Literally, he\u0027s laid out. He\u0027s laying there with his hands on his chest with blankets over him, like, has Mike died while I was at House Guest? Does someone come rushing up to me and saying, \"We don\u0027t know which coroner to call.\" I go, \"Oh, Mike.\"",
            "And he\u0027s like, \"I\u0027m feeling better,\" And I go, \"Oh, and you look great.\" And I go in and my mom intercepts, and she goes, \"Oh, hi. I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here because I was wondering how House Guest was because I like Sinbad. And I like him because I watched him on TV. And the TV in the living room doesn\u0027t coordinate with the cable anymore. And I don\u0027t know how to change that, because I want to watch a movie later. And the movie\u0027s on a video. And I don\u0027t even know how to put the video into the machine. And I was going to try, but I was making some soup, and the soup started boiling over, and your father is too drunk to deal with it.\"",
            "OK. I go into the kitchen. My dad\u0027s standing in the kitchen with his drink. He goes, \"Hey, how was House Guest? Because I like that Phil Hartman.\" And I go, \"Oh, it was OK.\" And then my mom comes running in. She goes, \"There\u0027s no cat food. there\u0027s no cat food.\" And I notice that all the cats are like, \"meow, meow, meow\" under my feet. Oh, also, the other thing is, having your parents in your house-- if they\u0027re like my parents-- means having every available audio device going in every room. The TV is on in every room of the house that there can be TV, and if there isn\u0027t a TV, the radio\u0027s going on in that room. So there\u0027s just this sound everywhere. And then \"meow, meow, meow\" of the cats.",
            "So I go, \"There\u0027s no cat food?\" And she goes, \"I was going to go to the store and get some, but then I didn\u0027t know what kind because you said the Friskies had too much fat in it, and [MOCKING SOUNDS]\" So I go, \"OK, I\u0027ll go to Pavilions now. It\u0027s midnight, but I\u0027ll go and get some cat food!\"",
            "So all you need to know about this is that I am with my parents, but in a very trying situation where I can\u0027t really yell at them for the small, annoying things that they do-- which I would do normally-- because of the largess of the total situation. And yet, for you, I can kvetch a little bit. All right.",
            "So I leave, and thank God it was three for $0.89. It was a big sale. And there\u0027s nothing like being a single woman in her 30s buying $15 of cat food at midnight. That\u0027s a really good feeling. So I buy my cat food, and then I get home. And in the meantime, my dad goes, \"The cats were so hungry that I gave them the dry food they hate, and they won\u0027t eat it.\" And I go, oh, and I look down, and the bowls are filled with this dry food they hate that I don\u0027t know why I have.",
            "So I go, \"OK, well, I\u0027m just going to throw that out.\" And then my dad goes, \"No, I\u0027ll save that dry food for later. I have a Tupperware bowl out for it, to put in the dry cat food.\" And he\u0027s got one side of the cat food bowl and I\u0027ve got the other. And I\u0027m going, \"No, no, no. I\u0027m just going to throw it away.\" And he\u0027s going, \"No, no, no. I\u0027m just going to put it in the Tupperware.\" And I\u0027m going, \"No, no, no. I am really willing to just toss caution to the wind and throw this cat food away.\" And he\u0027s going, \"No, no, no.\"",
            "And then, of course, we pull it apart. Cat food goes flying all over the kitchen. There\u0027s little pieces of cat food everywhere, landing in the soup that\u0027s boiling over. And then my dad leans down, and he\u0027s picking it up and putting pieces of cat food with the hair and aaaaagh! And then, at that moment-- So I go, OK, I\u0027ll just pick up my messages. And then I pick up my messages, and I have a message from my gynecologist at 9:30 PM saying, \"Call us immediately. We think you have a tumor.\"",
            "And while I\u0027m getting that message, my mom\u0027s standing there going, \"Do you know about a place called House of Blues?\" And I\u0027m going, \"I\u0027m trying to listen to my messages!\" And then the next message is from him going, \"Oh, I\u0027m terribly sorry. We\u0027ve mixed up your results with someone else.\" So then, I hang up the phone, and I\u0027m going, \"Yes, I\u0027ve heard of the House of Blues.\"",
            "And she goes, \"I love blues and gospel. I just love that. I love that music because I just love Gershwin.\" I don\u0027t even anymore-- like, 10 years ago, I would\u0027ve said, \"Gershwin isn\u0027t gospel or blues!\" But now, I just go, \"Oh, I know. The blues and gospel with the Gershwin. Go to the House of Blues. They got it.\"",
            "So I get the cat food out, I break it up, I put it down, the cats are happy. The phone starts ringing, my mom\u0027s going, \"Do you think House of Blues would be under \u0027night life\u0027 in the Yellow Pages?\" \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a \u0027night life\u0027 section in the Yellow Pages, but look all you want.\" And it\u0027s my sister calling from Japan. And she\u0027s like this, [CRYING] \"Hi, I\u0027m so glad you answered the phone, because mom and dad want me to pay them that $48 to the National Geographic subscriptions before they get the bill on their credit card, which I don\u0027t think is right. So I have written out a check for them for $100, and I\u0027m going to send it to them with a the note saying, \u0027I don\u0027t want anymore dealings with you.\u0027\"",
            "And I just go, \"Meg, I cannot talk to you right now.\" And she goes, \"Oh, fine!\" And I\u0027m just thinking of her in Japan crying about these [BLEEP] National Geographic subscriptions that no one even wants. I, by the way, am one of the recipients. So isn\u0027t it great that I have to get the magazine and know all these trauma and subterfuge that goes on getting the subscription to National Geographic?",
            "Then, I realized the most [BLEEP] up thing I was thinking this week is that I\u0027ve got to get over, somehow-- because apparently, I refuse to go to therapy, but anyway-- is I\u0027ve always had this thing where, like my mom-- it started with my mom. Obviously, our tastes and everything were different. Like, I would never decorate the way they did, and all of you, I\u0027m sure, feel the same way. But we\u0027d look at furniture, and I\u0027d go, well, I like the dark wood one, and she\u0027d like, of course, the modern. And she\u0027d always go, \"Well, when you get your house, you can have what you want in it.\"",
            "So that was her big thing. Or I\u0027d go, \"Why are you yelling at Jimmy\"-- my youngest brother-- \"this way?\" And she\u0027d say, \"Well, when you have a child, you can treat him the way you want, but I\u0027m going to--\"",
            "So I have this mental thing, like I always am trying to be better than some experience in my past. It\u0027s like I\u0027m always trying to have a better house to show-- like, my parents are going to learn how to raise kids better because of the way I treat my cats? I don\u0027t think so. But I realize the most [BLEEP] up thing is-- oh, just one other thing.",
            "So anyway, suffice it to say, we\u0027re at UCLA Cancer Center every day for several hours. My mother-- who is, by the way, the same age as Dustin Hoffman. They were born on the same day. Keep this in mind. Every time we get on an elevator, she acts like it\u0027s a miracle invention that she\u0027s never encountered before. And you can imagine how many times we get on elevators in a given day. Many elevators. Every time I get on the elevator, even if it\u0027s just she and I getting on the elevator, I immediately push the \"door open\" button because it takes so [BLEEP] long for her to get in the elevator.",
            "So my brother, they don\u0027t know-- now the cancer, they keep taking tests, and the cancer gets less and less, but he seems to be deteriorating anyway. And now they think it\u0027s the drugs. So my mom keeps going, \"We need to do an intervention with him on the drugs. And he\u0027s not going to listen to me, and he\u0027s not going to listen to your father. So we\u0027ve decided you should do it.\" I\u0027m like, \"Well, can I do an intervention on his answering machine? Because I don\u0027t have time to really run over there and do this intervention right at this moment.\" But I realized I was walking around this week thinking, \"You know, when I have cancer, I am going to act so much better.\"",
            "And every time, she goes, \"Oh, oh!\" when the elevator arrives. And then I go in and push the \"door open,\" and then she goes, \"Oh!\" And then she takes a moment before she goes over the chasm between the hallway and the elevator itself, that little metal thing. \"Hurry up because the doors are going to close automatically!\" God!",
            "And then, she always get in, and then she looks up like, \"Oh!\" And then when we go, she goes, [INAUDIBLE GESTURE] And then when they open, she goes, \"Oh?\" It\u0027s like, I really don\u0027t think Dustin Hoffman does that. And how many millions of times have we been on elevators together? A billion.",
            "So the other thing is, my mother, she\u0027s from that generation that thinks that you would never get a second opinion about anything because doctors know everything. And also, she believes that all doctors have the same amount of knowledge in every area. So we\u0027re talking to the lymph specialist, and then we\u0027ll be walking down the hall, and there\u0027ll be a group of doctors. We know because they\u0027re men. And they\u0027re not rushing around looking very caring. That\u0027s the signal. And then she goes, \"There\u0027s some doctors. Go ask them if they know about lymph cancer.\"",
            "And I go, \"We\u0027re talking to the lymph cancer specialist in the country. I think he knows the most about lymph cancer. I don\u0027t know what these doctors do.\" And she goes, \"Well, I got the home phone number of Dr. Nishamura, my old OB/GYN. And I was thinking you should call him and ask him about Mike\u0027s condition.\" So I go, \"Mom, I really don\u0027t think a gynecologist who\u0027s been retired for 20 years is going to know that much about this.\""

A lot of the stories that Julia Sweeney tells about cancer are basically just stories about her family. Her brother moved in with her when he got cancer to be near the cancer treatment center very early in his illness. And then her parents moved in soon after that.",
            "That was Un-Cabaret in October of 1994. Julia Sweeney\u0027s next turn at the microphone-- this next one that we\u0027re going to hear-- was three months later, in January of 1995.",
            "Well, long after all this, Julia Sweeney said that after she made that comment at Un-Cabaret, when she herself was diagnosed with cancer, people who had been at the club that night would come up to her and remind her what she said. Like, you see? You see? What do you really say to that? Well, coming up, how to make jokes about your own cancer and actually get laughs, an onstage demonstration. That\u0027s in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International, when our program continues."

And if I wanted to have a child surrogately, I could have it. So that was fine. They saved those.",

And they had to do all these x-rays and MRIs to make sure that my ovaries were out of the way of the radiation. And they cut my fallopian tubes and my uterus is out and all that stuff.",

So this guy, at first, he was kind of smiling at me a little too much, like maybe he recognized me from SNL, but I wasn\u0027t sure. And I\u0027m not going to really bring it up. And he\u0027s not saying anything. But he gave me that kind of look like, \"Hi!\" And I was like, \"Does everyone who gets radiation get that look?\" But anyway.",
            "So then, he\u0027s tattooing my vagina. So we\u0027re spending some time together. And he\u0027s down there, doing it. And I just find it so funny that it was hard not to laugh, but you can\u0027t laugh because it has to be a really specific spot. But then I keep thinking, \"My vagina is getting a tattoo.\"",
            "And then, all of a sudden, he\u0027s going like this, and then he goes, \"I think the best one is when Pat went to the barber.\" [BLEEP], you know? I\u0027m like, \"Yeah, that was a good one too. I think the kicker is now that Pat has cervical cancer, we know what--\" This is so personal. I can\u0027t even believe I\u0027m telling you guys this, but I guess that\u0027s the whole point of Un-Cabaret, even though it\u0027ll make you uncomfortable.",
            "So the first half is external radiation, where they beam you from the outside. And then the second half that I start next week is internal radiation. Think about it. OK, so I call it the \"dildo of radiation.\" And in fact, I insist on referring to it as the \"dildo of radiation,\" and the doctors get really upset. Because I go, \"When do we start the dildo of radiation?\" So I had to go in and get measured, and they had to make this cylinder that fit exactly me and everything.",
            "So then I go, \"So this dildo of radiation, will it be vibrating?\" And then the doctor goes, \"Actually, it will be vibrating.\" And I said, \"It will?\" It\u0027s sick, because the light in this doctor\u0027s eyes when he talks about how this is the cutting edge of technology, it scares me because I really feel like that\u0027s the point of it is that they get to do this to me. When they go like, \"Yes, you really need that, because this is the cutting edge of technology and hardly anyone\u0027s gotten this and we\u0027re really working on it!\" Do I really need it?",
            "Anyway, so I have to go. So then last week, they\u0027re trying to prepare me for it and everything. And they go, \"Well, you know, it lasts three hours.\" Oh my god, yes! So I go, \"Three hours?\" And they said yes. And I said, oh. And also, I won\u0027t get into details, but the other orifices in that area will also be filled with other instruments for three hours.",
            "And when they said, \"You have an option. We can send you to the cancer therapist at Cedars-Sinai to learn visualization techniques, or we can give you an IV of Valium. Actually, I kind of feel bad because they really were trying to push the visualization. So I just went, \"I am very good at visualizing. I\u0027m an actress and visualization is my hobby and my expertise.\" I think when it comes to medical procedures, an IV of Valium is going to work a lot better than thinking about an ocean.",
            "Oh yeah, this is another sick thing that I do. It\u0027s not funny, only sick. I have this thing where the clothes in my closet don\u0027t know that I have cancer. And if I haven\u0027t worn them since before when I found out I had cancer, I have to tell them when I put my clothes on. So I\u0027ll put on a dress, and I\u0027ll think, \"Oh, this dress doesn\u0027t even know.\" And so then I\u0027ll put on the dress and I\u0027ll think, \"Oh, dress. Don\u0027t you realize what\u0027s happened to me?\" And the dress goes, \"That\u0027s terrible, but you\u0027ll be OK.\"",
            "I didn\u0027t know where I was going. All I knew is his name was Dr. Fu. So I go over, and it\u0027s not really part of the hospital where the research is done. It\u0027s in this other building, and it\u0027s all restricted areas. And I just kept going through doors and doors where people were wearing more and more green things. And more people had masks and stuff. And I was knocking on doors. And everyone was so confused about what I wanted. And I\u0027d have to say, \"Hi, I\u0027m looking for the Julia Sweeney cancer slides.\" And they\u0027d all go, \"Oh, for who?\" And I\u0027d say, \"For Julia Sweeney-- me.\" And they\u0027d go, oh.",
            "And then finally, I found this Dr. Fu\u0027s door, and I knocked on it. And this little Asian man opens the door, and it\u0027s literally out of a movie. There\u0027s books to the ceiling and cobwebs and a little microscope. And he goes, \"Yes?\" And I said, \"Yes, I hear that you have the Julia Sweeney cancer slides.\" And he says, \"Yes.\" And I go, \"Yes, I\u0027ve come here to pick them up.\"",
            "And he said, \"Oh, what project are you working on?\" And I said, \"Oh, the Julia Sweeney project.\" And he said, \"No, no, no. I mean what research area are you in? And I said, \"No, I mean I\u0027m Julia Sweeney.\" And he said, \"What?\" And I said, \"Yeah, those slides, that\u0027s me. Those slides are me. And I want them. Give them back!\"",
            "And he goes, \"You\u0027re the person in these slides?\" He goes, \"Yeah, they\u0027re right here.\" He picks up the slides. And I go, \"Yeah.\" And he goes, \"You\u0027re this person?\" And I go, \"Yeah.\" And he goes, \"Oh my god.\" He goes, \"I have been getting grants to study this special kind of cancer for 20 years. And only 50 women in the world have been diagnosed with this special kind of cancer. And you\u0027re one of the ones I\u0027m studying, and I\u0027ve never met in the flesh any of the women that have ever had this cancer except for you.\"",
            "And I said, \"Oh.\" And he\u0027s like, \"Oh, please come in and sit down.\" And he said, \"Well, how does it feel to have this cancer?\" And I said, \"Well, you know, I actually have no symptoms. It\u0027s kind of hilarious that I just have no symptoms. It seems like all of the problems have been coming from the cure of this, but not from the actual cancer.\"",
            "And he goes, \"Oh, there\u0027s only 50 women in the world, and none of them have died from it.\" And I go, \"Oh, you can always hope.\" And I go, \"Oh, great.\" And he wanted to know if I\u0027d been on birth control pills, because that\u0027s what he thinks it was related to, which I had. And he\u0027s asking me, \"What are your habits?\" And I go, \"Well, I like to run and ski. Maybe people who run and ski and take birth control pills get this cancer.\"",
            "And then he goes, \"Well, can I take you out for some coffee or something?\" And I said yeah. And then we went and had this coffee, and he was just so happy to be with me, like, meeting this woman who had the cancer.",
            "OK, well, then I found out a few weeks later, after the slides went back, that I didn\u0027t have that cancer. I had a different kind of really rare cervical cancer, but not that specific kind. And I don\u0027t think they ever really told that guy, because this week, he called me up. And he said, \"Hey, how are you doing?\" and everything. And I said, \"Oh, I\u0027m fine. I did all of the surgeries and the radiation. I\u0027m feeling great.\" And he said, \"That\u0027s so great.\"",
            "And then I realized that I was too embarrassed to tell him I didn\u0027t have his cancer. I go, \"Yeah.\" And he goes, \"Well, I\u0027m really glad. No one who\u0027s had that cancer has died. They\u0027ve had to go through hell, but they haven\u0027t died.\" And then I just had to play into it. And then I realized that I\u0027m so co-dependent that I didn\u0027t want him to think that I didn\u0027t have the cancer he was studying. I had to pretend. So sick.",
            "I don\u0027t have cancer anymore. I only say this because-- I don\u0027t know if anyone was here for other sets where I talked about it-- but I got a little cancer. And I did surgery, and I did radiation. And my last radiation was on Wednesday. And so now I can\u0027t say I have cancer anymore, which I have to say, I will totally cop to the fact that I\u0027m kind of missing that, because I just loved not necessarily doing, but having that moment where I could say, \"I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve heard, but I have cancer.\"",
            "But now I can say, \"I am in remission.\" I guess that\u0027s the term, although no doctor has even said that to me. They just said, \"All right, you did enough. See you later.\" I said, \"Don\u0027t you mean to tell me I\u0027m in remission?\"",
            "So about a month ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. Hold for laugh. All right. I wake up debating how and if I should bring that up. But the thing is, it\u0027s not life-threatening and I\u0027m totally fine. And you know, in a way, I\u0027m kind of happy for the experience. But my parents, who are staying with me way too long, and at the tail end of when they were going to be with me, then I got cervical cancer.",
            "So on Wednesday, I had to have my last radiation. And it\u0027s this kind of horrible ordeal that lasts three hours and is very personally invasive into certain orifices of your body. Imagine. See, for my surgery-- this is how sick I am-- I had horrible abdominal surgery, and it was incredibly painful, tubes coming out of me.",
            "And they gave me Percocet and codeine and everything. And I would be in excruciating pain and not take my pain pills to save them for a day when I\u0027d enjoy them more. That\u0027s when my parents were staying with me, and I\u0027d be going, \"Aaaaaaa!\" And my mother would go, \"Take the codeine.\" And I\u0027d go, \"There will be a day when, mixed with a margarita, I will be so much happier.\"",
            "So anyway, this is not even funny. OK, I\u0027ll just tell it really quick. I went to another audition. It was actually a meeting. I felt like it went really well, and it was like, wow, this is a possibility, and this is great. And I\u0027m driving back from Santa Monica, feeling so happy for the first time in a really long time because my parents are living with me. And I\u0027m so happy.",
            "And so I walk in the door, and as I walk in the door, I hear my mother yelling at my brother. \"You\u0027re drunk. That\u0027s what it is.\" Like some sort of awful Arthur Miller play or something. So then I come in, and I go, \"Hi.\" And she goes, \"How was your meeting?\" And I go, \"It was good.\" And she goes, \"Well, your brother\u0027s been drinking. And he is D-R-U-N-K. Then my brother-- oh, this story is too sad. I have to stop it.",
            "OK, well, let\u0027s just say this. My brother leaves the room and starts smoking pot in the other room. And then my mom\u0027s going on and on, and she doesn\u0027t know how to tell stories correctly. And I know you\u0027re thinking it\u0027s a familial trait. But she\u0027ll say, \"Oh, I have to tell you the most important thing. I went to Pavilions, and I ran into this couple from the Balkans. And your father was reading that book. And then I couldn\u0027t find the change for the ten, and then the car, and so--\" And I just go, \"Oh, huh. When you can\u0027t find your change and you meet someone from the Balkans at the store, and why are you talking to people at Pavilions?\"",
            "So I just walk out of the house and go to the office where my dad is. And my dad goes, \"Oh, hi. I borrowed this book off your shelf-- The Balkan Ghost, which is all travel essays written by this reporter about his travels in the Balkans. And those Balkan people, they\u0027re crazy. Did you know about Adam the Impaler, who impaled people?\" And I go, \"Oh, no.\"",
            "And then he says, \"Oh, and it reminded me of this other book Rebecca West wrote, this great travelogue that was written in 1937 about her travels in the Balkans, and it really foretold a lot of stuff. And do you know that every major war is started in the Balkans?\" And we had this nice little conversation. And he\u0027s like, \"And how was your meeting?\" And I go, \"Oh, it was really good.\" And he goes, \"Oh, I\u0027m so glad.\"",
            "Then I come back in the house. Mom goes, \"I need to talk to you in the bedroom.\" So I go-- oh, I\u0027d better go quick because this is so sad-- so I go into the bedroom, and she goes, \"Your father is driving me crazy, and I\u0027m leaving him. But I\u0027m not leaving your house, and neither is he.\" I go, \"So what does that mean?\" She goes, \"It means I am not sleeping in the guest room with him anymore. I need another place to sleep.\"",
            "And so, of course, they wanted to stay longer, which is the last thing I wanted was my parents to stay [BLEEP] longer with me. And then I kept thinking, \"How can I lie about my cervical cancer to my parents?\" And I\u0027m, like, 35. Can\u0027t I just have cancer on my own?\"",
            "And I\u0027m thinking, \"OK, the brother from Washington is sleeping on the sofa in my office. I\u0027m sleeping in the dining room. My other brother is in my bedroom. My parents are in the guest room.",
            "And I just go, \"Married people who visit me must sleep together. I do not have enough beds for people to break up while they\u0027re visiting me. You must overcome your feelings and just sleep in the same bed. Go in after he\u0027s fallen asleep, and get up before he wakes up. And don\u0027t touch him in the night, but you\u0027ve got to stay in the room!\"",
            "Anyway, so mom sleeps on the couch in the living room. Dad\u0027s in the guest room. So we\u0027re all in different places. So then, at 5:00 in the morning, I notice the TV pops on, and In a Lonely Place is starting at 5:00 in the morning. Irony. And my mom sits up, and she\u0027s going, \"What\u0027s this?\" And there must\u0027ve been something where I programmed the TV to tape something. She yells from the living room, she goes, \"Julie, there\u0027s a movie on about a lonely people. What is it?\"",
            "It\u0027s like 5:00 in the morning, so I go, \"Oh, In a Lonely Place. Yeah, Nicholas Ray and great film noir, Humphrey Bogart.\" And she goes, \"You know, he was a drunk. In real life, too.\" And I go, \"Oh.\" \"And Gloria Grahame.\" Anyway, so slowly, the whole family gets up. And then, all of a sudden, it\u0027s me, my two brothers, and my mom and dad. And we all watch In a Lonely Place. This is yesterday morning from 5:00 to 7:00 AM.",
            "So I had to get this radical hysterectomy, which now that I\u0027m in this whole cancer thing, radical doesn\u0027t mean far out in the medical world. I just want to let you know. Anyway, so then my mom, they just make me more nervous than calm. I really have friends that would be there and make it a more calm experience. But my mom goes, \"I am going to be with you for every doctor appointment and every surgery you\u0027re going to have.\" And then I found myself saying, like, \"My friends who\u0027ve had hysterectomies didn\u0027t have to have their moms with them. They had their hysterectomies on their own.\" And I just realized how [BLEEP] weird that is, but anyway.",
            "And I feel I wouldn\u0027t have chosen to have a hysterectomy, I guess. But I kind of feel about my reproductive organs like a bicycle that I\u0027ve had in the garage, this really great bike that I\u0027ve just never used. But I want to, you know? But I just never had time. And it\u0027s a really good bike. And it\u0027s in the garage, and I haven\u0027t really been maintaining it. It\u0027s all rusty now and everything. But it\u0027s there, and I bought it. And it\u0027s there. I have a garage for it. And now, I feel like fate is saying to me, \"OK, we\u0027re taking away your bicycle. You can never ride a bike again.\" And so then you think, \"god, I was really going to ride that bike.\"",
            "But it\u0027s not like the end of the world. It\u0027s like, well, there\u0027s a lot of other things. You can skate. Well, I can take the metaphor forever, but anyway. But young men-- especially at SNL, these young, 22-year-old writers they hire at SNL, they would call and go, [SOUNDING DEVASTATED] \"I heard that you were having a hysterectomy.\" I\u0027d go, \"Yeah, well, you know, I don\u0027t feel that sad about it.\" And they\u0027d go, \"That is the most tragic thing.\" These [BLEEP] guys. I\u0027d go, \"That\u0027s right, because now my worth as a woman has been taken away from me.\" And they\u0027d go, \"Mm-hmm.\" They don\u0027t even realize I\u0027m being sarcastic!",
            "And then, I would meet women-- women aren\u0027t that much better-- who would have these big new-age solutions. They\u0027d go, \"You know, my friend had cervical cancer, and they told her that she had to have a hysterectomy. And she drank carrot juice every day and did yoga. And now she\u0027s had seven children.\" And I\u0027m like, \"Get me to the hospital!\" Really? Aaagh!"

            "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. And most weeks on our program, we choose some subject and invite a wide variety of writers and performers to take a whack at that subject. And if you\u0027re just tuning in, what we\u0027re doing is that we are devoting an entire hour to these unusual recordings-- sort of part comedy, part diary-- about cancer. This is Julia Sweeney recorded at Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles.",
            "That was May of 1995. This next moment is a little further into her treatment-- a month later. And just a quick warning, some of the language here may not be suitable for younger listeners.",
            "We have now arrived at Act Two of our program. In this act, Julia gets diagnosed with cancer herself. And one thing that\u0027s interesting about these tapes is that once Julia Sweeney actually gets cancer, the stories get less dark. They are less tragic. There is less trouble in them. This next tape is from May of 1995. This is actually the worst sound quality of any of the tapes we\u0027re going to play for you today.",
            "OK, well, that was June 4, 1995. Not long after that, Julia Sweeney returned to Un-Cabaret. She was getting her treatment, still. And she was getting her treatment at one hospital, and her brother was getting treated at another hospital. And her case, apparently, was this very rare type of cervical cancer. And it turned out that the one doctor in this world who was studying this particular type of cancer happened to be located at his hospital, not at hers. And so at some point, slides of her cells were shipped over to his hospital. And then they were going to do some procedure on her, so she had to get the slides back so they could do this procedure. And she offered to go and fetch the slides herself.",
            "And just one quick word for public radio listeners who perhaps do not watch as much television as many Americans do. SNL-- she refers to SNL. SNL, in this context, is Saturday Night Live.",
            "All these stories that we\u0027ve been hearing began in 1994. And finally, in July of 1995, Julia Sweeney took the stage at Un-Cabaret to announce--",
            "Julia Sweeney survived her cancer and turned these monologues from Un-Cabaret into a one-woman show called God Said, \"Ha!\" Back in the 1990s, it played in Los Angeles, it played on Broadway at the Lyceum Theater. Julia put it out as a book. Quentin Tarantino turned it into a movie that you can still get on DVD.",
            "Anyway, Julia\u0027s brother did not survive his cancer. He died two weeks after she was diagnosed. But we thought we\u0027d end our program today with a story from January of 1995. This is taped before Julia knew that she had cancer. And when this was recorded, her brother was still alive, and family was really struggling.",
            "Julia Sweeney at Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles. Lately, Julia has been working on a new one-woman show, that we\u0027ve actually excerpted on This American Life already, called Letting Go of God. Next month, she plans to put out that show on CD. She\u0027s got plans to film that show. There\u0027s a book in the works, more live performances, the whole schmear. For details, you can go to her website with the incredibly difficult-to-remember name, www.juliasweeney.com."

Lately, Julia has been working on a new one-woman show, that we\u0027ve actually excerpted on This American Life already, called Letting Go of God. Next month, she plans to put out that show on CD. She\u0027s got plans to film that show. There\u0027s a book in the works, more live performances, the whole schmear. For details, you can go to her website with the incredibly difficult-to-remember name, www.juliasweeney.com."

They had their hysterectomies on their own.\" And I just realized how [BLEEP] weird that is, but anyway."

But I just never had time. And it\u0027s a really good bike. And it\u0027s in the garage, and I haven\u0027t really been maintaining it. It\u0027s all rusty now and everything.
