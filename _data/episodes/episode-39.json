This American Life producer Nancy Updike and I were in John\u0027s apartment for, I don\u0027t know, 10 minutes when a werewolf exited a scene, and through the open door, we could all witness this figure.

The lyrics are all screaming, and screaming is a really great thing. And it\u0027s a lot of fun to listen to. So I\u0027ll give you the first verse from a song called \"Vodun Goat\". [SCREAM]",

        "Hello, I was listening to the radio the other night, and I heard abou the scream line. And I just thought I\u0027d kind of leave a little story on how I scream, and where I do my screaming. Right now, I\u0027m calling you from a car phone. I work in Sacramento, California, and I live in the San Francisco Bay area.",

And so I\u0027m dealing with customers at my job, and I also have to deal with the other participants in this commute. So what I do is, when I\u0027m in the car, and I reach about, well, it\u0027s about this point in the drive-- I guess, I\u0027m about 75 miles into the drive-- I always, get all my anger, and stress, anxieties, and everything else with a good old scream.",
        "I really didn\u0027t know anybody else did anything like this until I heard your radio show. So here\u0027s my scream, and this is what I do. [SCREAM] And I really do feel much better after I do that. It clears my lungs. I actually can see better. Even though I wear glasses, I actually can see better.",

And on her desk, we did a nice big one, to let her know like where it came from. Because he threatened her, and we were his threat backup. So she left him alone after that. So I guess it got our point across.",

And yet, we just rocked her world. I mean, she was afraid for-- lord knows-- maybe years after that.",

And then you get this bold stance on you, and then you can hit someone. And you get all your nice anger out. But I couldn\u0027t just walk up and smack somebody.",

And they don\u0027t need know reason because they know everything. So all they need to do is go up there and do it. And one time my cousin said, well I just went up there and I clocked her. I said, you clocked her? You just clocked her? You didn\u0027t even say anything to her? She said, no, I didn\u0027t need to say anything to her. All I had to do was walk up and clock her. I said, so you walked up to her, you clocked her in the face, and that was it? She says yeah. And I\u0027m like, what were you thinking, when you walked-- She goes, I wasn\u0027t.",

And this is how I feel about it now, and I regret it. But some of them, they can\u0027t get past the fact that I did do it, so that makes it correct. And every time you turn around they say, but you did it, but you did it. And it\u0027s not the fact that I did it, it\u0027s the fact that I did it, I regret it, and I got out. That\u0027s what I want to pass, that I got out, and I regret it.",
        "See, that\u0027s like, when I was doing all this. There was nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong. I mean, so what? So I went in there and I wrecked a classroom. So what? So I hit somebody in the head or the ear, they shouldn\u0027t have been messing with me. So what?",

And nobody knew, because it looked like a dummy hanging there.",

        "At age eight, I just kind of wondered why it was there, and how they got it up there. That was my whole big thing. I think that, as a child, you wonder those things. And I just kept wondering, how did they get it up there? And I just thought it was newspaper. And it was a person.",
        "It was up there a couple days. It was up there a couple days. Because it was like stenching, it smelled, and they cut it down. The police came, and they cut it down. And the banana had already fell off. And that was it. And nobody said anything. Nothing went out. There was no screams. There was no nothing.

It was when I was out in my other neighborhood, this is where I became this big, bad, super person. And this is where I did all my damage. And why? Because I could.",

        "Now I don\u0027t know that I ever really talked to anything. I don\u0027t really know what was there. It was just a very strange experience. But still, we kept trying to find other explanations. And for me, I stopped trying to find other explanations when, one night, I woke up, I don\u0027t know why, and I just looked across the room, and there was a woman standing there. And she was just standing. She was looking around at things. She wasn\u0027t looking at me. She wasn\u0027t looking at anything that seemed to be in the room. She seemed to be looking far off. And then she turned, and she walked out of the room, right through the closed door.",
        "I thought about that for a while, quite a while. And I think I\u0027ve pretty much accepted now that I live in a house where there are ghosts, leftover pieces of other people who don\u0027t really see me, because the woman didn\u0027t seem to see me or anything in the room. Sometimes, I can see them. Sometimes they can move things and move me in ways that I can feel or see. Sometimes they can make noises. They certainly don\u0027t seem to be trying to bother us. I suppose, maybe, even they experience us as ghosts, because we probably look invisible to them, the way she couldn\u0027t see me. It\u0027s a very interesting house to live in."

        "The principal came in with Leon Anderson right behind him. What is it, Mrs. Wells? Is one of the children hurt? Mrs. Wells blushed. I guess it\u0027s not really an urgent emergency. I just felt we had to do something right away. Janice show him your costume. I couldn\u0027t believe it. She\u0027d said I was naked, and now she wanted me to show the principal and the whole class.",
        "Janice Ray, take that blanket off. I stood up and put the blanket on the chair behind me. I looked at the floor. After a minute, the principal said, well, there is a requirement that children wear shoes to school for health reasons, but if she stays off the playground, I don\u0027t think anything will happen in just one day. Janice, you tell your mother that your costume next year has to include shoes.",
        "Mrs. Wells grabbed his arm. Can I talk to you in the hall. I could see them talking outside the door as I put the blanket back around me. At first the principal looked like something was funny. But Mrs. Wells didn\u0027t calm down. Then he looked mad and did the rest of the talking.",
        "When Mrs. Wells came back in, she walked over to me and jerked the blanket away. Janice, give me the blanket. It seems I have overreacted. Her face was red, and she sounded like she was reciting a lesson. She didn\u0027t look at me. There\u0027s nothing inappropriate about your costume, although bare feet are extremely unhygienic. Go to your regular seat.",
        "Can I keep the blanket? No, you may not keep the blanket. There\u0027s absolutely nothing wrong with your costume. In fact, I think you should stand up in front of the class, so we\u0027ll all have a chance to look at it. It will be good for all of us to see what\u0027s acceptable, so we don\u0027t overreact again.",
        "For 15 minutes, she made me stand there, while the other kids looked at me and giggled behind their hands. I thought about all the temptresses I knew, about Bathsheba, and Delilah, and about Salome who danced nearly naked so they\u0027d cut off John the Baptist\u0027s head. I thought of the movie ads with Carol Baker in baby-doll pajamas sucking her thumb, that all the preachers were mad about. And I thought about Marilyn Monroe with her skirt blowing up, looking happy. And how everyone said, Joe DiMaggio had divorced her because her skirt blew up.",
        "And if part of me was excited that I could be a temptress like Eve, and Bathsheba, and Delilah, and Salome, and Carol Baker, and Marilyn Monroe, and maybe even like Elizabeth Taylor, most of me was horrified that I was sinful, and causing sin in others without even knowing how or why. It was just something I was, not something I did or even thought.",
        "I thought of Daddy seeing the picture of me, nearly naked, and I knew I had ruined everything. He wouldn\u0027t think I was a good sweet girl anymore. No one who knew about the costume would ever think I was a good girl again.",
        "I got to spend the whole day at school bare-legged, bare-footed, bare-shouldered, feeling totally naked. At recess and lunch, I rushed to the bathroom, locked myself in a stall, and pulled my feet up so their nakedness wouldn\u0027t show.",
        "The next time Daddy came to see us, I was embarrassed and stayed in my room. And six months later, when Jimmy [? Rigga ?] pulled me into an alley and kissed me, I let him, even though I liked Leon Anderson. And the next day, I saw Jimmy whispering to Leon and knew they were talking about me. And two years later, when the principal at my new school got the sixth grade girls alone in the closet and rubbed all up and down our fronts, I was the only one who didn\u0027t tell her mother. Because he was a deacon at the First Baptist Church, and I was a temptress.",
        "I was raised a Baptist, a Southern Baptist in west Texas. So I always knew that I was a sinner. But it wasn\u0027t until Halloween day in the fourth grade that I thought of myself as a sinful being. Before that, sin was something that could be overcome through hard work, prayer, reading the Bible, and thinking of a way out of coveting Tommy Sue Bailey\u0027s new Madame Alexander doll. Afterwards, I knew sin was part of me, in every molecule of my body, and I could never get rid of it.",
        "I was very excited about going to school on Halloween day. Mother had decided I could look like Daisy Mae Yokum, Lil\u0027 Abner\u0027s wife in the funny papers. She cut off and fringed a pair of old jeans. She found a peasant blouse, which we ripped, then pinned together with a diaper pin. She put my hair in pigtails and painted freckles on my nose. When she finished, she said, you look so cute. Let\u0027s take a picture to send your daddy.",
        "Daddy lived 80 miles away in Amarillo. He visited pretty often now, and he and mother wrote letters. I smiled my best smile for the picture, a smile that would show daddy what a good, pretty girl I was and, make him want to come home to stay.",
        "The next day, I went to school bare-legged, bare-footed, bare-shouldered, knowing that about half my friends would have ripped up one of their father\u0027s old dress shirts and come as bums, and the other half would have dug out old cowboy guns and cowboy hats and called that a costume. I thought I had a chance at the prize. I imagined my teacher\u0027s reaction. Janice, you\u0027re just the cutest thing, she\u0027d say, and so clever. Maybe she\u0027d hug me, like she did sometimes.",
        "Mrs. Wells was the first teacher I idolized. She was young and pretty, sweet and vivacious. She dressed in pastels and smelled like cotton candy. She had just married, and her husband was a part-time football coach and a part-time Baptist minister. For a while, I wished my mother would die and she\u0027d adopt me, but I realized that was a sinful thought. So I wished there was some kind of big sister organization, and she\u0027d be my big sister, and maybe my mother would decide I should live with her, because she lived closer to church or something.",
        "On Halloween, I stopped just inside the classroom door, waiting for her to see me, posing a little, excited for her reaction. When she turned, her mouth dropped open. Janice Ray Hopewell, what are you thinking of? That outfit is indecent, it\u0027s obscene. You look like a little temptress. Why, you\u0027re practically naked.",
        "A temptress? Naked? I didn\u0027t know I was naked. Then I thought of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and how they didn\u0027t know they were naked. I looked down at my feet and legs and saw them as the feet and legs of a naked temptress. While Mrs. Wells talked to me, she pulled Ernesto Rodriguez\u0027s chair to the back. Janice, sit down in the corner. No, not at your desk. It\u0027s right in front where anyone walking by can see you. Sit in the back here. Patsy, get the blanket out of the closet. She can cover herself with that.",
        "Leon, go get the principal, tell him it\u0027s an emergency. Cover up Janice, you\u0027ll cause sinful thoughts. I wrapped the blanket around myself. I remembered asking my Sunday school teacher, how could it\u0027ve been all bad for Adam and Eve to eat the apple, since they got knowledge of good and evil, not just evil? And she said, they really just got knowledge of evil, everything had been good up to then. I pulled my feet up under the blanket."

            "What I learned at John\u0027s apartment about Dark Shadows is that the main point of it, the main pleasure of it, is watching things mess up. It\u0027s like watching car races for the car crashes. If the car crashes came every 10 minutes and nobody got hurt. This American Life producer Nancy Updike and I were in John\u0027s apartment for, I don\u0027t know, 10 minutes when a werewolf exited a scene, and through the open door, we could all witness this figure. Not a shadowy, mysterious figure from the year 1896, but instead--",
            "John is also sort of obsessed with trying to figure out exactly when the episodes were filmed. He claims that there is a point, in the 1969 episodes when, suddenly, all the characters started saying, groovy and freaky. By his calculations, the episodes that we\u0027re watching this night, were probably filmed in February 1969. One clue--",
            "It\u0027s kind of a character study, which actors decide to shoo the flies away, and which ones ignore them and continue bravely through the scenes.",
            "What\u0027s interesting about all this is that not only does it defy the way you\u0027re supposed to watch horror films, it defies the way you\u0027re supposed to watch drama. They do not suspend disbelief for one second. Instead, they construct elaborate fantasies, not about the characters, but about the actors who play the characters.",
            "Oh yeah.",
            "John\u0027s favorite actress is Grayson Hall, who plays Magda and Julia, and who, inexplicably, enters a lot of scenes sniffing the air, as if there is some bad odor that\u0027s never discussed or explained.",
            "What does she do after the show?",
            "You mean, she\u0027s good?",
            "Somewhere during the second episode of the night, I realized that, not only are these stories convoluted and hard to follow, they\u0027re incredibly boring, boring in a way that invites speculation and embroidery by the audience. For instance, the reliable father figure in this program is Barnabas Collins. And he\u0027s supposed to be this really great guy, and everybody loves him, and he\u0027s always jumping in and saving people. So why is he a vampire? Thax says it can be sort of disconcerting at times.",
            "Pretty soon after this, John declares that he has a Dark Shadows bloopers reel, full of funny accidents from the show. He spends the next hour searching among maybe 50 badly labeled tapes for it, popping in one obscure video after another. At one point he shows us a video that he made of a macrame clown sort of dancing in a darkened room to a mysterious song. He never finds the bloopers reel. And, at a certain point, I realize the entire evening has come to resemble a Dark Shadows episode itself, slow moving, full of accidents, convoluted, but really kind of fun.",
            "Thax flips to the Polish videos channel and talks about the Polish Beatles movie he once saw. And John explains his plan to attend his first Dark Shadows convention in a month or two. It\u0027s strange, John says, how a TV show that once seemed like the biggest thing in the world could be so obscure now. It makes you think about Madonna, and ER, and The X Files, and what anyone\u0027s going to remember 30 years from now.",
            "In a certain sense, things that are scary have a lot in common really with things that are funny. A, they both produce a physical reaction. And B, if something that is supposed to be scary fails to be scary, it\u0027s way more funny than something that\u0027s trying to be funny, if that makes sense.",
            "It sort of goes without saying, but this is our Halloween show, so I\u0027m going to say this anyway, that for John, and for Thax, and for Ericka, nothing about Dark Shadows has anything to do with things that are scary, with ghouls or spooks or Halloween. They could care less about Halloween.",
            "So what are you guys doing for Halloween?",
            "That\u0027s Thax. Here\u0027s Ericka.",
            "And finally, John, who hates Halloween, because it\u0027s a day when you\u0027re expected to be creative.",
            "This is the kind of moment they live for. Giant tears in the fabric of the show\u0027s fantasy. John says that modern TV shows and movies are way too slick. What he likes are things that are either old, or imperfect, or both. His house is filled with huge sofa-like paintings that he\u0027s picked up at garage sales, and recordings where you can hear things fall over in the studio. A fast paced, modern film like Independence Day exhausts him with its relentlessly high production values. Dark Shadows is more human scale."

But I want to ask it, and I\u0027m sure it\u0027s something that you might have thought about, given the way that you\u0027re costumed when you do this. What is a connection between sex and Halloween, between sex and scaring people?",

Shawna Kennedy plays Lady Cassandra at Haunted Verdun Manor, this huge, annual haunted house and more in Terrell, Texas, about 30 miles outside Dallas. Like Carol Estler, that woman who lives in a haunted house, Shawna is also a scientist, who found a new model for looking at the world. And Shawna Kennedy was always sort of shy. She didn\u0027t like scary movies. She didn\u0027t like horror novels. She\u0027d never been to a haunted house until last year. And last year, she made a big, big turnaround. Now, every night, she goes out to Haunted Verdun Manor to--",

            "Shawna says that she hated scary stuff until a few years ago, when she read this Stephen King book, Dance Macabre. Which makes the case that everybody needs a good scare now and then, and that all cultures have some version of ghost stories to do this. And reading that set her on this path that eventually led to her playing Lady Cassandra. And she says that playing Lady Cassandra sped up this process that she thinks would have happened anyway in her adult life, of learning to be more assertive. She says it\u0027s also given her a more complicated picture of herself than she had when she was a kid.",

            "The principal came in with Leon Anderson right behind him. What is it, Mrs. Wells? Is one of the children hurt? Mrs. Wells blushed. I guess it\u0027s not really an urgent emergency. I just felt we had to do something right away. Janice show him your costume. I couldn\u0027t believe it. She\u0027d said I was naked, and now she wanted me to show the principal and the whole class.",
            "Janice Ray, take that blanket off. I stood up and put the blanket on the chair behind me. I looked at the floor. After a minute, the principal said, well, there is a requirement that children wear shoes to school for health reasons, but if she stays off the playground, I don\u0027t think anything will happen in just one day. Janice, you tell your mother that your costume next year has to include shoes.",
            "Mrs. Wells grabbed his arm. Can I talk to you in the hall. I could see them talking outside the door as I put the blanket back around me. At first the principal looked like something was funny. But Mrs. Wells didn\u0027t calm down. Then he looked mad and did the rest of the talking.",
            "When Mrs. Wells came back in, she walked over to me and jerked the blanket away. Janice, give me the blanket. It seems I have overreacted. Her face was red, and she sounded like she was reciting a lesson. She didn\u0027t look at me. There\u0027s nothing inappropriate about your costume, although bare feet are extremely unhygienic. Go to your regular seat.",
            "Can I keep the blanket? No, you may not keep the blanket. There\u0027s absolutely nothing wrong with your costume. In fact, I think you should stand up in front of the class, so we\u0027ll all have a chance to look at it. It will be good for all of us to see what\u0027s acceptable, so we don\u0027t overreact again.",
            "For 15 minutes, she made me stand there, while the other kids looked at me and giggled behind their hands. I thought about all the temptresses I knew, about Bathsheba, and Delilah, and about Salome who danced nearly naked so they\u0027d cut off John the Baptist\u0027s head. I thought of the movie ads with Carol Baker in baby-doll pajamas sucking her thumb, that all the preachers were mad about. And I thought about Marilyn Monroe with her skirt blowing up, looking happy. And how everyone said, Joe DiMaggio had divorced her because her skirt blew up.",
            "And if part of me was excited that I could be a temptress like Eve, and Bathsheba, and Delilah, and Salome, and Carol Baker, and Marilyn Monroe, and maybe even like Elizabeth Taylor, most of me was horrified that I was sinful, and causing sin in others without even knowing how or why. It was just something I was, not something I did or even thought.",
            "I thought of Daddy seeing the picture of me, nearly naked, and I knew I had ruined everything. He wouldn\u0027t think I was a good sweet girl anymore. No one who knew about the costume would ever think I was a good girl again.",
            "I got to spend the whole day at school bare-legged, bare-footed, bare-shouldered, feeling totally naked. At recess and lunch, I rushed to the bathroom, locked myself in a stall, and pulled my feet up so their nakedness wouldn\u0027t show.",
            "The next time Daddy came to see us, I was embarrassed and stayed in my room. And six months later, when Jimmy [? Rigga ?] pulled me into an alley and kissed me, I let him, even though I liked Leon Anderson. And the next day, I saw Jimmy whispering to Leon and knew they were talking about me. And two years later, when the principal at my new school got the sixth grade girls alone in the closet and rubbed all up and down our fronts, I was the only one who didn\u0027t tell her mother. Because he was a deacon at the First Baptist Church, and I was a temptress.",
            "I was raised a Baptist, a Southern Baptist in west Texas. So I always knew that I was a sinner. But it wasn\u0027t until Halloween day in the fourth grade that I thought of myself as a sinful being. Before that, sin was something that could be overcome through hard work, prayer, reading the Bible, and thinking of a way out of coveting Tommy Sue Bailey\u0027s new Madame Alexander doll. Afterwards, I knew sin was part of me, in every molecule of my body, and I could never get rid of it.",
            "I was very excited about going to school on Halloween day. Mother had decided I could look like Daisy Mae Yokum, Lil\u0027 Abner\u0027s wife in the funny papers. She cut off and fringed a pair of old jeans. She found a peasant blouse, which we ripped, then pinned together with a diaper pin. She put my hair in pigtails and painted freckles on my nose. When she finished, she said, you look so cute. Let\u0027s take a picture to send your daddy.",
            "Daddy lived 80 miles away in Amarillo. He visited pretty often now, and he and mother wrote letters. I smiled my best smile for the picture, a smile that would show daddy what a good, pretty girl I was and, make him want to come home to stay.",
            "The next day, I went to school bare-legged, bare-footed, bare-shouldered, knowing that about half my friends would have ripped up one of their father\u0027s old dress shirts and come as bums, and the other half would have dug out old cowboy guns and cowboy hats and called that a costume. I thought I had a chance at the prize. I imagined my teacher\u0027s reaction. Janice, you\u0027re just the cutest thing, she\u0027d say, and so clever. Maybe she\u0027d hug me, like she did sometimes.",
            "Mrs. Wells was the first teacher I idolized. She was young and pretty, sweet and vivacious. She dressed in pastels and smelled like cotton candy. She had just married, and her husband was a part-time football coach and a part-time Baptist minister. For a while, I wished my mother would die and she\u0027d adopt me, but I realized that was a sinful thought. So I wished there was some kind of big sister organization, and she\u0027d be my big sister, and maybe my mother would decide I should live with her, because she lived closer to church or something.",
            "On Halloween, I stopped just inside the classroom door, waiting for her to see me, posing a little, excited for her reaction. When she turned, her mouth dropped open. Janice Ray Hopewell, what are you thinking of? That outfit is indecent, it\u0027s obscene. You look like a little temptress. Why, you\u0027re practically naked.",
            "A temptress? Naked? I didn\u0027t know I was naked. Then I thought of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and how they didn\u0027t know they were naked. I looked down at my feet and legs and saw them as the feet and legs of a naked temptress. While Mrs. Wells talked to me, she pulled Ernesto Rodriguez\u0027s chair to the back. Janice, sit down in the corner. No, not at your desk. It\u0027s right in front where anyone walking by can see you. Sit in the back here. Patsy, get the blanket out of the closet. She can cover herself with that.",
            "Leon, go get the principal, tell him it\u0027s an emergency. Cover up Janice, you\u0027ll cause sinful thoughts. I wrapped the blanket around myself. I remembered asking my Sunday school teacher, how could it\u0027ve been all bad for Adam and Eve to eat the apple, since they got knowledge of good and evil, not just evil? And she said, they really just got knowledge of evil, everything had been good up to then. I pulled my feet up under the blanket."

Each week on our program, we choose a theme, and invite a variety of writers and performers to take a whack at that theme with short stories, monologues, mini documentaries, whatever they can think of. And it is the Halloween edition of our program. And our theme is, things that are supposedly scary, but are not really scary. We are at Act [? Four. ?] And I actually got the idea to play you this next interview, the interview that will make up most of Act Four, when Shawna Kennedy, that Texas woman who dresses up as vampire, said the following thing to me, about her and her colleagues at Haunted Verdun Manor.",

            "In chalk?",

And that is the difference in reality, if you\u0027re in the gang, versus the way you see it if you\u0027re not in. I mean the way that you all saw what you were doing was, it\u0027s kind of fun. You guys laugh about it.",

            "Yeah, but I would think actually that could work to your advantage. You\u0027d say, yeah I did it. And I\u0027m sorry.",
            "See, but what they\u0027re saying to you, in a way, is even more interesting. What they\u0027re saying to you is, I\u0027m not so bad. I\u0027m not so bad. Look, what I\u0027m doing isn\u0027t so bad, because, look, you did it, everybody does it. You\u0027re telling me that I\u0027m bad. You\u0027re telling me the way I am is wrong. But I know in my heart that I\u0027m not that wrong.",

            "Even as you say it, your whole face turns into like a 14-year-old. I mean, you like shake your head, and like you kind of swagger. It\u0027s just like your whole personality just transforms.",

After all, what are most people really afraid of? Not goblins, not ghosts, most people are scared of armed urban teenagers who just don\u0027t care. They just don\u0027t care. And I would make the case, I believe that this fear, like the other fears in our program, is not totally justified. But you can judge for yourself. This is an interview with a young woman who was a gang member for years, who now counsels girls in Chicago gangs.",

            "No, there\u0027s kind of-- see, what happened was this. There was a teacher who was bothering somebody else. And what we were to do was go and scare this teacher. So what we did was we waited till everybody was gone and everything. And we broke inside the school. Then we went to her room and tore it up. And that was enough.",
            "On the chalkboard in--",
            "In chalk, because the pen wouldn\u0027t write on it. And we didn\u0027t have no spray paint. In chalk, and we did do a couple markers on the walls and stuff. And on her desk, we did a nice big one, to let her know like where it came from. Because he threatened her, and we were his threat backup. So she left him alone after that. So I guess it got our point across.",
            "This poor old lady, she didn\u0027t know anything. And she wasn\u0027t hassling him because she just wanted to hassle him. She was hassling him because he deserved it. Especially now that I work with children, I see that she was hassling him because he deserved to be hassled, because he wasn\u0027t doing what he was supposed to be doing. And yet, we just rocked her world. I mean, she was afraid for-- lord knows-- maybe years after that.",
            "She was. She was very scared. Because I went to that same school. And she was very afraid. When we went in that Monday, she was very afraid. I mean, we had tore everything up that was hers, everything. And it was cruel, real cruel. I think a lot of things we did were real cruel.",
            "When we were there, it wasn\u0027t like, shh, be quiet. No, it was like, throw everything, scream, laugh about it.",
            "It was a power trip. It\u0027s power. When you\u0027re 13, and you can walk down the street, and everybody looks at you like, there goes the Pope, that\u0027s a power trip.",
            "When you\u0027re on the street, some people can just walk up to somebody and just smack them, just smack the hell out of them. That would be it. But I was more like, what, you said something about me? You got something to do about that? I would lead it on.",
            "I could get my anger up, before I could muster up my courage, talk to them, argue with them, get your momentum up, get your anger. Get that nice wild flush in your face or something, and then like the nice crowd that\u0027s behind you saying, kick her ass, hit her, all this. And then you get this bold stance on you, and then you can hit someone. And you get all your nice anger out. But I couldn\u0027t just walk up and smack somebody.",
            "The girls who I see now are lost. They\u0027re so lost, they\u0027re like that all the time. They think they know everything. And they don\u0027t need know reason because they know everything. So all they need to do is go up there and do it. And one time my cousin said, well I just went up there and I clocked her. I said, you clocked her? You just clocked her? You didn\u0027t even say anything to her? She said, no, I didn\u0027t need to say anything to her. All I had to do was walk up and clock her. I said, so you walked up to her, you clocked her in the face, and that was it? She says yeah. And I\u0027m like, what were you thinking, when you walked-- She goes, I wasn\u0027t.",
            "I don\u0027t like some of what I did because when I try to reach out, and I try to tell the kids, you shouldn\u0027t do this because it\u0027s bad, and you\u0027ll hurt people. And they\u0027ll say, you did it.",
            "For some of them it does. For some of them it doesn\u0027t, because they can\u0027t get past-- because I can say to some of them, yes, I did. And this is how I feel about it now, and I regret it. But some of them, they can\u0027t get past the fact that I did do it, so that makes it correct. And every time you turn around they say, but you did it, but you did it. And it\u0027s not the fact that I did it, it\u0027s the fact that I did it, I regret it, and I got out. That\u0027s what I want to pass, that I got out, and I regret it.",
            "See, that\u0027s like, when I was doing all this. There was nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong. I mean, so what? So I went in there and I wrecked a classroom. So what? So I hit somebody in the head or the ear, they shouldn\u0027t have been messing with me. So what?",
            "That\u0027s why, in a way, it\u0027s hard for me to talk about this, because I do, I change. And I start the, so what, and I don\u0027t care.",
            "We lived on the corner of Beech and Spalding, right there, where they would kill people and hang them from the light post.",
            "They hung one person. And what it was, it was around Halloween. And what they did is they put jogging pants and filled it with newspaper, and they put a hood, and they put a banana hanging out of his [? virtuous ?] place. And they hung him from the lightpole. And nobody knew, because it looked like a dummy hanging there.",
            "It was a human being.",
            "Dead. Not alive anymore. See that was from a whole big war. And that was our victory or whatever with this person. And he had certain colors on, certain color jogging pants, certain color jogging shirt that he had on, certain color gloves, fingers bent down on the glove and all that stuff to represent.",
            "No, no, I didn\u0027t say his gang sign. They just had the gloves on it, and they had the glove taped down, holding upward our gang sign, not his. Not his-- ours up.",
            "No. I was too young.",
            "I didn\u0027t see them do it. I just knew about it.",
            "It was hilarious. I mean, to them. I was too young. I was maybe eight. I remember seeing it. I remember it there. I remember asking my mother why he\u0027s there.",
            "She said that she don\u0027t know, and she don\u0027t want to know.",
            "At age eight, I just kind of wondered why it was there, and how they got it up there. That was my whole big thing. I think that, as a child, you wonder those things. And I just kept wondering, how did they get it up there? And I just thought it was newspaper. And it was a person.",
            "It was up there a couple days. It was up there a couple days. Because it was like stenching, it smelled, and they cut it down. The police came, and they cut it down. And the banana had already fell off. And that was it. And nobody said anything. Nothing went out. There was no screams. There was no nothing. There was just somebody come, cut it down, picked it up, put it in a truck. Police came, scanned the area, came back once. That\u0027s it. Nothing was ever mentioned, nothing.",
            "I was 12. I was 74 pounds, maybe four foot in all. My mother thought I was her little angel. My grades were decent, my teachers liked me. I didn\u0027t get in very many fights at school. It was when I was out in my other neighborhood, this is where I became this big, bad, super person. And this is where I did all my damage. And why? Because I could.",
            "Me and a girlfriend went into a school, broke into a school, kind of destroyed some stuff. And we got recognized for it."

So I think this is really interesting. And when I was growing up, I was not allowed to scream. I was a very, very quiet, good child, so for me to scream, at all, in public is really unusual. So here I go. [SCREAM]",

            "But it\u0027s so hard to do here in the city. And I\u0027m out in a bungalow on the northwest side of Chicago. And the neighbors are probably about four to, I don\u0027t know, six feet away, or maybe 12 feet away with some walls in between. And I just feel like it wouldn\u0027t be appropriate to scream.",
            "So I wish I could be someone who could scream. When I was living in the mountains in California, I could sing my screams, and just do it. It was great. It was a wonderful way to express myself and to release a lot of things that I was holding in. But I can\u0027t do it in the city. So that\u0027s what I wanted to say. Maybe I\u0027ll call back another time and say stuff too. OK, thank you, bye bye.",
