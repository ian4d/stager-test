        "Tuesday morning, 9:30 AM. The Chicken Alarm in my Chicken Cave goes off 30 minutes late, which makes me late for my annual physical at my doctor, DuPont Chopper. I didn\u0027t want to be late, since it was my first in 30 years. 9:50 AM. I get a flat as I pull the Chicken Coupe out of the Chicken Garage. So I take the convenient number 32 bus, which drops me off only 14 blocks from the doctor\u0027s office.",
        "--says the doctor. And I say, \"I know. I\u0027m sorry. All the air went out of my whatchmacallit.\"",

        "12:00 noon. I return to the Chicken Cave. And there, in the chicken mirror-- augh!-- I see something horrible. No, not my ugly face, my own mortality. I ask myself why it never stared me in the face before. After all, I\u0027ve been fighting crime and/or evil for over 30 years, pursuing it down streets and allies and sewers and other picturesque places. And my mortality never came up even once.",
        "1:40 PM. I go see the police commissioner and share with him the doctor\u0027s diagnosis. After all, he is my closest friend. And if I can\u0027t tell him the bad news, who can I tell? So I give him a new coloring book I bought for him and tell him my sad news. And he says--",
        "So what do you think commissioner?",
        "What I just shared with you.",
        "About the diagnosis and the need to alter my lifestyle.",
        "OK.",

        "Wednesday morning, 9:30 AM. My Chicken Alarm goes off a half hour late for my geriatric counseling appointment. Tire still flat. So I take the convenient number 18 bus. And that leaves me off only 28 blocks from the counselor\u0027s office.",

        "2:00 AM, next morning. I can\u0027t sleep, and I sip warm milk in the Chicken Cave. What to do? I\u0027m on the horns of a dilemma. Heavy concrete hauler? Fold napkins in nouveau Italian-Chinese restaurant specializing in pizza and light salads? Or challenge the fates?",
        "8:00 AM. I stand on the roof of Midland City\u0027s tallest skyscraper, four dizzy stories high. I hurl a challenge to the fates. This is the winged warrior, fates. I shall go on fighting crime and/or evil. I don\u0027t care that my bad cholesterol is bad, that--",

When I was a kid listening to the radio in Baltimore, I heard this stuff, and really, Chickenman, until the time I was 13 years old, and The Tooth Fairy, another series that Dick Orkin did. And then occasionally, you would hear these commercials for Time magazine or other stuff.",

And I, like many people who got into radio in the years that followed, spent the early part of my career in radio trying to imitate that sound and then giving up because of the utter futility of that.",
        "And so we are very, very pleased. All of that is a way of saying we are very, very pleased. We, the corporate we, I and the little production staff here at Your Radio Playhouse, we are very pleased to be able to bring the first new Chickenman episode written since 1969, the first full episode written since 1969. You know, Chickenman is getting up in years. And no one appears to be more aware of that than his creator.",

        "This is Luis Rodriguez. And I\u0027m going to read my poem, \"The Rooster Who Thought it Was a Dog.\" Echo Park mornings came on the wings of a rooster\u0027s gnawing squawk. This noise, unfortunately, also brought in the afternoon, evenings, and most hours of the day. The rooster had no sense of time, nor any desire to commit to one. He\u0027d cock-a-doodle whenever he had the notion.",
        "[MUSIC PLAYING - \"A CHICKEN AIN\u0027T NOTHIN\u0027 BUT A BIRD\" BY CAB CALLOWAY]",
        "For late sleepers, day sleepers, or your plain, ordinary, run of the mill night sleepers, annoyance had this rooster\u0027s beak. It was enough to drive one crazy. Often, I open my back window that faced the alley just across from the backyard where the rooster made his home. \"Shut up, or I\u0027ll blow your stinking brains out,\" I\u0027d yell. Great communication technique.",
        "It worked on the brats next door, but the rooster never flinched. With calm aplomb, it continued to squawk. For one thing, the rooster never gave out a bona fide cock-a-doodle. It sort of shouted it out.",
        "It happened that the rooster lived with three dogs, a German Shepherd and two mutts. The dogs barked through their existence. They barked at everything in sight. I finally concluded that rooster thought it was a dog. Somehow, I didn\u0027t mind the dogs barking. But when a rooster barks, that\u0027s murder.",
        "In fact, I often saw it running alongside the dogs as they raced across the dirt yard, barking at passing cars or people. If the dogs went left, the rooster went left. They\u0027d go right, and dang if that rooster didn\u0027t go right as well. Now I don\u0027t know if this is a regular condition for roosters.",
        "I thought I had a story for the Weekly World News. I could see it now. \"The Rooster Who Thinks it\u0027s a Dog.\" Who knows what rooster dementia we had here? And whether the rooster chased cats up trees or pissed on fire hydrants, this wasn\u0027t clear.",
        "But once I grasped the heart of the matter, I began to see the rooster in another light. I felt sorry for this fowl with an identity problem. And I wondered how it must react when its owners threw chicken bones to the dogs. Would it nibble on the remains of its favorite hen? I shuddered at the thought.",
        "Yet despite the revelation of the rooster\u0027s bark, the problem of sleep didn\u0027t end. Then one day, a new neighbor, a young lady, who often drank herself to bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. She became somewhat of a local hero.",
        "I must say, though, it was an unfitting end for the bird. But I suppose one can tolerate barking dogs. But barking roosters? That\u0027s another matter altogether."

        "July 19, 1992. This afternoon, at the 26th Street Flea Market, I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. Not shop like grocery shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name.",
        "I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. \"That\u0027s collectible,\" the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?",
        "Last weekend at the flea market, I saw this thing, a taxidermied turkey\u0027s head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You\u0027d think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself.",
        "I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, \"I know. I\u0027ll take the turkey\u0027s head and attach it to the foot.\" Why would you do that? Or more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?",
        "I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. \"$45,\" the dealer said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air, and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. \"All right,\" she said, \"$35. $30.\" But she could have gone up. \"All right. $85. $120. $370.\"",
        "I had no choice but to follow wherever she led me. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all.",
        "I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey\u0027s head, and nothing else mattered. Tomorrow, what\u0027s that? Yesterday doesn\u0027t count. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own.",
        "On the way home I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, \"I\u0027ll give you one hundred-- no, $500,000 if you can guess what I\u0027ve got in this paper sack.\" And I swear that not one of them could have come up with the right answer. I walked home 30 blocks, looking everyone square in the eye and thinking, \"Sucker.\""

      "statements": [
        "I\u0027m Julie Showalter. I grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. \"The night 3,000 turkeys died.\" The day before the night that 3,000 turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range.",
        "We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with this legs, forcing them into the sun.",
        "Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time Daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor\u0027s farm, into the road.",
        "We didn\u0027t own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits.",
        "With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of Daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him any time we weren\u0027t in school, all for no pay. And if we weren\u0027t paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised.",
        "It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister, Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration.",
        "As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on.",
        "You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that? Or you may think that I\u0027m exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or that any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. \"I couldn\u0027t afford n------,\" he told my sister Billie. \"So I had daughters.\"",
        "At 6 o\u0027clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low in the sky behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up. We ate supper. And we went to bed. That\u0027s the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died.",
        "At midnight, Mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed Daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them, one after the other.",
        "When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, \"Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?\" The answer is yes, some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that\u0027s not how 3,000 die in one night.",
        "This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures.",
        "They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other, trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate.",
        "We called it piling. It wasn\u0027t unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn\u0027t someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door.",
        "But this was worse than any pile we\u0027d seen, turkeys who\u0027d never spent a night outdoors panicked by thunder, lightning, and rain in sheets. All we could do is pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group.",
        "After a while standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing more, you don\u0027t know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don\u0027t care. Maybe we saved some.",
        "The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days.",
        "Daddy decided we would herd them to the range. It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute, into the pen.",
        "And that\u0027s the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. \"Let\u0027s work straight through,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll be done by 10:00.\"",
        "By the time the turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles, and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day.",
        "You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn\u0027t know that then.",
        "We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight.",
        "The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I\u0027ve seen turkeys clamber against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I\u0027ve seen them rush toward a screaming child, trying to kill it. And I\u0027ve seen them run from a screaming child, spooked and terrified.",
        "These turkeys didn\u0027t want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in. But there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight which turkeys would not touch."

But I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it\u0027s very easy to demonstrate those feelings. It\u0027s not as easy to demonstrate those feelings toward my sister, just because we never got in the habit of it.",
            "Well, the really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Duki. But I think kind of a big chunk. It definitely gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn\u0027t have otherwise.",

            "Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about eight and I was about 10. And when he first arrived he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. And he had a cape on and black kind of villain/hero goggles. I guess we\u0027d call it hero goggles. And I think he was, because there was an S on his cape, I\u0027m sure he was supposed to be Superduck or something.",
            "And he\u0027s a puppet. He lost the outfit pretty quickly, and he went naked. And then he became Ashley\u0027s vehicle for torturing me.",

            "Ashley\u0027s very considerate. She\u0027s very considerate and kind and thoughtful, and very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very concerned about if other people are happy or if someone else doesn\u0027t feel good. And Duki has this total \"What\u0027s for lunch?\" attitude, like \"What\u0027s in it for me?\" in your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.",
            "He\u0027s just this indomitable spirit. Well, lately, he\u0027s at U Mich with my sister. And he tried out for the football team. They\u0027ve got a good football team there.",
            "And he said he didn\u0027t make it. But he said it was because they thought he\u0027d be more valuable in the band. And they got a good band, too. So apparently, he goes to band practice every day.",

            "Really, I feel like-- it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki, and that it would be a big, empty hole in the world. He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking.",

He thinks he\u0027s really good-looking and strong, and that he\u0027s really smart and has a lot of friends.",

            "In Danielle\u0027s house, ever since she was a girl, when dinner comes, sometimes they serve a meal that might look familiar to you. Here\u0027s the main course. On a big platter, picture drumsticks, white breast meat, golden brown skin.",
            "Really?",
            "Yeah. That period that you\u0027re describing, when do you mean?",
            "And they would only communicate through the duck?",
            "What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with Duki?",
            "Well, I did finally snag an interview with Duki by calling Ashley.",
            "Is Duki still up for this?",
            "He just got back from a party?",
            "OK. Well, could you get him?",
            "Hey, Duki?",
            "I\u0027m just fine.",
            "Yes, indeed. In the late 1960s, the winged warrior Chickenman struck terror in the hearts of evildoers everywhere, on Chicago radio first and then across the nation. Tonight, we\u0027re going to bring you a historic first, the first new episode since 1969, later. That will be later, later.",
            "Long time no see, back at you. And welcome to our little radio program.",
            "Well, we actually have a number of different people?",
            "They\u0027re just like Tom Cruise, yes. Yeah. Now, Duki, I was talking to Danielle for our radio program and had her come on and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that when she was younger, in order to discipline her, if she was doing something that you didn\u0027t like, you could pretty much control her with something called \"nose squeaks.\"",
            "Of Danielle.",
            "And would she move?",
            "See, because we\u0027re savvy broadcasters here. Even though it\u0027s public broadcasting, we\u0027re going to make you wait \u0027til later in the show for that. We know many of you are tuning in for that, and we\u0027re going to make you wait.",
            "Now if Ashley would tell her, if Ashley would sit down on the couch and say to Danielle, \"Move the pork,\" what would the effect of that be?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is there anything about the life of a duck that perhaps you could tell our radio audience that we might not know? I\u0027m sure that you know much more about it than we do.",
            "You\u0027re not in touch with the whole scene, yeah.",
            "OK, to return to our story. Danielle\u0027s family. The power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it--",
            "Well, the story of a 26-year-old graduate student who talks like a duck brings us naturally to the subject of Chickenman. Chickenman first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969. And nearly every day, there would be a new episode for three years. These are short, little two-minute things, starting on WCFL here in our beloved Chicago.",
            "And after that, Chickenman appeared on over 1,500 radio stations across the country, around the world. According to the people who syndicate it these are the numbers. They say it\u0027s been translated into German, Dutch, and Swedish. It is still on the air, they say, in several dozen markets, making it one of the longest-running radio features anywhere.",
            "Chickenman began years before National Public Radio existed. It will probably continue years after we are gone. Like the mighty cockroach, like, I don\u0027t know, the bagel, like Hamlet, Chickenman endures, will endure.",
            "Coming up later in the show, we\u0027ll have the first new Chickenman episode since 1969. Have we mentioned this enough in the show? Should we just mention it every time? Every time we open the mike, I should just mention that? It was written especially for our broadcast by Dick Orkin, the voice of Chickenman. But before we hear that, let\u0027s just hear what all the fuss was about.",
            "That\u0027s right. And they call it this for a reason. And the reason has to do with this stuffed hand puppet called Duki.",
            "A little background, Danielle is 28 years old, editor at Details magazine in New York City, a very fashionable magazine. Her sister, Ashley, two years younger, now a graduate student at the University of Michigan. And Duki has been in the family since they were children.",
            "The all-new Chickenman, coming up at the end of our show. But next, a real-life story of real poultry and a real poultry farm. Stay with us, won\u0027t you?",
            "Somebody carves this. Perhaps on a holiday, there\u0027s stuffing and cranberry relish on the side. And in Danielle\u0027s family, they have a name for this meal. As she told me on the phone recently, the name for this meal is--",
            "Now it is not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle pretty much would dominate Ashley. Danielle always got her way, except, except when Duki was around.",
            "And basically what would happen is Ashley would channel-- that\u0027s kind of an anachronism to use that word in this context-- but Ashley would channel Duki\u0027s voice. She would speak as Duki. She would produce the Duki-like voice. And Duki was sarcastic and selfish and bossy. Duki would insult and tease Danielle and give her painful nose squeaks.",
            "Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley\u0027s personality.",
            "He\u0027s boastful and vain.",
            "Nationally ranked.",
            "18 years after Duki arrived in the Mattoon household, I can say, I think fairly accurately, that the fluffy whiteness is long gone. \"Fluffy\" is not a word-- you would never use that word with Duki anymore. Nor is two-eyed, actually, if I remember correctly.",
            "Very tattered.",
            "OK, I have been at Danielle\u0027s house sometimes and witnessed the following scene. Picture this. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks, picks up the phone, calls her sister Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, \"Can you put Duki on the line?\" And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the line. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That\u0027s the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied.",
            "So I hope that it\u0027s becoming clear why, when you eat dinner in the home of Danielle\u0027s family, if they are serving some kind of poultry, chicken or turkey, if you ask anyone in the family what\u0027s for dinner, they\u0027ll tell you--",
            "Right. And the rationale for that is what?",
            "Got that?",
            "It freaks him out, though-- you don\u0027t like him to know that perhaps some birds are, in fact, eaten?",
            "Now I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this show. So a few weeks ago, I contacted Danielle\u0027s sister, Ashley. And I asked her if Duki could come on the air.",
            "And I didn\u0027t get a call back. I got an answer back by electronic mail that for Duki to appear, I would have to call someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley\u0027s mom. And when I talked with Danielle, I asked her about this.",
            "I\u0027ve been informed that the only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu? Do I have that name right?",
            "Yona Lu is--",
            "Anything special that I should say to Yona Lu?",
            "Hey, Mrs. Mattoon?",
            "It\u0027s Ira Glass.",
            "Mrs. Mattoon, here\u0027s why I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio about Duki.",
            "Duki. And I contacted your daughter, Ashley. And she said that for me to book Duki on to my radio show, I was going to first need to contact Yona Lu.",
            "Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it is Your Radio Playhouse, a special program tonight on the wonders of \"fish.\" Actually, we can say the word here. And the word would be \"poultry.\"",
            "And that I needed to do that through you.",
            "Who is Yona Lu?",
            "I don\u0027t know, actually. I mean, we--",
            "Well, so what do I do now? I was told to contact you if I wanted to get in touch with Yona Lu in order to book Duki. What do I do next?",
            "That\u0027s the whole idea. I want to book Duki for the show, for an interview.",
            "We are in the interregnum of poultry. We stand at this moment between the poultry of Thanksgiving and the poultry of Christmas. This is the peak poultry moment in our American year. Something like a fourth, a little less than a fourth of all the turkey consumed in this country consumed during these few weeks.",
            "Will Yona Lu want to discuss terms or something?",
            "So what\u0027s going to happen? All right. Should I call you back?",
            "You\u0027ll just go in and check.",
            "Should I wait?",
            "All right, I\u0027ll wait.",
            "And to honor that, we bring you this evening an odd variety of stories and things you would not hear elsewhere, as we always do of course. Things you not would hear elsewhere-- just transpose the words of that sentence yourselves at home. I\u0027m not going to do that for you-- about turkeys, chickens, ducks, fowl of all kind and their mysterious hold over us.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It\u0027s just radio.",
            "No, no one\u0027s going to be on TV. No, it\u0027s strictly radio.",
            "Well, I am Ira Glass. A Chicago poet actually named Jim Banks suggested a special name for this special poultry edition of this Your Radio Playhouse. His suggestion, \"A Poultry Slam,\" after, of course, the poetry slams the we hold here in Chicago, in the venerable paneled darkness of the Green Mill Cocktail Lounge each Sunday. Coming up this hour, David Sedaris, Luis Rodriguez, and other writers and radio heroes. And of course, of course, of course, what poultry-positive radio program could be complete without--",
            "What if it were TV?",
            "OK. In Danielle\u0027s family-- I guess you\u0027re figuring this out. There\u0027s Duki. There\u0027s Yona Lu. And then there are four or five other characters, Therese-- I can never keep all their names straight-- who live in this world that\u0027s fleshed out with a lot of vivid detail and drama. They have a club called The Smart Set, and people are forever falling in and out of favor with The Smart Set.",
            "Anyway, there are jealousies. There are rivalries. People fight for favors and treats and invitations to ice cream socials. And each of the characters corresponds to some stuffed doll that Danielle and Ashley received as children.",
            "Though a few months ago, Danielle and Ashley were talking. And they realized that one of the characters, Guy Frank, didn\u0027t seem to correspond to any particular doll that they could remember. Where did he come from?",
            "They attempted to recall this. And then one of them did. Guy Frank is Duki\u0027s imaginary friend. Duki is such a fully realized imaginary friend that he has his own imaginary friend.",
            "As you might imagine, not everyone in the family takes all this so lightly. Danielle\u0027s father, for example, was never too keen on it."

            "I\u0027m Julie Showalter. I grew up on a turkey farm in southwest Missouri. \"The night 3,000 turkeys died.\" The day before the night that 3,000 turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range.",
            "We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with this legs, forcing them into the sun.",
            "Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time Daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor\u0027s farm, into the road.",
            "We didn\u0027t own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits.",
            "With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of Daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him any time we weren\u0027t in school, all for no pay. And if we weren\u0027t paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised.",
            "It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister, Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration.",
            "As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on.",
            "You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that? Or you may think that I\u0027m exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or that any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. \"I couldn\u0027t afford n------,\" he told my sister Billie. \"So I had daughters.\"",
            "At 6 o\u0027clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low in the sky behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up. We ate supper. And we went to bed. That\u0027s the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died.",
            "At midnight, Mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed Daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them, one after the other.",
            "When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, \"Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?\" The answer is yes, some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that\u0027s not how 3,000 die in one night.",
            "This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. When they are 16 weeks old, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures.",
            "They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other, trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate.",
            "We called it piling. It wasn\u0027t unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn\u0027t someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door.",
            "But this was worse than any pile we\u0027d seen, turkeys who\u0027d never spent a night outdoors panicked by thunder, lightning, and rain in sheets. All we could do is pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group.",
            "After a while standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing more, you don\u0027t know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don\u0027t care. Maybe we saved some.",
            "The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days.",
            "Daddy decided we would herd them to the range. It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute, into the pen.",
            "And that\u0027s the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. \"Let\u0027s work straight through,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll be done by 10:00.\"",
            "By the time the turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles, and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day.",
            "You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn\u0027t know that then.",
            "We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight.",
            "The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I\u0027ve seen turkeys clamber against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I\u0027ve seen them rush toward a screaming child, trying to kill it. And I\u0027ve seen them run from a screaming child, spooked and terrified.",
            "These turkeys didn\u0027t want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in. But there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight which turkeys would not touch."

This noise, unfortunately, also brought in the afternoon, evenings, and most hours of the day. The rooster had no sense of time, nor any desire to commit to one. He\u0027d cock-a-doodle whenever he had the notion.",

            "For late sleepers, day sleepers, or your plain, ordinary, run of the mill night sleepers, annoyance had this rooster\u0027s beak. It was enough to drive one crazy. Often, I open my back window that faced the alley just across from the backyard where the rooster made his home. \"Shut up, or I\u0027ll blow your stinking brains out,\" I\u0027d yell. Great communication technique.",
            "It worked on the brats next door, but the rooster never flinched. With calm aplomb, it continued to squawk. For one thing, the rooster never gave out a bona fide cock-a-doodle. It sort of shouted it out.",
            "It happened that the rooster lived with three dogs, a German Shepherd and two mutts. The dogs barked through their existence. They barked at everything in sight. I finally concluded that rooster thought it was a dog. Somehow, I didn\u0027t mind the dogs barking. But when a rooster barks, that\u0027s murder.",
            "In fact, I often saw it running alongside the dogs as they raced across the dirt yard, barking at passing cars or people. If the dogs went left, the rooster went left. They\u0027d go right, and dang if that rooster didn\u0027t go right as well. Now I don\u0027t know if this is a regular condition for roosters.",
            "I thought I had a story for the Weekly World News. I could see it now. \"The Rooster Who Thinks it\u0027s a Dog.\" Who knows what rooster dementia we had here? And whether the rooster chased cats up trees or pissed on fire hydrants, this wasn\u0027t clear.",
            "But once I grasped the heart of the matter, I began to see the rooster in another light. I felt sorry for this fowl with an identity problem. And I wondered how it must react when its owners threw chicken bones to the dogs. Would it nibble on the remains of its favorite hen? I shuddered at the thought.",
            "Yet despite the revelation of the rooster\u0027s bark, the problem of sleep didn\u0027t end. Then one day, a new neighbor, a young lady, who often drank herself to bliss, got a gun and blew the rooster away. She became somewhat of a local hero.",
            "I must say, though, it was an unfitting end for the bird. But I suppose one can tolerate barking dogs. But barking roosters? That\u0027s another matter altogether."

            "In the meantime, my friend Verta tells this story. Verta, Vertamae Grosvenor, is a National Public Radio commentator, host of an NPR show called Seasonings. Anyway, back in 1970, she published a cookbook. And she was interviewed about it on television by Barbara Walters.",
            "Yeah?",

            "And Verta tells her, \"You can tell by the sound.\" Ms. Walters gives her this look which says, basically, \"Give me a break,\" and quickly cuts to a commercial. And Verta says that\u0027s always people\u0027s reaction.",

But it turned out to be hard without those other cues. And I guess I\u0027ve learned that the chicken is a tricky thing. Chicken is tricky. Chicken is craftier than we usually give it credit for.",
            "So you have been claiming for years that you can tell if the chicken\u0027s done purely by the sound. And so to determine if that\u0027s true, we\u0027ve decided to conduct a little radio experiment here, with your permission. The other night, we fried a chicken, and we recorded it at different stages of its frying. And we are going to play you now four different moments in the frying of the chicken that we\u0027ve changed the order of.",

            "I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. \"That\u0027s collectible,\" the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?",
            "Last weekend at the flea market, I saw this thing, a taxidermied turkey\u0027s head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You\u0027d think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself.",
            "I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, \"I know. I\u0027ll take the turkey\u0027s head and attach it to the foot.\" Why would you do that? Or more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?",
            "I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. \"$45,\" the dealer said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air, and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. \"All right,\" she said, \"$35. $30.\" But she could have gone up. \"All right. $85. $120. $370.\"",
            "I had no choice but to follow wherever she led me. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all.",
            "I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey\u0027s head, and nothing else mattered. Tomorrow, what\u0027s that? Yesterday doesn\u0027t count. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own.",
            "On the way home I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, \"I\u0027ll give you one hundred-- no, $500,000 if you can guess what I\u0027ve got in this paper sack.\" And I swear that not one of them could have come up with the right answer.

When I was a kid listening to the radio in Baltimore, I heard this stuff, and really, Chickenman, until the time I was 13 years old, and The Tooth Fairy, another series that Dick Orkin did. And then occasionally, you would hear these commercials for Time magazine or other stuff.",

And I, like many people who got into radio in the years that followed, spent the early part of my career in radio trying to imitate that sound and then giving up because of the utter futility of that.",

We, the corporate we, I and the little production staff here at Your Radio Playhouse, we are very pleased to be able to bring the first new Chickenman episode written since 1969, the first full episode written since 1969. You know, Chickenman is getting up in years. And no one appears to be more aware of that than his creator.",
