And the way it was explained to me, they were having this conversation, and it was one of these conversations that, if you\u0027ve ever been in a couple with a big age difference, maybe you\u0027ve taken part in, he was saying basically, what can you see in me? You know, you are so young and energetic and I\u0027m this older person. I\u0027m so much more serious."

You are Phil Jackson. You ground me. I am wild. You make everything all right. And that\u0027s the way it is right now in Chicago, where I speak to you from right now. Our historic championship basketball team, the Chicago Bulls, is not just the winningest team of all time, with 72 regular season wins, now hurtling through the NBA playoffs. What\u0027s happened here in Chicago is that the Bulls are now the lens through which we view all of our experiences. They\u0027re the benchmark against we\u0027re measuring everything in our lives. They\u0027ve become our reality."

At nights in Chicago, now the Hancock building, which towers over the city, is lit a bright Bulls-red. Bulls posters and souvenirs and caps and T-shirts are for sale in every video storage and corner drugstore, in bars, everywhere. It\u0027s like living in China during the cultural revolution. Slogans and propaganda, everywhere, all uniting us as one people. The name United Center was never more appropriate than now. There we are, united behind the vanguard-- Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil, Luke, our vanguard, and all the others."

And I know actually that many people who have never heard our program before around the country are hearing us for the first time today. So a quick word of explanation, the idea of this radio show is to document what\u0027s going on around the country, in these United States, using all the different forms of radio storytelling that we can think of, including documentary, monologues, found tapes, just whatever we can think of. Each week, we choose a theme. And our theme for this hour is basketball-- stories of people who have a basketball jones of one sort or another."

And there\u0027s Michael Jordan in my office. And it somehow developed, while I was having a conversation with Michael Jordan about the audit, and I wasn\u0027t completely prepared, but he knew I wasn\u0027t ready, and he decided that, in exchange for oral sexual favors, he would make sure we passed the audit. And I had a conversation with my boss about it, and my boss was, like, \"Well, I can\u0027t really tell you that you should do this, but it\u0027s Michael Jordan, how bad can it be?\" And we passed the audit.

There\u0027s a mini refrigerator, though Beau and I didn\u0027t have the nerve to look inside. Beau did take a peek at the private bathroom and saw Scottie\u0027s toilet.

When you go inside Niketown, there are 18 separate pavilions, each with its own kind of sight and sound environment, like a real basketball court floor, and the sounds of squeaking sneakers on hardwood in the area that sells basketball stuff, the sound of tennis balls being hit in another area where they sell tennis stuff."

Items move from the fourth-floor storeroom to the cashier stations through clear plastic tubes rimmed with green neon that suggest, as they are meant to, the cartoon future of the Jetsons. The direct purchase of goods is designed to appear to be an afterthought. The retail areas are cramped compared to the open atriums designed for the display of art and statuary. And the store\u0027s design requires every entering customer to be distracted by considerable aesthetics before reaching any locale where Nike items can actually be purchased. There are whimsical, anarchic features everywhere in Niketown. Tropical fish swim in a 22-foot, 1,000-gallon tank behind the hiking shoe display. A bank of nine television screens embedded beneath the floor nearby flashes images of glimmering swimming pools and waterfalls. It is seductive and very effective at creating sales.\""

        "When I met up with my friend Mary to talk about basketball, she was having some trouble with her trophies. She\u0027d just moved to a new apartment, and her new place was small, so small that a bunch of high school trophies would just dominate any room they were in. She had the trophies in a box in the living room, and we sat on the floor pulling out fake silver statuettes of girls in coolots, reaching ever upward, hopeful and fit, like in Soviet propaganda posters.",
        "Sure. Grab that baby by the base.",
        "Yeah, it is truly-- It\u0027s so damned--",
        "Will you give it to me?",
        "I love it. I want it.",
        "Oh, sure. Oh, sure. I mean, if you\u0027re a 13-year-old girl, you don\u0027t want to be walking home with that. You want that.",
        "--that\u0027s a trophy.",
        "You don\u0027t want a tree slice.",
        "Was that something that you all discussed?",
        "Mary handed me the wood-sliced trophy. And when I reached to touch the stick figure, I realized that one of its feet was on a pivot, so I could actually make it go in for the dunk. Once I discovered this, it was impossible not to do it over and over and over. The trophy was completely hypnotizing, a disturbing artifact from an artistic period best forgotten.",
        "Who knew there was even a genre of late-\u002770s Catholic textbook art worlds. You know, that whole scene.",
        "I need to walk away.",
        "It makes you want to grit your teeth.",
        "As a kid, Mary played basketball mostly with her older brother, Daniel. The two of them roamed around the city together looking for pickup games whenever they could, all summer, every weekend, even at night, because the court down the street had lights. It was a way to get out of the house, to escape the chaos of 11 kids in a working class Irish family in a too-small house on the edge of Northeast Philadelphia. Basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense. And home was a place where you could get hit for no reason, or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal. Mary remembered being hungry a lot growing up, a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school.",
        "Another good thing about basketball was that it was cheap. Mary bought the family a rim and a basketball for their backyard when she was only seven or eight, using her first communion money, $65 in $5 increments from everyone in her huge family. The only equipment she really needed and could never afford were good shoes.",
        "She always had those supermarket checkout line shoes with the hard plastic soles that were completely embarrassing, of course, but also had no grippability. So she would be running down a court and go sliding and be called for traveling. So one year, she got up the courage to ask a girl down the block for her old shoes.",
        "We talked for two hours about basketball. And we kept returning to the dunk, that special thing boys can do and girls can\u0027t. And the cruelty of the dunk on that wood-sliced trophy, a dunk by a stick figure made of nails, driving home their 18-year-old sense of frustration. They could be the best ball handlers, the best guards, and it didn\u0027t matter worth a damn because they couldn\u0027t dunk. All of that captured forever in the last trophy most of them would ever receive.",
        "What were the circumstances?",
        "I\u0027m so glad you asked.",
        "Wow."

Luckily for us, we all thought, well, you know, we\u0027re really some of the best players on the face of the Earth. You know, when you\u0027re a 16-year-old girl who\u0027s playing at a tough Catholic league school, like you think, yeah, we\u0027re good enough. I\u0027m just as good as Maurice Cheeks. And you know, the Doctor would like to play with me, Doctor J. And we could attribute our lack of success in the NBA to the fact that we were girls, soon to be women, who would never dunk. And that\u0027s all that was keeping us from it.",

And they especially directed it to our family and all the other families that had a lot of kids in them, that our parents were saints because they worked so hard to provide for us. So I thought that I was just extraordinarily greedy that I would want to eat when I was hungry. I think that playing basketball was a way to say, you know, if I could use my body in this way, that got me status and attention and a certain amount of prestige, then my body was OK in a way, even though it was-- I mean, I was way too skinny when I was a kid.",

And in our neighborhood, there is the practice of throwing your old sneakers up over the telephone wires when you\u0027re done with them. And most of them were hardly worn out at all. I mean, a lot of them, you could see that there was tread missing, but it\u0027s not like you had ripped through the top of them.",

I thought that it was a little bit weird that I would ask somebody for their used shoes, but we had other clothes that were used from other people. And she was tough, and she kind of had this-- she seemed like she\u0027d be the kind of person that could keep something like that to her and would know what it meant. And she did. She never told anybody, except, of course, the most important person that she shouldn\u0027t have told, her mother.",

I\u0027m sure that they all had this understanding of themselves, like you don\u0027t insult one of your peers by giving their kids your crappy shoes even though they\u0027re better than the crappy shoes that you bought for them.",
        "But there were always really beautiful sneakers hanging up on the wires, and there was no way to get them, no way at all. They just floated up there. And you know what? I think that\u0027s when I decided that platonic idealism was true. There really was a perfect thing that I would never experience, at least while I played in that Catholic league. And only I could see them for what they were. They only saw worn-out tread. I saw a season of unforeseen high statistics.",
        "I think it was really kind of thoughtless in the way that thoughtless things can sometimes have a really nasty edge to them. And we had a woman on our team who was African-American who was, like 6\u00273, and she couldn\u0027t dunk the ball. You know what I mean? It was like there was no one that we knew who could dunk the ball, not a single woman that we knew. And we knew some tall women. We knew women who were in college. I mean, I used to have a dream, a recurring dream that I dunked the ball.",
        "I was on the baseline.",
        "I was in the same position all the time. And it wasn\u0027t like kinds of dunks that you see in real life, like that even the best players can do. This was a spectacular dunk, because I didn\u0027t just get my hands up over the rim, I sailed over the rim with my feet and got above the basket and just slammed the ball down through the thing. My whole body was above the rim.",

        "Maybe five or six months ago, I was at a really stressed out time at work preparing for an audit. I had a dream during that period that the auditing team showed up at my office as planned, only the chief auditor was Michael Jordan. I was really nervous and stressed out. And there\u0027s Michael Jordan in my office. And it somehow developed, while I was having a conversation with Michael Jordan about the audit, and I wasn\u0027t completely prepared, but he knew I wasn\u0027t ready, and he decided that, in exchange for oral sexual favors, he would make sure we passed the audit. And I had a conversation with my boss about it, and my boss was, like, \"Well, I can\u0027t really tell you that you should do this, but it\u0027s Michael Jordan, how bad can it be?\" And we passed the audit. One of the other really funny things about this is that it\u0027s Scottie Pippen who I find absolutely just adorable, not Michael."

        "This year, as every one in the world now knows, the Bulls won 72 games and lost a mere 10, making them, numerically at least, the most successful team of all time. It is also the year I, without meaning to, traded in the great and noble pleasure of publicly hating the Bulls in every bar, tavern, and speak easy of this beer-swilling town for the rather common, tawdry pleasure of joining the masses in whooping up every Jordan jumper, Pippen put-back, and Kukoc [UNINTELLIGIBLE].",
        "And why? Well, for one thing, three of my old Pistons have joined the current version of the Bulls. John \"Spider\" Salley, who can still block a shot with the best of them. James \"Buddha\" Edwards, who, at the age of 40, still successfully practices his specialty, the fade away chip shot from the paint. And of course, Dennis \"The Worm\" Rodman. I\u0027ve always loved his sloppy relentless enthusiasm on the court. But what\u0027s won me over lately is his T-shirt collection. Recent slogans have included, \"I\u0027m not gay, but my boyfriend is,\" and \"I don\u0027t mind straight people, as long as they act gay in public.\"",
        "But more than that, I think one can say that, for me, familiarity has bred respect. Most of these Bulls are my age or older. Jordan\u0027s my age, and as my body changes, as joints respond less readily, bruises take longer to heal, and hangovers get harder to cure, I have grown to appreciate MJ\u0027s ability to recreate himself. The mad dash fearless dunking of his youth has been replaced by safer, more adult practices. Watch as Michael becomes a post-up player. Watch his transformation into a master of the three-point heave. See Michael learn and perfect the unstoppable Larry Bird fade away.",
        "Facing the cameras for the gagillionth time, following a perfect evening spent revealing the tragic flaws of yet another squad of opponents who had been, until meeting the Bulls, flirting with respectability, Jordan, Pippen, and their teammates exude a pungent, delicious aura. Invincibility is, inevitably, sexy. These are Bodhisattvas, approaching Buddhahood, utterly at peace with themselves, and yet at the same time, striving mightily for the next level of enlightenment. Gone for me the rebel\u0027s glory. Gone the exalted status of an arch-antagonist. Gone the thrill of withstanding the Bulls fans contumely. Woe, woe is me. Go, go Bulls.",
        "There is no greater pleasure than being a Bulls hater in a Bulls-loving town.",
        "How to describe the sweet, sweet pleasure of entering a drinking establishment full of established drinkers, and proudly letting out a roar whenever the diminutive Detroit guard Isiah Thomas scooped a layup high off the backboard into the basket, or Vinnie \"The Microwave\" Johnson would launch a shot with, oh, three of four opposing players hanging from his thick arms and legs, or Joe Dumars covering the great god Michael Jordan would, through fainting, decoying, and overplaying, manipulate MJ into the waiting arms and oh-so solid body of Bill Laimbeer.",
        "To let out a roar as those around me grumbled, all the time harboring grandiose notions that, in so roaring, I was courting a barroom beating at the hands of, say, those five beefy guys at the bar with a pitcher of Old Style, the identical number 23 red-and-white jerseys, and, shaved into their crew cuts Anthony Mason style, the letters B-U-L-L-S, respectively.",
        "To stand alone against a sea of popular opinion, to be associated with a great malevolent force, shady underground figures, the Detroit Pistons, this was a spectacular seduction. To be a Pistons fan in Chicago, like being a Navy fan at West Point, or a Dodgers fan in Manhattan in the old days, seemed heroic. I was Pancho Villa on a border raid, Bartleby the Scrivener telling his boss, I would prefer not to, Brando in the Wild One rebelling against, what do you got? It was the same contrary impulse, however, the thrill of being the lone fan, that turned my girlfriend against me.",
        "Accepted into an elite east coast graduate school, she suddenly found herself surrounded by elite east coast fans of the New York Knickerbockers. Though up to this point, her interest in the Bulls had consisted wholly in the observation that point guard B.J. Armstrong was so cute, and, in an almost obsessive curiosity, regarding that odd bald patch in the middle of center Bill Cartwright\u0027s beard. Her grad school experience turned her into a raving rooter for the team that I so proudly despised. In a world of Knicks lovers, she chose to be the lone fan of the Bulls.",
        "Watching games with her became an unsettling experience. When our teams would clash, I would catch her eyeing me strangely, as if contemplating which Bill Laimbeer thrown elbow or Rick Mahorn cheap shot I was complicit in, in what ways I, the bully by association, might have wronged those near and dear to her, and subsequently, what punishments or deprivations she might legitimately inflict on me in response."

            "The story goes like this. Recently I heard about this couple. He\u0027s in his 40s. She\u0027s in her mid-20s. And the way it was explained to me, they were having this conversation, and it was one of these conversations that, if you\u0027ve ever been in a couple with a big age difference, maybe you\u0027ve taken part in, he was saying basically, what can you see in me? You know, you are so young and energetic and I\u0027m this older person. I\u0027m so much more serious.",
            "And they talked about this and talked about this. And finally, she brought the conversation to a stop by declaring, no, no, no, don\u0027t you understand? I am Dennis Rodman. You are Phil Jackson. You ground me. I am wild. You make everything all right. And that\u0027s the way it is right now in Chicago, where I speak to you from right now. Our historic championship basketball team, the Chicago Bulls, is not just the winningest team of all time, with 72 regular season wins, now hurtling through the NBA playoffs. What\u0027s happened here in Chicago is that the Bulls are now the lens through which we view all of our experiences. They\u0027re the benchmark against we\u0027re measuring everything in our lives. They\u0027ve become our reality.",

At nights in Chicago, now the Hancock building, which towers over the city, is lit a bright Bulls-red. Bulls posters and souvenirs and caps and T-shirts are for sale in every video storage and corner drugstore, in bars, everywhere. It\u0027s like living in China during the cultural revolution. Slogans and propaganda, everywhere, all uniting us as one people. The name United Center was never more appropriate than now. There we are, united behind the vanguard-- Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil, Luke, our vanguard, and all the others.",

The Bulls are like the soap opera that everyone in the city is watching, with this eccentric cast of characters that we all know. And watching a Bulls game, for most people, is a social event, where everybody swaps stories and theories and predictions.",

Guys were not crazy about all this. But faced with a microphone, nobody wanted to say anything too negative about the star rebounder. And everyone had found a comfortable way to explain his behavior.",

            "People stream in and out of the barber shop. Everyone comments on the game. In the second half, when Michael Jordan takes a nasty spill, a customer shouts, \"Superman\u0027s down!\" The man sitting next to me introduces himself as Mr. Popcorn, a customer of Coleman\u0027s beginning 34 years ago, and a former high school basketball player himself.",
            "So when you see these players, is there some player who you really relate to the way they play?",
            "The effect of the Bulls on the local economy is usually measured in millions of dollars, but it extends to 1,000 small shops like this one. Mr. Popcorn says that if the Bulls take the championship, he\u0027s going to sell Bulls T-shirts himself. And before long, he asked me the question that he asked a lot of customers at Colemans.",

            "You gotta respect somebody who\u0027ll publicly argue against what may be the best basketball team ever to play the game. It takes a certain amount of guts. But soon enough, this Bulls team will have to fade, especially given the age of players, mostly in their 30s. And it can be a sobering thought that, years from now, when all these guys are watching some new incarnation of the Bulls, this is the moment, this is the time right now, that they\u0027re going to remember together.",

His brother, James, whose chair is furthest from the screen, is calling for a four-game sweep, Bulls over Orlando. But sandwiched midway between the two brothers, standing in the middle chair, Tommy was the lone dissenter in a crowded room of probably three dozen Bulls fanatics, some of whom, remember, were armed with razors. It took a certain nerve to placidly insist, hour after hour, that Shaquille O\u0027Neal and the Magic were going to pull this series out of the bag.",

This week, as the Chicago Bull\u0027s careen past the winningest season in basketball history, through the NBA playoffs, our theme is basketball. And let us ask the question again, what is the meaning of sports? The answer, trophies. Well, looked at it in one way, that\u0027s the answer.",

The problem is that trophies do not age well. The further you get from the triumphant moment when you win the trophy, the uglier the trophy becomes. Until, after decades, they just look like dusty, aging clutter, carrying no glory, no numinous power.",

Picture this, a thick slice of wood, sanded and shellacked and mounted with a miniature rim and backboard, and then, leaping across the front, a stick figure made of roofing nails going in for a slam dunk. Mary identified this as her 1978 girls varsity team trophy from Cardinal Dougherty High School. And the girls, she said, had not been pleased with the trophy at all.",

She\u0027d just moved to a new apartment, and her new place was small, so small that a bunch of high school trophies would just dominate any room they were in. She had the trophies in a box in the living room, and we sat on the floor pulling out fake silver statuettes of girls in coolots, reaching ever upward, hopeful and fit, like in Soviet propaganda posters.",

            "Mary handed me the wood-sliced trophy. And when I reached to touch the stick figure, I realized that one of its feet was on a pivot, so I could actually make it go in for the dunk. Once I discovered this, it was impossible not to do it over and over and over. The trophy was completely hypnotizing, a disturbing artifact from an artistic period best forgotten.",

The two of them roamed around the city together looking for pickup games whenever they could, all summer, every weekend, even at night, because the court down the street had lights. It was a way to get out of the house, to escape the chaos of 11 kids in a working class Irish family in a too-small house on the edge of Northeast Philadelphia. Basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense. And home was a place where you could get hit for no reason, or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal. Mary remembered being hungry a lot growing up, a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school.",
            "Another good thing about basketball was that it was cheap. Mary bought the family a rim and a basketball for their backyard when she was only seven or eight, using her first communion money, $65 in $5 increments from everyone in her huge family. The only equipment she really needed and could never afford were good shoes.",
            "She always had those supermarket checkout line shoes with the hard plastic soles that were completely embarrassing, of course, but also had no grippability. So she would be running down a court and go sliding and be called for traveling. So one year, she got up the courage to ask a girl down the block for her old shoes.",
            "We talked for two hours about basketball. And we kept returning to the dunk, that special thing boys can do and girls can\u0027t. And the cruelty of the dunk on that wood-sliced trophy, a dunk by a stick figure made of nails, driving home their 18-year-old sense of frustration. They could be the best ball handlers, the best guards, and it didn\u0027t matter worth a damn because they couldn\u0027t dunk. All of that captured forever in the last trophy most of them would ever receive.",

            "So can\u0027t you see, like, feeling really tough walking home with something this big, especially if you hold it like this?",
            "It\u0027s ugly, isn\u0027t it?",
            "We were all really unhappy. We wanted, like, a traditional--",
            "[LAUGHS] Yes.",
            "We would rather have had, like, the also ugly but much more acceptable old version of trophies than those trophies.",
            "Right, right.",
            "You want something that goes up high in the sky, not something that is a slice of a tree.",
            "A slice of a tree with a nail stick figure soldered together, doing the one thing that you know you\u0027ll never be able to do-- dunk.",
            "Oh, yeah. And we also thought that that was the only reason we\u0027d never been in the NBA. Luckily for us, we all thought, well, you know, we\u0027re really some of the best players on the face of the Earth. You know, when you\u0027re a 16-year-old girl who\u0027s playing at a tough Catholic league school, like you think, yeah, we\u0027re good enough. I\u0027m just as good as Maurice Cheeks. And you know, the Doctor would like to play with me, Doctor J. And we could attribute our lack of success in the NBA to the fact that we were girls, soon to be women, who would never dunk. And that\u0027s all that was keeping us from it.",
            "The art of the late \u002770s, especially in Catholic religion textbooks and churches and stuff was so ugly.",
            "I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve been so influenced by it, it\u0027s like, you know--",
            "--those little ink drawings that are just a little bit off on-purpose. You know what I mean? And the on-purposeness of it is just, like--",
            "--oh, help me. Yeah, right, right. You can always hear a Cat Stevens song playing in the background.",
            "The message was, you couldn\u0027t be hungry because your parents are saints. And they especially directed it to our family and all the other families that had a lot of kids in them, that our parents were saints because they worked so hard to provide for us. So I thought that I was just extraordinarily greedy that I would want to eat when I was hungry. I think that playing basketball was a way to say, you know, if I could use my body in this way, that got me status and attention and a certain amount of prestige, then my body was OK in a way, even though it was-- I mean, I was way too skinny when I was a kid.",
            "And it was cause for concern for the school nurse a couple times. And playing basketball was a way to say, you know, you\u0027re not going to have neural damage from being malnourished. You\u0027re just going to have these other minor malnourished problems.",
            "Her name was Karen, and she had really nice Beta Bullets, high tops, white. And I wanted her sneakers because I knew she was getting new ones. And in our neighborhood, there is the practice of throwing your old sneakers up over the telephone wires when you\u0027re done with them. And most of them were hardly worn out at all. I mean, a lot of them, you could see that there was tread missing, but it\u0027s not like you had ripped through the top of them.",
            "And I\u0027d asked her for them, and she said, yeah, that she would give them to me when she got her new ones. I thought that it was a little bit weird that I would ask somebody for their used shoes, but we had other clothes that were used from other people. And she was tough, and she kind of had this-- she seemed like she\u0027d be the kind of person that could keep something like that to her and would know what it meant. And she did. She never told anybody, except, of course, the most important person that she shouldn\u0027t have told, her mother.",
            "And her mother got really upset and told her that she couldn\u0027t give them to me. And there they were, hanging up on the telephone wire, my sneakers.",
            "And I\u0027m sure that her mom did that because she was afraid that if I came home with a pair of used sneakers that it would be insulting to my mother. I\u0027m sure that they all had this understanding of themselves, like you don\u0027t insult one of your peers by giving their kids your crappy shoes even though they\u0027re better than the crappy shoes that you bought for them.",
            "But there were always really beautiful sneakers hanging up on the wires, and there was no way to get them, no way at all. They just floated up there. And you know what? I think that\u0027s when I decided that platonic idealism was true. There really was a perfect thing that I would never experience, at least while I played in that Catholic league. And only I could see them for what they were. They only saw worn-out tread. I saw a season of unforeseen high statistics.",
            "I think it was really kind of thoughtless in the way that thoughtless things can sometimes have a really nasty edge to them. And we had a woman on our team who was African-American who was, like 6\u00273, and she couldn\u0027t dunk the ball. You know what I mean? It was like there was no one that we knew who could dunk the ball, not a single woman that we knew. And we knew some tall women. We knew women who were in college. I mean, I used to have a dream, a recurring dream that I dunked the ball.",
            "I was on the baseline.",
            "I was in the same position all the time. And it wasn\u0027t like kinds of dunks that you see in real life, like that even the best players can do. This was a spectacular dunk, because I didn\u0027t just get my hands up over the rim, I sailed over the rim with my feet and got above the basket and just slammed the ball down through the thing. My whole body was above the rim.",
            "And stayed inbounds the whole time."

            "This year, as every one in the world now knows, the Bulls won 72 games and lost a mere 10, making them, numerically at least, the most successful team of all time. It is also the year I, without meaning to, traded in the great and noble pleasure of publicly hating the Bulls in every bar, tavern, and speak easy of this beer-swilling town for the rather common, tawdry pleasure of joining the masses in whooping up every Jordan jumper, Pippen put-back, and Kukoc [UNINTELLIGIBLE].",
            "And why? Well, for one thing, three of my old Pistons have joined the current version of the Bulls. John \"Spider\" Salley, who can still block a shot with the best of them. James \"Buddha\" Edwards, who, at the age of 40, still successfully practices his specialty, the fade away chip shot from the paint. And of course, Dennis \"The Worm\" Rodman. I\u0027ve always loved his sloppy relentless enthusiasm on the court. But what\u0027s won me over lately is his T-shirt collection. Recent slogans have included, \"I\u0027m not gay, but my boyfriend is,\" and \"I don\u0027t mind straight people, as long as they act gay in public.\"",
            "But more than that, I think one can say that, for me, familiarity has bred respect. Most of these Bulls are my age or older. Jordan\u0027s my age, and as my body changes, as joints respond less readily, bruises take longer to heal, and hangovers get harder to cure, I have grown to appreciate MJ\u0027s ability to recreate himself. The mad dash fearless dunking of his youth has been replaced by safer, more adult practices. Watch as Michael becomes a post-up player. Watch his transformation into a master of the three-point heave. See Michael learn and perfect the unstoppable Larry Bird fade away.",
            "Facing the cameras for the gagillionth time, following a perfect evening spent revealing the tragic flaws of yet another squad of opponents who had been, until meeting the Bulls, flirting with respectability, Jordan, Pippen, and their teammates exude a pungent, delicious aura. Invincibility is, inevitably, sexy. These are Bodhisattvas, approaching Buddhahood, utterly at peace with themselves, and yet at the same time, striving mightily for the next level of enlightenment. Gone for me the rebel\u0027s glory. Gone the exalted status of an arch-antagonist. Gone the thrill of withstanding the Bulls fans contumely. Woe, woe is me. Go, go Bulls.",
            "There is no greater pleasure than being a Bulls hater in a Bulls-loving town.",
            "How to describe the sweet, sweet pleasure of entering a drinking establishment full of established drinkers, and proudly letting out a roar whenever the diminutive Detroit guard Isiah Thomas scooped a layup high off the backboard into the basket, or Vinnie \"The Microwave\" Johnson would launch a shot with, oh, three of four opposing players hanging from his thick arms and legs, or Joe Dumars covering the great god Michael Jordan would, through fainting, decoying, and overplaying, manipulate MJ into the waiting arms and oh-so solid body of Bill Laimbeer.",
            "To let out a roar as those around me grumbled, all the time harboring grandiose notions that, in so roaring, I was courting a barroom beating at the hands of, say, those five beefy guys at the bar with a pitcher of Old Style, the identical number 23 red-and-white jerseys, and, shaved into their crew cuts Anthony Mason style, the letters B-U-L-L-S, respectively.",
            "To stand alone against a sea of popular opinion, to be associated with a great malevolent force, shady underground figures, the Detroit Pistons, this was a spectacular seduction. To be a Pistons fan in Chicago, like being a Navy fan at West Point, or a Dodgers fan in Manhattan in the old days, seemed heroic. I was Pancho Villa on a border raid, Bartleby the Scrivener telling his boss, I would prefer not to, Brando in the Wild One rebelling against, what do you got? It was the same contrary impulse, however, the thrill of being the lone fan, that turned my girlfriend against me.",
            "Accepted into an elite east coast graduate school, she suddenly found herself surrounded by elite east coast fans of the New York Knickerbockers. Though up to this point, her interest in the Bulls had consisted wholly in the observation that point guard B.J. Armstrong was so cute, and, in an almost obsessive curiosity, regarding that odd bald patch in the middle of center Bill Cartwright\u0027s beard. Her grad school experience turned her into a raving rooter for the team that I so proudly despised. In a world of Knicks lovers, she chose to be the lone fan of the Bulls.",
            "Watching games with her became an unsettling experience. When our teams would clash, I would catch her eyeing me strangely, as if contemplating which Bill Laimbeer thrown elbow or Rick Mahorn cheap shot I was complicit in, in what ways I, the bully by association, might have wronged those near and dear to her, and subsequently, what punishments or deprivations she might legitimately inflict on me in response."

In contrast, the Scottie Pippen Dodge store on Western Avenue in Chicago is, I will argue, the most modest product endorsement in the NBA. It\u0027s a car dealership selling Intrepids and Neons and Dodge 4x4s. And right now, during the playoffs, the showrooms are filled with balloons and basketball players made out of balloons. The windows are painted with the words \"Playoff Payoff.\" But mostly, it looks like any other Dodge dealership, a little rundown, with posters of Scottie and Bulls insignias here and there.",

And there is, after all, something a little strange about buying a car from a dealership whose spokesman can sometimes be a bully on the basketball court.

On the wall are a few not-terribly significant mementos, a picture with the \u002793 Olympic Dream Team, a license plate with Scottie\u0027s number, 33, on it. There\u0027s a mini refrigerator, though Beau and I didn\u0027t have the nerve to look inside. Beau did take a peek at the private bathroom and saw Scottie\u0027s toilet. The most personal positions in the office are a picture of Scottie\u0027s dogs, and some amusements.",
            "What\u0027s the parrot?",
            "I figured I should have a real Bulls fan with me when I visited, so I brought Beau O\u0027Reilly, a Chicago playwright and musician and actor who\u0027s been on our program here a few times, and a Scottie Pippen fan. He pressed the owner of the dealership, Nick Farschi, for details about Pippen. But really, what\u0027s the guy going to say?",
            "Mr. Farschi guesses that if Scottie does well and the Bulls win the NBA Finals, it could mean as many as 15 or 20 extra Dodge vans, trucks, and cars sold from this store. If the Scottie Pippen Dodge store is the most understated Bulls-related business, in this, our fair city, with no TV ads, barely any Bulls hype, the most garish manifestation of the merchandising of basketball is downtown on Michigan Avenue, a combination shoe store and museum called Niketown.",
            "Niketown is the size of a small department store, reportedly grosses $2.5 million in sales each week. Inside, there are statues of athletes in midair, a 20-foot banner of Michael Jordan with a quote from William Blake underneath, display cases with sports memorabilia, slogans everywhere, like \"Play to Win,\" \"Total Body Conditioning,\" \"Test Your Faith,\" on long banners hung in a mock socialist, WPA style. When you go inside Niketown, there are 18 separate pavilions, each with its own kind of sight and sound environment, like a real basketball court floor, and the sounds of squeaking sneakers on hardwood in the area that sells basketball stuff, the sound of tennis balls being hit in another area where they sell tennis stuff.",
            "As the writer, Andrew Levy, points out-- it\u0027s from a piece he wrote-- \"The buying of goods invokes a sequence of events and images that make the purchase itself playful. Items move from the fourth-floor storeroom to the cashier stations through clear plastic tubes rimmed with green neon that suggest, as they are meant to, the cartoon future of the Jetsons. The direct purchase of goods is designed to appear to be an afterthought. The retail areas are cramped compared to the open atriums designed for the display of art and statuary. And the store\u0027s design requires every entering customer to be distracted by considerable aesthetics before reaching any locale where Nike items can actually be purchased. There are whimsical, anarchic features everywhere in Niketown. Tropical fish swim in a 22-foot, 1,000-gallon tank behind the hiking shoe display. A bank of nine television screens embedded beneath the floor nearby flashes images of glimmering swimming pools and waterfalls. It is seductive and very effective at creating sales.\"",
            "The song styling of Jewboy Cain, aka Mr. Jeff Dorchen.",
            "Note that only the last of these, the conversion van, can actually be purchased at the Scottie Pippen Dodge store. When offered a chance to lie and push some Dodge product, owner Nick Farschi actually seemed to answer our questions honestly, to his credit. He admitted that Scottie only drops in once every couple months, that Scottie is paid a fee for the use of his name, and the business has increased a total of 10% or 15% since they put Scottie\u0027s name above the door. People do come in hoping to meet Scottie, or simply to get near the Scottie Pippen magic.",
            "And Nick Farschi said that, during 1994, when Scottie had a bad year on the court, walked out of a game with 1.8 seconds left, was arrested for carrying an illegal gun, was accused of domestic violence, well, sales did suffer."

It\u0027s a car dealership selling Intrepids and Neons and Dodge 4x4s. And right now, during the playoffs, the showrooms are filled with balloons and basketball players made out of balloons.

When you go inside Niketown, there are 18 separate pavilions, each with its own kind of sight and sound environment, like a real basketball court floor, and the sounds of squeaking sneakers on hardwood in the area that sells basketball stuff, the sound of tennis balls being hit in another area where they sell tennis stuff."

The direct purchase of goods is designed to appear to be an afterthought. The retail areas are cramped compared to the open atriums designed for the display of art and statuary. And the store\u0027s design requires every entering customer to be distracted by considerable aesthetics before reaching any locale where Nike items can actually be purchased. There are whimsical, anarchic features everywhere in Niketown. Tropical fish swim in a 22-foot, 1,000-gallon tank behind the hiking shoe display. A bank of nine television screens embedded beneath the floor nearby flashes images of glimmering swimming pools and waterfalls. It is seductive and very effective at creating sales.\""

            "And for this one second, I could feel it. It was the first time in my life that I ever-- and I woke up from the dream-- I ever realized that that\u0027s a possibility, that pain is something that you don\u0027t necessarily need to feel all the time to understand it.",
            "Because there\u0027s thing, there\u0027s Michael Jordan, and you see it in his eyes. And it happened during the Miami series of this year. I don\u0027t know how it is, but his eyes turn inward. He becomes very serious and solemn. And you feel that he is taking everyone on the team and just taking all their faults, all their backaches, all their problems, all their ego trips, and he\u0027s cushioning them for them. He\u0027s saying, \"Look, I\u0027m Michael Jordan, I\u0027m going to win the game, you know that, stop. Just let it all loose and we\u0027re going to win the game.\""
