The story starts when I was in my car. And I just realized that I have my preset station buttons arranged in order of preference. One, two, three, four, five, six. And so I sort of go down. And this station number six was the classic rock station, Rock 103. And number six is often just awful. Every once in a while, they\u0027ll have a good Led Zeppelin song on, and that\u0027s why I have it set.","So I hit it, and there\u0027s that song, which I don\u0027t know the name of, but it\u0027s that one that goes, \"ooh, child, things are going to get easier.\" And I think to myself, that\u0027s certainly an expansive definition of classic rock. So then I think, wow, this is great. And then another song comes on. And it\u0027s \"Disco Inferno,\" or something like that.","And I think now, something must be wrong. So I look and I think, the first thing is that somebody\u0027s been messing with my dials. Like somebody got into my car and rearranged my radio stations. But then I look at the numbers. The numbers are the same.","And then I hear this announcement that comes on. And it\u0027s like, \"You\u0027ve found the new 1035, Jammin\u0027 Oldies.\" And I think to myself, what the hell is a jammin\u0027 oldie? And you have to keep in mind that the day before, this station had been playing Anthrax and Slayer, and every once in a while, like I said, a Led Zeppelin song, but basically heavy metal gearhead music. And now all of a sudden, there\u0027s just no mention being made of it. And it\u0027s just like the old station was disappeared.","Now what has happened is that this station had a format change over the weekend, basically. And they didn\u0027t mention it on the weekend, when I had been listening before. There was no mention of it. They were doing their concert promotions and having people call up to get Anthrax tickets or whatever. Nothing had been said.","And so obviously, everybody who has been tuning in before is expecting the classic rock. But they don\u0027t want to seem like they\u0027re a new station. They don\u0027t want to seem like the new kid on the block.","So what they do, is they do what everybody does on the first day. They pretend like it\u0027s not the first day. They want to establish this illusion that they\u0027ve been around forever, so they have these little promo spots that come on, these little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] where they have people they\u0027ve interviewed-- like, man on the street interviews-- where people are talking about how great jammin\u0027 oldies are, and how wonderful it is to have this station that plays jammin\u0027 oldies which has been on the radio for three hours.","You know? Like, what did they do? They just start broadcasting, and immediately send a squad of people out to find people who are accidentally tuned in? No.","And that also comes through. I mean, if you hear the spots, it\u0027s like this sort of desperately-- It\u0027s like they\u0027re trying too hard. And it\u0027s just exactly what happens when you\u0027re trying to fit in too hard, and you\u0027re pretending like you\u0027ve around forever, and you know the ropes, and it just falls flat.

Saturday night in this village. Really quiet. Super cold. And this call came over for unknown animal in a house. And it was on my post. It was about five minutes away.","So myself and another car were assigned the call. And we show up there. And luckily for me, it was another guy who was pretty new. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on. The nylon coat, the vest, the belt, the whole nine yards.","And the door opens, and the guy who is behind the door, he\u0027s about 30. I was 23 at the time. He\u0027s about 30. He looks like a broker, a lawyer. Just really well put together. A nice guy wearing glasses. He\u0027s wearing these silk pajamas with a monogram. Got my attention. And he\u0027s going, listen, I\u0027m really sorry to bother you. Normally I\u0027d handle this sort of stuff on my own. But my wife really insisted I call.","And so we ask him what the problem is. He says, well, we were having kind of a romantic evening down in the living room, and we heard this scratching upstairs. So I ran upstairs to see what it was. And it turns out it\u0027s coming from the attic. There\u0027s something up there, and it\u0027s just running around, knocking a few small things over. I can\u0027t tell what it is. It could be a squirrel or raccoon. I really don\u0027t know.","So the other cop that I was with said, well, you know, we really don\u0027t handle that. It\u0027s not so much a police function. But we do have numbers of these private contractors who will come in and they\u0027ll put a humane trap down, and they\u0027ll remove the animal for you. It\u0027s really not such a big deal. But it\u0027s really not our thing.","So right as he was in the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook, the guy swings the door back, and there is his wife, who was just beautiful. She was beautiful. She was probably about 26 or 27, but just really beautiful. Perfect skin, long blond hair, great teeth, brilliant blue eyes, a really nice smile. Just, like, beautiful and friendly. You know? If she had said, eat this broken glass, I just would have said, OK, broken glass it is. It\u0027s fine.","But she seemed really nice. So I was going to be, like, Galahad. So I just threw my arm back into this guy\u0027s chest, into my partner\u0027s chest. And I said, Mark, we can handle this. It\u0027ll be OK.","And she was just, oh, thank you so much. And she was really sweet. And I was, like, struck dead. So we walk inside. And she goes, I\u0027m going to throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs. We follow the man of the house upstairs. And we\u0027re underneath one of those trapdoors that goes into the attic with the staircase that folds out.","And we do hear an animal upstairs scratching away, just kind of scuttling around the floor. And there\u0027s definitely something up there. And it\u0027s making pretty good speed going from one end of the roof to the other. So I reached up, and I took the trapdoor down. We unfolded the ladder.","Now I have this big, heavy flashlight, your cop flashlight. The 4 D-cells, the metal case, the whole thing. I shine it up through the hole in there. And it\u0027s pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the latter. Now, the guy who owned the house is standing almost directly underneath me, just to the side of the latter, looking straight up at me. And my partner\u0027s at the base of the latter, right behind me.","So just before I stuck my head through this black hole, I just kind of pause. I crunch my body up underneath, because I\u0027m realizing, gee, I don\u0027t know where this thing is. The second we pulled down the trap door, all noise upstairs just ceased. So I was kind of nervous. And I was like, well, you know, I look like an idiot, just crouched up here on the top of the ladder. So I took the flashlight, and I just popped my head up, turned the light on again.","And about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel, at eye level with me, kind of reared back on its legs. And I swear, from where I was standing, it looked like Godzilla. It just scared the heck out of me. I thought, it\u0027s a squirrel. It\u0027s going to be hiding somewhere. It\u0027s going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me. And it really startled me. So I kind of went, \"ah!\" And jumped back.","And the flashlight slips out of my hands-- and it\u0027s heavy-- and it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who\u0027s looking straight up at me. And I don\u0027t think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose-- his hands up to his face, blood just started pouring out between his hands.","This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards, directly onto my partner, and I just pancake him. We\u0027re both our backs. He\u0027s on his back. I\u0027m on his stomach, on my back, scuttling around like a beetle, trying to get up in this really narrow hallway. It\u0027s a mess.","The squirrel, while we\u0027re floundering around in the hallway, jumps down the stairs-- boink, boink, boink-- lands on me, and takes off down the stairs.","It was terrible. It was terrible. So we\u0027re wondering, gee, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, you hear her scream. So my partner goes, well, we found the squirrel. It\u0027s wherever she is.","So we go running downstairs. And the squirrel had come into the living room, where they had been having their romantic evening. They had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around one corner of the couch next to the fire, and they had champagne flutes out. Nice house. Really nice. I mean, it just smelled brand new. New carpeting, new rugs, new paint. They hadn\u0027t been there for that long.","So the squirrel, when it bolted down the staircase, took off into the living room and ran underneath the couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is bleeding all over the place, on his carpets. His wife looks and says, what have you done to my husband? I start going, oh, it was an accident-- and then I just stop in mid-sentence. What\u0027s the point? We\u0027ve only been there about two minutes.","So the squirrel is underneath the couch. And my partner is going, let\u0027s get out of here. This is just-- it\u0027s not going well. So I am not beaten yet. I always have another idea.","So the squirrel is under this couch, which in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don\u0027t we move the furniture away from one of the corners? And we\u0027ll put the catch in the corner. And the squirrel will probably move along with the couch, because it\u0027s the only cover available to it. And once we get into the corner, we\u0027ll only have two open sides of the couch to worry about. So we did that.","Yes. Yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instant. But you know.","I asked her for a box. And she says, sure, we\u0027ve got boxes. We just moved in. We have nothing but boxes. She runs out to the garage. And she comes back with a box. And the box is long enough. And it fits across the entire short side of the couch, where the armrests would be. So I start sweeping underneath the couch with my nightstick, trying to move the squirrel toward the box. Figuring we\u0027ll capture it and just get rid of it. And we\u0027ll be out of here. And there\u0027ll be no more mayhem.","So it\u0027s actually working very well. And the squirrel\u0027s moving down along. You can hear it. It\u0027s chittering. And I\u0027m trying not to hurt it. I\u0027m nervous about the thing. It might bite me. I don\u0027t want to hurt it, really. It\u0027s just an animal.","So I\u0027m moving it along. And everything\u0027s going very well. And then with about eight inches to go, I took one more swipe, and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch. It was lined with tassels. I couldn\u0027t really see under the couch. It bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. The fireplace was directly head of it, and it ran into the fire, and caught on fire, and ran directly back out, and directly back under the couch.","It was on fire. Yeah. The tail, the bushy fur, the whole bit. I mean, it wasn\u0027t, like, flaming or anything. But it was smoking. And there was a little bit of fire coming off the tail. So it runs back under the couch. And the couch catches on fire in seconds. I mean, in seconds. It must have had dust under there or something else. But it just caught on fire immediately.","And my partner and I just don\u0027t even talk. We just grab the couch, heave it upside down. And now there\u0027s plenty of oxygen for the fire to really get going. And it starts up. And we\u0027re patting it out. And it\u0027s sort of getting away from us. So we grab the only thing that\u0027s really available. And those are these really nice silk pillows. And we have one in each hand, the both of us. And we\u0027re just windmilling away at this fire on the couch. And we put it out.","But it\u0027s smoking terribly. And it was just a disaster. The couch is upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filling with smoke from the couch. The squirrel, when it went under the couch, in its death throes, just latched on to the bottom of the couch. It\u0027s like this smoking piece of gristle underneath the couch, latched on there with its claws. And we\u0027re pounding, smearing it all over the place. And the smoke alarms are firing away. The guy is standing with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose, which is still bleeding. His pajamas are a mess. They\u0027re covered with blood, the front of them.","And we finally get the fire out. And we\u0027re both completely red. Sweating, because we\u0027re dressed for like zero degree weather, and it\u0027s hot there, by the fire. We\u0027re mortified. The house is full of smoke.","The wife just looks around and just starts to cry. She goes, what have you done? What have you done to my house? You can see her just clicking things off on the fingers. OK. The dead squirrel, ruined pillows, need a new couch, the walls are covered with soot, the fire alarms are going off, my husband\u0027s disfigured. And then she really kind of just lost it.","And he was just looking at us and shaking his head, like he couldn\u0027t believe that these two idiots showed up and did this to his house over nothing, really. And he just goes, you know, you really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I can\u0027t point to any one thing that you did that I have a reason to get angry about. You really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I mean, we did call you. But I just, I can\u0027t thank you for this. They call for a squirrel. They end up with $3,000, $4,000 worth of damage and a broken nose. And this is all within about five minutes.","There\u0027s always a new mistake to be made. I don\u0027t think I would make that particular mistake. I mean, you make plenty of mistakes. That\u0027s just part of that job. You just try not to make the same one twice. But there\u0027s such variety that you\u0027re going to make hundreds, you\u0027re going to make thousands of mistakes, until you really get a handle on what you\u0027re doing.","Right. And with police work, they afford you plenty of space to make mistakes. But there are things that just aren\u0027t your responsibility-- if you get involved in things that aren\u0027t your responsibility, or that you\u0027re really not equipped to handle, or that you don\u0027t have a specific plan-- a plan that\u0027s thought through to a conclusion-- you probably should reevaluate what you\u0027re doing.","That\u0027s a great question. I guess I was thinking that I would go up there in the attic, and find this cowering squirrel, and somehow kind of lure it into some kind of trap, and then walk out with it and be like a hero. But as it turned out, it was a Pyrrhic victory for the squirrel, but the squirrel definitely won. The squirrel really kicked our ass.","No, no. It took me a long time to even tell people about it, you know? I was so new. I didn\u0027t want to know what a bonehead I was when I first came onto the job.","What I thought it would be was one adventure after another, kind of. And that sounds childish. But that\u0027s sort of what I did envision. And then one of the very first days I was on, I had the school crossing where I used to go to school. So at 23, I was crossing these kids where I had went to grammar school and I went to high school. Freezing cold. And I knew just about every third or fourth car that went by. And everyone\u0027s beeping and honking. And there was some slush on the ground.","And my mother drove by. And she stopped in the middle of the intersection. And she goes, what are you doing out here without a hat on?","Not at all. Not at all.","You know, she just, what are you doing out here without a hat on? Mom, I have the hat I\u0027m supposed to wear. She\u0027s like, but it doesn\u0027t cover your ears. It\u0027s freezing out here.","And that\u0027s when I started to realize, hey, this isn\u0027t all about car chases and everything else. It\u0027s just like living at home."],"spokenWords":["But she seemed really nice. So I was going to be, like, Galahad.

Sweating, because we\u0027re dressed for like zero degree weather, and it\u0027s hot there, by the fire. We\u0027re mortified. The house is full of smoke.","It was on fire. Yeah. The tail, the bushy fur, the whole bit. I mean, it wasn\u0027t, like, flaming or anything. But it was smoking. And there was a little bit of fire coming off the tail. So it runs back under the couch. And the couch catches on fire in seconds. I mean, in seconds. It must have had dust under there or something else. But it just caught on fire immediately.","And the door opens, and the guy who is behind the door, he\u0027s about 30. I was 23 at the time. He\u0027s about 30. He looks like a broker, a lawyer. Just really well put together. A nice guy wearing glasses. He\u0027s wearing these silk pajamas with a monogram. Got my attention. And he\u0027s going, listen, I\u0027m really sorry to bother you. Normally I\u0027d handle this sort of stuff on my own. But my wife really insisted I call.","So it\u0027s actually working very well. And the squirrel\u0027s moving down along. You can hear it. It\u0027s chittering. And I\u0027m trying not to hurt it. I\u0027m nervous about the thing. It might bite me. I don\u0027t want to hurt it, really. It\u0027s just an animal.","There\u0027s always a new mistake to be made. I don\u0027t think I would make that particular mistake. I mean, you make plenty of mistakes. That\u0027s just part of that job. You just try not to make the same one twice. But there\u0027s such variety that you\u0027re going to make hundreds, you\u0027re going to make thousands of mistakes, until you really get a handle on what you\u0027re doing.","So the squirrel, when it bolted down the staircase, took off into the living room and ran underneath the couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is bleeding all over the place, on his carpets. His wife looks and says, what have you done to my husband? I start going, oh, it was an accident-- and then I just stop in mid-sentence. What\u0027s the point? We\u0027ve only been there about two minutes.","So myself and another car were assigned the call. And we show up there. And luckily for me, it was another guy who was pretty new. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on. The nylon coat, the vest, the belt, the whole nine yards.","There was nothing, nothing going on. Saturday night in this village. Really quiet. Super cold. And this call came over for unknown animal in a house. And it was on my post. It was about five minutes away.","And my mother drove by. And she stopped in the middle of the intersection. And she goes, what are you doing out here without a hat on?","So the other cop that I was with said, well, you know, we really don\u0027t handle that. It\u0027s not so much a police function. But we do have numbers of these private contractors who will come in and they\u0027ll put a humane trap down, and they\u0027ll remove the animal for you. It\u0027s really not such a big deal. But it\u0027s really not our thing.","And we do hear an animal upstairs scratching away, just kind of scuttling around the floor. And there\u0027s definitely something up there. And it\u0027s making pretty good speed going from one end of the roof to the other. So I reached up, and I took the trapdoor down. We unfolded the ladder.","So I\u0027m moving it along. And everything\u0027s going very well. And then with about eight inches to go, I took one more swipe, and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch. It was lined with tassels. I couldn\u0027t really see under the couch. It bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. The fireplace was directly head of it, and it ran into the fire, and caught on fire, and ran directly back out, and directly back under the couch.","So the squirrel is underneath the couch. And my partner is going, let\u0027s get out of here. This is just-- it\u0027s not going well. So I am not beaten yet. I always have another idea.","And the flashlight slips out of my hands-- and it\u0027s heavy-- and it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who\u0027s looking straight up at me. And I don\u0027t think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose-- his hands up to his face, blood just started pouring out between his hands.","So we go running downstairs. And the squirrel had come into the living room, where they had been having their romantic evening. They had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around one corner of the couch next to the fire, and they had champagne flutes out. Nice house. Really nice. I mean, it just smelled brand new. New carpeting, new rugs, new paint. They hadn\u0027t been there for that long.","No, no. It took me a long time to even tell people about it, you know? I was so new. I didn\u0027t want to know what a bonehead I was when I first came onto the job.","Yes. Yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instant. But you know.","What I thought it would be was one adventure after another, kind of. And that sounds childish. But that\u0027s sort of what I did envision. And then one of the very first days I was on, I had the school crossing where I used to go to school. So at 23, I was crossing these kids where I had went to grammar school and I went to high school. Freezing cold. And I knew just about every third or fourth car that went by. And everyone\u0027s beeping and honking. And there was some slush on the ground.","The squirrel, while we\u0027re floundering around in the hallway, jumps down the stairs-- boink, boink, boink-- lands on me, and takes off down the stairs.","That\u0027s a great question. I guess I was thinking that I would go up there in the attic, and find this cowering squirrel, and somehow kind of lure it into some kind of trap, and then walk out with it and be like a hero. But as it turned out, it was a Pyrrhic victory for the squirrel, but the squirrel definitely won. The squirrel really kicked our ass.","And she was just, oh, thank you so much. And she was really sweet. And I was, like, struck dead. So we walk inside. And she goes, I\u0027m going to throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs. We follow the man of the house upstairs. And we\u0027re underneath one of those trapdoors that goes into the attic with the staircase that folds out.","Right. And with police work, they afford you plenty of space to make mistakes. But there are things that just aren\u0027t your responsibility-- if you get involved in things that aren\u0027t your responsibility, or that you\u0027re really not equipped to handle, or that you don\u0027t have a specific plan-- a plan that\u0027s thought through to a conclusion-- you probably should reevaluate what you\u0027re doing.","Now I have this big, heavy flashlight, your cop flashlight. The 4 D-cells, the metal case, the whole thing. I shine it up through the hole in there. And it\u0027s pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the latter. Now, the guy who owned the house is standing almost directly underneath me, just to the side of the latter, looking straight up at me. And my partner\u0027s at the base of the latter, right behind me.","You know, she just, what are you doing out here without a hat on? Mom, I have the hat I\u0027m supposed to wear. She\u0027s like, but it doesn\u0027t cover your ears. It\u0027s freezing out here.","And about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel, at eye level with me, kind of reared back on its legs. And I swear, from where I was standing, it looked like Godzilla. It just scared the heck out of me. I thought, it\u0027s a squirrel. It\u0027s going to be hiding somewhere. It\u0027s going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me. And it really startled me. So I kind of went, \"ah!\" And jumped back.","And my partner and I just don\u0027t even talk. We just grab the couch, heave it upside down. And now there\u0027s plenty of oxygen for the fire to really get going. And it starts up. And we\u0027re patting it out. And it\u0027s sort of getting away from us. So we grab the only thing that\u0027s really available. And those are these really nice silk pillows. And we have one in each hand, the both of us. And we\u0027re just windmilling away at this fire on the couch. And we put it out.","So the squirrel is under this couch, which in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don\u0027t we move the furniture away from one of the corners? And we\u0027ll put the catch in the corner. And the squirrel will probably move along with the couch, because it\u0027s the only cover available to it. And once we get into the corner, we\u0027ll only have two open sides of the couch to worry about. So we did that.","This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards, directly onto my partner, and I just pancake him. We\u0027re both our backs. He\u0027s on his back. I\u0027m on his stomach, on my back, scuttling around like a beetle, trying to get up in this really narrow hallway. It\u0027s a mess.","It was terrible. It was terrible. So we\u0027re wondering, gee, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, you hear her scream. So my partner goes, well, we found the squirrel. It\u0027s wherever she is.","But it\u0027s smoking terribly. And it was just a disaster. The couch is upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filling with smoke from the couch. The squirrel, when it went under the couch, in its death throes, just latched on to the bottom of the couch. It\u0027s like this smoking piece of gristle underneath the couch, latched on there with its claws. And we\u0027re pounding, smearing it all over the place. And the smoke alarms are firing away. The guy is standing with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose, which is still bleeding. His pajamas are a mess. They\u0027re covered with blood, the front of them."]},"Dishwasher Pete":{"name":"Dishwasher Pete","episodes":{"115":"First Day"},"statements":["Basically, the rule is this. Never work at a job where I can\u0027t quit and leave the moment the notion struck me. For 10 years, ever since I had established the fundamental rule, I had never broken it.","[UNINTELLIGIBLE] the company that supplied galley hands for oil rigs in a small town outside New Orleans. I filled out a bunch of paperwork and sat around with a half dozen other applicants. When my name was finally called, I walked down a hall to where a guy greeted me.","Too stunned to catch his name, I could only stare at him and think, \"My god, it\u0027s Bill Clinton.\" He was an absolute dead ringer for Bill Clinton. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off him as he led me into his office. The resemblance was remarkable. He had the same puffy cheeks, the same dimpled chin, and the same salt and pepper hair and haircut. He even had that familiar Clinton smirk, only this guy\u0027s smirk seemed to say, I know you think I look like Clinton, and you\u0027re dying to ask me about it.","The Clinton clone said, I had left a couple things blank on my application, such as the make and license plate number of my car. \"I don\u0027t have a car,\" I said.","\"You don\u0027t? Why not?\"","\"Um, I guess I just don\u0027t need one.\"","\"Well, you need one for this job. In fact, owning a car is the most important qualification for being a galley hand.\"","\"I have to own a car to wash dishes on an oil rig?\"","\"That\u0027s right. When you\u0027re on call, and the dispatcher calls and tells you to be down at the coast in three hours, you have to be there. We can\u0027t wait for you to find a car to borrow or to find someone to drive you.\"","\"Oh, well, in that case, I do own a car.\"","\"Great. What kind?\"","\"It\u0027s a station wagon.\"","\"And what\u0027s the license plate number?\"","\"I\u0027m not sure.\"","\"You don\u0027t know your own license plate number?\"","\"Well, I\u0027d have to go outside and check on it.\"","\"You go do that, then.\"","I stepped outside and wrote down the license plate number of a car that I hoped wasn\u0027t his, and then went back in and gave it to him. Minutes later, I was issued a hard hat, safety glasses, and two work shirts. I was now officially on call.","I spent the rest of the afternoon walking back to the city, grasping at my last fleeting moments of freedom. I was on the verge of breaking the fundamental rule, and could foresee only disaster. To make my fretting worse, the next day a friend of a friend, who claimed to be familiar with life on the oil rigs, told me I could expect to be hazed. As if overcoming my occupational claustrophobia wasn\u0027t enough, I was going to have to put up with idiots hazing me, as well.","Two days later, I was flown to an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The helicopter approached the center of three connected platforms and landed on the roof of its uppermost structure. I asked the pilot, \"Where would I find the galley?\" \"Go down those stairs, and someone will show you,\" he said. I took off my headset, put on my hardhat and safety glasses, grabbed my bag, and hopped out. I held the door open, reluctant to break my link to the outside world. \"So where did you say the galley was?\" I shouted over the roar of the whirling blades. \"Just go down those stairs,\" the pilot shouted back. \"Shut the door.\"","I shut the door and ran across the roof. As I dashed down the stairs, the helicopter revved up. I paused momentarily, but resisted the temptation to run back up to the roof. The fundamental rule had been broken. There was nothing left to do but face the consequences.","Down the stairs, I popped my head through an open door and asked a guy which way to the galley. \"Go this way and that,\" he said. \"Down these stairs and those. Can\u0027t miss it.\" I followed his directions and found myself out in the middle of the platform, surrounded by cargo containers and pipes and assorted industrial junk.","\"You passed it. The door is back that way.\" A guy in a tiny window of one of the cargo containers pointed back the way I came. I looked, but didn\u0027t find any doors. Apparently, a little fun was already being had at the new guy\u0027s expense. Were they going to lead me all over the damn rig searching for the galley? I cursed myself for letting the helicopter leave without me.","Then I noticed a piece of cardboard that had scrawled handwriting written on it. It read, \"Keep out. This means you. Wet floor. Signed, Redneck.\" The sign hung from what I realized was a door handle. I tugged and pulled and turned the handle every which way, but couldn\u0027t get the damn door to budge. I was so green, I couldn\u0027t even unlock a simple latch.","I was helpless until, almost magically, the door opened from the inside. In front of me stood the guy I had seen through the window. \"[BLEEP], son,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t just stand there playing with yourself. Come on in.\" He introduced himself as Redneck, the galley steward. My boss.","I stepped inside and asked him where the galley was. \"Man, you\u0027re in the mother[BLEEP] galley,\" he scoffed. Looking around, I was pretty sure he had to be putting me on. Even though I could see a small kitchen, the whole space was barely bigger than the kitchen and dining room of a house.","\"Where does everybody eat, then?\" I asked.","\"Right [BLEEP] there,\" Redneck said, kicking one of the two benches that faced the counter along one wall. Obviously, 100 employees couldn\u0027t fit on those two benches, but since he seemed to think I was gullible, I played along. \"Yeah, OK,\" I said.","The rig clerk, acting as the official welcoming committee, arrived right behind me. He instructed me what to do in case of an emergency. \"If there\u0027s an explosion,\" he said, \"run to whatever platform isn\u0027t burning.\"","Redneck, as I would later learn he insisted on being called, introduced me to Cuz, the other galley hand, who was mopping the kitchen. My job instructions from Redneck were simple. \"As long as you keep them [BLEEP] dishes clean, there ain\u0027t a mother[BLEEP] on this rig who\u0027d give you [BLEEP].\"","After a brief tour of the small kitchen, Redneck showed me to my station. I stepped up to the sinks and assumed by preferred dishwashing stance. Looking straight ahead, I saw heaven. Right there above the sinks, perfectly at eye level, was a porthole. I immediately knew that this little window to the world would play a huge role in helping me survive for two weeks without quitting. I looked out at the endless expanse of the Gulf of Mexico. There wasn\u0027t much to look at-- a whole lot of sea, a whole lot of sky, and dozens of rigs off in the distance-- but already, I felt at ease.","My gaze was broken by Redneck repeatedly saying, \"Hey, pardner. Hey, pardner!\" I didn\u0027t initially recognize my new nickname. \"Hey, pardner,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t [BLEEP] cuss much, do you?\" \"No,\" I answered. \"Not really.\" \"Well [BLEEP],\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to mother[BLEEP] cuss for the both of us, then.\" And he did. Then it was time for lunch.","Redneck explained that, despite the fact that the rig was comprised of three connected platforms, the crew was actually pretty small. Altogether, there were about 30 people to be fed. Their mealtimes were staggered. So there were never more than five or six guys in the galley at any given time. This slow but steady pace applied to the dishes as well. There were always dishes for me to wash, but never any rush to get them done.","Several times during lunch, crew hands walked up to me in the kitchen with big grins on their faces and asked, \"How\u0027s it going, bro?\" \"OK,\" I\u0027d shrug. They waited. For what, I had no idea. They waited, and then they grew irritated with me and stomped out of the kitchen. One guy said, \"What\u0027s this quiet-ass mother[BLEEP]\u0027s problem, Redneck?\" \"He likes looking out that [BLEEP] window. What can I say?\" I didn\u0027t understand. I washed the dishes, I looked out the window, I minded my own business, just as Redneck had instructed. Why would anyone have a problem with that?","After a few more of these encounters over the next couple of days, I finally realized what was going on. The rig hands, after working a gritty shift of roustabouting and roughnecking, expected to be greeted in the galley with some witty remark or joke, maybe even a song or dance. They expected the galley hand to provide some comic relief, like a court jester. What they got instead was me washing dishes and staring out at the sea.","Well, too bad. I wasn\u0027t there to entertain anyone. If I wanted a job shucking and jiving for diners, I would have become a waiter.","Redneck was never at ease. He raced back and forth across the tiny kitchen when he cooked, a constant stream of chatter flowing from his lips. He was a fun and funny guy, but he had a nervous edge that was attributed by all, including himself, to the seven years he spent as a CIA mercenary in southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. I never saw Redneck sit down for more than 30 seconds before he jumped up again and resumed his frantic pacing.","He grew especially nervous when he and I were alone in the galley, and I stood staring out my porthole. \"Goddamn, pardner! Say [BLEEP] something!\" If I had nothing to say, usually I just cursed, since he got a kick out of that. \"[BLEEP] it,\" I\u0027d say. \"You got that right, pardner,\" he\u0027d laugh. \"[BLEEP] it.\" Then, after further contemplation, he\u0027d add, \"Mother[BLEEP] it.\"","Not an hour passed without Redneck raising one of his favorite topics for discussion, sex with farm animals. Redneck was raised on a farm in Arkansas, and was quite knowledgeable about having sex with farm animals, and wasn\u0027t stingy with this information. He was also always prepared to discuss his other favorite topic whenever Cuz was around, the various ways to kill a man. Between Redneck\u0027s experiences in southeast Asia and Cuz\u0027s experiences in street gangs and prison, they had plenty of stories to share and information to exchange. Sometimes when I broke from my daydreaming at the window, I found it difficult to decipher exactly which topic Redneck was presently discussing. \"You just sneak up behind them and get your arms around his [BLEEP] neck like that, and that [BLEEP] is all yours.\"","Every day, the Gulf went through a metamorphosis. For hours on end, I watched the endless expanse of water slosh up and down, back and forth, as the parade of fish, porpoises, seaweed, stingrays, driftwood, and jellyfish swam and floated past. Seabirds soared by on a fixed course to some unseen destination beyond the horizon.","I eyed the dozens of other oil rigs that stood 5, 10, 20 miles across the watery plain. Some appeared no bigger than a blip on the horizon. I wondered a lot about the galley hands on those rigs who were staring back at the blip that was our rig.","The more I stared out at the Gulf, the more transfixed I became by the water. There was water as far as I could see, in all directions. I was surrounded by it. I was trapped by it. My hands soaked in it. I drank it constantly. The more I stared at the water, the less I understood it.","The hazing I had feared as a greenhorn never materialized.

Just had to wake up and jump on the helicopter.","I thought back to the day I landed on the rig.

As I dashed down the stairs, the helicopter revved up. I paused momentarily, but resisted the temptation to run back up to the roof. The fundamental rule had been broken. There was nothing left to do but face the consequences.","\"You passed it. The door is back that way.\" A guy in a tiny window of one of the cargo containers pointed back the way I came. I looked, but didn\u0027t find any doors. Apparently, a little fun was already being had at the new guy\u0027s expense. Were they going to lead me all over the damn rig searching for the galley? I cursed myself for letting the helicopter leave without me.","The rig clerk, acting as the official welcoming committee, arrived right behind me. He instructed me what to do in case of an emergency. \"If there\u0027s an explosion,\" he said, \"run to whatever platform isn\u0027t burning.\"","I eyed the dozens of other oil rigs that stood 5, 10, 20 miles across the watery plain. Some appeared no bigger than a blip on the horizon. I wondered a lot about the galley hands on those rigs who were staring back at the blip that was our rig.","\"I\u0027m not sure.\"","\"Well, I\u0027d have to go outside and check on it.\"","\"You don\u0027t? Why not?\"","The more I stared out at the Gulf, the more transfixed I became by the water. There was water as far as I could see, in all directions. I was surrounded by it. I was trapped by it. My hands soaked in it. I drank it constantly. The more I stared at the water, the less I understood it.","[UNINTELLIGIBLE] the company that supplied galley hands for oil rigs in a small town outside New Orleans. I filled out a bunch of paperwork and sat around with a half dozen other applicants. When my name was finally called, I walked down a hall to where a guy greeted me.","I was helpless until, almost magically, the door opened from the inside. In front of me stood the guy I had seen through the window. \"[BLEEP], son,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t just stand there playing with yourself. Come on in.\" He introduced himself as Redneck, the galley steward. My boss.","\"That\u0027s right. When you\u0027re on call, and the dispatcher calls and tells you to be down at the coast in three hours, you have to be there. We can\u0027t wait for you to find a car to borrow or to find someone to drive you.\"","After a few more of these encounters over the next couple of days, I finally realized what was going on. The rig hands, after working a gritty shift of roustabouting and roughnecking, expected to be greeted in the galley with some witty remark or joke, maybe even a song or dance. They expected the galley hand to provide some comic relief, like a court jester. What they got instead was me washing dishes and staring out at the sea.","Redneck was never at ease. He raced back and forth across the tiny kitchen when he cooked, a constant stream of chatter flowing from his lips. He was a fun and funny guy, but he had a nervous edge that was attributed by all, including himself, to the seven years he spent as a CIA mercenary in southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. I never saw Redneck sit down for more than 30 seconds before he jumped up again and resumed his frantic pacing.","I thought back to the day I landed on the rig. At the end of my first shift, Cookie, the night cook, had asked me, \"This your first day on a rig?\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Well, the first day is the worst, and all the rest are just the same.\"","\"I have to own a car to wash dishes on an oil rig?\"","I stepped outside and wrote down the license plate number of a car that I hoped wasn\u0027t his, and then went back in and gave it to him. Minutes later, I was issued a hard hat, safety glasses, and two work shirts. I was now officially on call.","My gaze was broken by Redneck repeatedly saying, \"Hey, pardner. Hey, pardner!\" I didn\u0027t initially recognize my new nickname. \"Hey, pardner,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t [BLEEP] cuss much, do you?\" \"No,\" I answered. \"Not really.\" \"Well [BLEEP],\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to mother[BLEEP] cuss for the both of us, then.\" And he did. Then it was time for lunch.","Redneck explained that, despite the fact that the rig was comprised of three connected platforms, the crew was actually pretty small. Altogether, there were about 30 people to be fed. Their mealtimes were staggered. So there were never more than five or six guys in the galley at any given time. This slow but steady pace applied to the dishes as well. There were always dishes for me to wash, but never any rush to get them done.","\"Great.

I mean, he had good features-- tall, wavy brown hair, lanky build-- but there always seemed to be this kind of beaten quality to Bud-- in his sad smile, stooped shoulders, pear shape-- as though he were being flogged by life. Sexually, Bud Kemp was an inert object.","That perception changed dramatically one night early in the summer of my 31st year. Although not really intimate, Bud and I were in the habit of going to the movies every Thursday night. This movie night tradition had been started by a little dorm group in college, although of course as members drifted towards 30, pairing up or marrying people from the outside, they\u0027d left Bud, I, and movie night behind.","No doubt, Bud had also tried to leave Bud, I, and movie night behind. I tried myself. But it was difficult. I mean, I\u0027ve never been the sort of woman who walks into a room in a Lycra mini dress, hair moussed to staggering proportion, and the men just drop dead all around. No. My charms are more subtle. I\u0027m the kind of girl guys fall back on. Tireless listener. Lender of money. Provider of Xanax. Ride to LAX. And so, as though held together by gravity, eight years later, Bud and I would still find ourselves sitting together in the darkened movie theater, clutching separate containers of popcorn, not saying a word. Hardly a date, I\u0027d think.","But one night during the opening credits, I looked over at Bud. And for the first time I realized what a sharp profile he had. What relatively clear skin. And his hands clasped together over one big knee. They were nice, too. Suddenly a phrase popped into my mind. \"The strong, capable hands of Bud Kemp.\" Strong. Capable. Silent. Could this Bud Kemp be used for sex?","So things are getting hot, if in kind of a lukewarm way.

Sting wears wire rims.","Oh, if only we could get that sensual leg thing going again. Laugh and kick out. Laugh and kick out. But there is no laughter here. Only worry and sweat. How I long for Pizza Hut with its pepperoni-laced orgy-like ambiance. Sex between two people can be such a lonely thing.","And I realize that Bud Kemp can not bring himself to face my breasts in all their terrible candor. They blaze in the darkness like headlights, illuminating the falseness of all of those movie nights. Eventually, Bud stops running and just lies there with both hands cupped over his eyes, as though expecting to be flogged. His nostrils quiver. Is that a snore?","Grimly pushing on, I tear my t-shirt off, revealing my sexy black bra, his cue to just go wild. But Bud Kemp is rubbing his eyes with both hands. Still I wait, with accusing breasts. Still Bud rubs, making that kind of faint humming sound. [HUMMING]","Bud Kemp was a guy I\u0027d known for eight years, first in college, then at the pharmaceutical corporation where I worked. I had always thought of Bud as a nice guy, and not unattractive. Not exactly attractive, either. I mean, he had good features-- tall, wavy brown hair, lanky build-- but there always seemed to be this kind of beaten quality to Bud-- in his sad smile, stooped shoulders, pear shape-- as though he were being flogged by life. Sexually, Bud Kemp was an inert object.","We are using secret code now. Bud Kemp and I are talking, moving as one. I sense almost by telepathy he wants to swing by the Lucky for a six pack. We skate effortlessly through the gleaming, luminescent supermarket aisles like Torvilll and Dean. We pause calmly, almost worshipfully, before the glass refrigerator cases, which present their dramatic panoramas. Endless vistas of possibility. Heineken, Dos Equis, Tsingtao, Kirin, Moosehead, Foster\u0027s. The whole world is ours, literally, through beer.","My team, the Fly Balls, is composed mostly of the four Fs of the softball universe. Skinny guys in Greenpeace teachers, reluctant wives and girlfriends, little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] from the mailroom. No wonder today we are being beaten, whipped dominated by Terminator 2000, the league leaders. Pitching for them today? Bud Kemp.","So things are getting hot, if in kind of a lukewarm way. The coming of our pharmaceutical corporation\u0027s summer softball league in Torrance makes them even hotter. Oh yeah. Once a year, summer softball provides we who labor in sector D7 with an excuse to just go wild. Wear funny raccoon hats with our team names on them, yell \"whoo, whoo\" for no reason at all."]}},"actMap":{"1":{"actNumber":1,"actName":"Prologue","contributorMap":{"Ira Glass":{"name":"Ira Glass","episodes":{"115":"First Day"},"statements":["Think for a minute about your first day.

Never work at a job where I can\u0027t quit and leave the moment the notion struck me. For 10 years, ever since I had established the fundamental rule, I had never broken it.","[UNINTELLIGIBLE] the company that supplied galley hands for oil rigs in a small town outside New Orleans. I filled out a bunch of paperwork and sat around with a half dozen other applicants. When my name was finally called, I walked down a hall to where a guy greeted me.","Too stunned to catch his name, I could only stare at him and think, \"My god, it\u0027s Bill Clinton.\" He was an absolute dead ringer for Bill Clinton. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off him as he led me into his office. The resemblance was remarkable. He had the same puffy cheeks, the same dimpled chin, and the same salt and pepper hair and haircut. He even had that familiar Clinton smirk, only this guy\u0027s smirk seemed to say, I know you think I look like Clinton, and you\u0027re dying to ask me about it.","The Clinton clone said, I had left a couple things blank on my application, such as the make and license plate number of my car. \"I don\u0027t have a car,\" I said.","\"You don\u0027t? Why not?\"","\"Um, I guess I just don\u0027t need one.\"","\"Well, you need one for this job. In fact, owning a car is the most important qualification for being a galley hand.\"","\"I have to own a car to wash dishes on an oil rig?\"","\"That\u0027s right. When you\u0027re on call, and the dispatcher calls and tells you to be down at the coast in three hours, you have to be there. We can\u0027t wait for you to find a car to borrow or to find someone to drive you.\"","\"Oh, well, in that case, I do own a car.\"","\"Great. What kind?\"","\"It\u0027s a station wagon.\"","\"And what\u0027s the license plate number?\"","\"I\u0027m not sure.\"","\"You don\u0027t know your own license plate number?\"","\"Well, I\u0027d have to go outside and check on it.\"","\"You go do that, then.\"","I stepped outside and wrote down the license plate number of a car that I hoped wasn\u0027t his, and then went back in and gave it to him. Minutes later, I was issued a hard hat, safety glasses, and two work shirts. I was now officially on call.","I spent the rest of the afternoon walking back to the city, grasping at my last fleeting moments of freedom. I was on the verge of breaking the fundamental rule, and could foresee only disaster. To make my fretting worse, the next day a friend of a friend, who claimed to be familiar with life on the oil rigs, told me I could expect to be hazed. As if overcoming my occupational claustrophobia wasn\u0027t enough, I was going to have to put up with idiots hazing me, as well.","Two days later, I was flown to an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The helicopter approached the center of three connected platforms and landed on the roof of its uppermost structure. I asked the pilot, \"Where would I find the galley?\" \"Go down those stairs, and someone will show you,\" he said. I took off my headset, put on my hardhat and safety glasses, grabbed my bag, and hopped out. I held the door open, reluctant to break my link to the outside world. \"So where did you say the galley was?\" I shouted over the roar of the whirling blades. \"Just go down those stairs,\" the pilot shouted back. \"Shut the door.\"","I shut the door and ran across the roof. As I dashed down the stairs, the helicopter revved up. I paused momentarily, but resisted the temptation to run back up to the roof. The fundamental rule had been broken. There was nothing left to do but face the consequences.","Down the stairs, I popped my head through an open door and asked a guy which way to the galley. \"Go this way and that,\" he said. \"Down these stairs and those. Can\u0027t miss it.\" I followed his directions and found myself out in the middle of the platform, surrounded by cargo containers and pipes and assorted industrial junk.","\"You passed it. The door is back that way.\" A guy in a tiny window of one of the cargo containers pointed back the way I came. I looked, but didn\u0027t find any doors. Apparently, a little fun was already being had at the new guy\u0027s expense. Were they going to lead me all over the damn rig searching for the galley? I cursed myself for letting the helicopter leave without me.","Then I noticed a piece of cardboard that had scrawled handwriting written on it. It read, \"Keep out. This means you. Wet floor. Signed, Redneck.\" The sign hung from what I realized was a door handle. I tugged and pulled and turned the handle every which way, but couldn\u0027t get the damn door to budge. I was so green, I couldn\u0027t even unlock a simple latch.","I was helpless until, almost magically, the door opened from the inside. In front of me stood the guy I had seen through the window. \"[BLEEP], son,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t just stand there playing with yourself. Come on in.\" He introduced himself as Redneck, the galley steward. My boss.","I stepped inside and asked him where the galley was. \"Man, you\u0027re in the mother[BLEEP] galley,\" he scoffed. Looking around, I was pretty sure he had to be putting me on. Even though I could see a small kitchen, the whole space was barely bigger than the kitchen and dining room of a house.","\"Where does everybody eat, then?\" I asked.","\"Right [BLEEP] there,\" Redneck said, kicking one of the two benches that faced the counter along one wall. Obviously, 100 employees couldn\u0027t fit on those two benches, but since he seemed to think I was gullible, I played along. \"Yeah, OK,\" I said.","The rig clerk, acting as the official welcoming committee, arrived right behind me. He instructed me what to do in case of an emergency. \"If there\u0027s an explosion,\" he said, \"run to whatever platform isn\u0027t burning.\"","Redneck, as I would later learn he insisted on being called, introduced me to Cuz, the other galley hand, who was mopping the kitchen. My job instructions from Redneck were simple. \"As long as you keep them [BLEEP] dishes clean, there ain\u0027t a mother[BLEEP] on this rig who\u0027d give you [BLEEP].\"","After a brief tour of the small kitchen, Redneck showed me to my station. I stepped up to the sinks and assumed by preferred dishwashing stance. Looking straight ahead, I saw heaven. Right there above the sinks, perfectly at eye level, was a porthole. I immediately knew that this little window to the world would play a huge role in helping me survive for two weeks without quitting. I looked out at the endless expanse of the Gulf of Mexico. There wasn\u0027t much to look at-- a whole lot of sea, a whole lot of sky, and dozens of rigs off in the distance-- but already, I felt at ease.","My gaze was broken by Redneck repeatedly saying, \"Hey, pardner. Hey, pardner!\" I didn\u0027t initially recognize my new nickname. \"Hey, pardner,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t [BLEEP] cuss much, do you?\" \"No,\" I answered. \"Not really.\" \"Well [BLEEP],\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to mother[BLEEP] cuss for the both of us, then.\" And he did. Then it was time for lunch.","Redneck explained that, despite the fact that the rig was comprised of three connected platforms, the crew was actually pretty small. Altogether, there were about 30 people to be fed. Their mealtimes were staggered. So there were never more than five or six guys in the galley at any given time. This slow but steady pace applied to the dishes as well. There were always dishes for me to wash, but never any rush to get them done.","Several times during lunch, crew hands walked up to me in the kitchen with big grins on their faces and asked, \"How\u0027s it going, bro?\" \"OK,\" I\u0027d shrug. They waited. For what, I had no idea. They waited, and then they grew irritated with me and stomped out of the kitchen. One guy said, \"What\u0027s this quiet-ass mother[BLEEP]\u0027s problem, Redneck?\" \"He likes looking out that [BLEEP] window. What can I say?\" I didn\u0027t understand. I washed the dishes, I looked out the window, I minded my own business, just as Redneck had instructed. Why would anyone have a problem with that?","After a few more of these encounters over the next couple of days, I finally realized what was going on. The rig hands, after working a gritty shift of roustabouting and roughnecking, expected to be greeted in the galley with some witty remark or joke, maybe even a song or dance. They expected the galley hand to provide some comic relief, like a court jester. What they got instead was me washing dishes and staring out at the sea.","Well, too bad. I wasn\u0027t there to entertain anyone. If I wanted a job shucking and jiving for diners, I would have become a waiter.","Redneck was never at ease. He raced back and forth across the tiny kitchen when he cooked, a constant stream of chatter flowing from his lips. He was a fun and funny guy, but he had a nervous edge that was attributed by all, including himself, to the seven years he spent as a CIA mercenary in southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. I never saw Redneck sit down for more than 30 seconds before he jumped up again and resumed his frantic pacing.","He grew especially nervous when he and I were alone in the galley, and I stood staring out my porthole. \"Goddamn, pardner! Say [BLEEP] something!\" If I had nothing to say, usually I just cursed, since he got a kick out of that. \"[BLEEP] it,\" I\u0027d say. \"You got that right, pardner,\" he\u0027d laugh. \"[BLEEP] it.\" Then, after further contemplation, he\u0027d add, \"Mother[BLEEP] it.\"","Not an hour passed without Redneck raising one of his favorite topics for discussion, sex with farm animals. Redneck was raised on a farm in Arkansas, and was quite knowledgeable about having sex with farm animals, and wasn\u0027t stingy with this information.

For hours on end, I watched the endless expanse of water slosh up and down, back and forth, as the parade of fish, porpoises, seaweed, stingrays, driftwood, and jellyfish swam and floated past.

I took off my headset, put on my hardhat and safety glasses, grabbed my bag, and hopped out.

I was on the verge of breaking the fundamental rule, and could foresee only disaster. To make my fretting worse, the next day a friend of a friend, who claimed to be familiar with life on the oil rigs, told me I could expect to be hazed. As if overcoming my occupational claustrophobia wasn\u0027t enough, I was going to have to put up with idiots hazing me, as well.","\"Oh, well, in that case, I do own a car.\"","He grew especially nervous when he and I were alone in the galley, and I stood staring out my porthole. \"Goddamn, pardner!

I stepped up to the sinks and assumed by preferred dishwashing stance. Looking straight ahead, I saw heaven. Right there above the sinks, perfectly at eye level, was a porthole. I immediately knew that this little window to the world would play a huge role in helping me survive for two weeks without quitting. I looked out at the endless expanse of the Gulf of Mexico. There wasn\u0027t much to look at-- a whole lot of sea, a whole lot of sky, and dozens of rigs off in the distance-- but already, I felt at ease.","\"You go do that, then.\"","Well, too bad. I wasn\u0027t there to entertain anyone. If I wanted a job shucking and jiving for diners, I would have become a waiter.","\"Right [BLEEP] there,\" Redneck said, kicking one of the two benches that faced the counter along one wall. Obviously, 100 employees couldn\u0027t fit on those two benches, but since he seemed to think I was gullible, I played along. \"Yeah, OK,\" I said.","Basically, the rule is this. Never work at a job where I can\u0027t quit and leave the moment the notion struck me. For 10 years, ever since I had established the fundamental rule, I had never broken it.","I stepped inside and asked him where the galley was. \"Man, you\u0027re in the mother[BLEEP] galley,\" he scoffed. Looking around, I was pretty sure he had to be putting me on. Even though I could see a small kitchen, the whole space was barely bigger than the kitchen and dining room of a house.","I shut the door and ran across the roof. As I dashed down the stairs, the helicopter revved up. I paused momentarily, but resisted the temptation to run back up to the roof. The fundamental rule had been broken. There was nothing left to do but face the consequences.","\"You passed it. The door is back that way.\" A guy in a tiny window of one of the cargo containers pointed back the way I came.

They expected the galley hand to provide some comic relief, like a court jester. What they got instead was me washing dishes and staring out at the sea.","Redneck was never at ease. He raced back and forth across the tiny kitchen when he cooked, a constant stream of chatter flowing from his lips.

When corporations try to act like high school freshmen. Bad sex, bad radio stations, and the power of a fuzzy navel.

Saturday night in this village. Really quiet. Super cold. And this call came over for unknown animal in a house. And it was on my post. It was about five minutes away.","So myself and another car were assigned the call. And we show up there. And luckily for me, it was another guy who was pretty new. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on. The nylon coat, the vest, the belt, the whole nine yards.","And the door opens, and the guy who is behind the door, he\u0027s about 30. I was 23 at the time. He\u0027s about 30. He looks like a broker, a lawyer. Just really well put together. A nice guy wearing glasses. He\u0027s wearing these silk pajamas with a monogram. Got my attention. And he\u0027s going, listen, I\u0027m really sorry to bother you. Normally I\u0027d handle this sort of stuff on my own. But my wife really insisted I call.","And so we ask him what the problem is. He says, well, we were having kind of a romantic evening down in the living room, and we heard this scratching upstairs. So I ran upstairs to see what it was. And it turns out it\u0027s coming from the attic. There\u0027s something up there, and it\u0027s just running around, knocking a few small things over. I can\u0027t tell what it is. It could be a squirrel or raccoon. I really don\u0027t know.","So the other cop that I was with said, well, you know, we really don\u0027t handle that. It\u0027s not so much a police function. But we do have numbers of these private contractors who will come in and they\u0027ll put a humane trap down, and they\u0027ll remove the animal for you. It\u0027s really not such a big deal. But it\u0027s really not our thing.","So right as he was in the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook, the guy swings the door back, and there is his wife, who was just beautiful. She was beautiful. She was probably about 26 or 27, but just really beautiful. Perfect skin, long blond hair, great teeth, brilliant blue eyes, a really nice smile. Just, like, beautiful and friendly. You know? If she had said, eat this broken glass, I just would have said, OK, broken glass it is. It\u0027s fine.","But she seemed really nice. So I was going to be, like, Galahad. So I just threw my arm back into this guy\u0027s chest, into my partner\u0027s chest. And I said, Mark, we can handle this. It\u0027ll be OK.","And she was just, oh, thank you so much. And she was really sweet. And I was, like, struck dead. So we walk inside. And she goes, I\u0027m going to throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs. We follow the man of the house upstairs. And we\u0027re underneath one of those trapdoors that goes into the attic with the staircase that folds out.","And we do hear an animal upstairs scratching away, just kind of scuttling around the floor. And there\u0027s definitely something up there. And it\u0027s making pretty good speed going from one end of the roof to the other. So I reached up, and I took the trapdoor down. We unfolded the ladder.","Now I have this big, heavy flashlight, your cop flashlight. The 4 D-cells, the metal case, the whole thing. I shine it up through the hole in there. And it\u0027s pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the latter. Now, the guy who owned the house is standing almost directly underneath me, just to the side of the latter, looking straight up at me. And my partner\u0027s at the base of the latter, right behind me.","So just before I stuck my head through this black hole, I just kind of pause. I crunch my body up underneath, because I\u0027m realizing, gee, I don\u0027t know where this thing is. The second we pulled down the trap door, all noise upstairs just ceased. So I was kind of nervous. And I was like, well, you know, I look like an idiot, just crouched up here on the top of the ladder. So I took the flashlight, and I just popped my head up, turned the light on again.","And about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel, at eye level with me, kind of reared back on its legs. And I swear, from where I was standing, it looked like Godzilla. It just scared the heck out of me. I thought, it\u0027s a squirrel. It\u0027s going to be hiding somewhere. It\u0027s going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me. And it really startled me. So I kind of went, \"ah!\" And jumped back.","And the flashlight slips out of my hands-- and it\u0027s heavy-- and it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who\u0027s looking straight up at me. And I don\u0027t think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose-- his hands up to his face, blood just started pouring out between his hands.","This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards, directly onto my partner, and I just pancake him. We\u0027re both our backs. He\u0027s on his back. I\u0027m on his stomach, on my back, scuttling around like a beetle, trying to get up in this really narrow hallway. It\u0027s a mess.","The squirrel, while we\u0027re floundering around in the hallway, jumps down the stairs-- boink, boink, boink-- lands on me, and takes off down the stairs.","It was terrible. It was terrible. So we\u0027re wondering, gee, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, you hear her scream. So my partner goes, well, we found the squirrel. It\u0027s wherever she is.","So we go running downstairs. And the squirrel had come into the living room, where they had been having their romantic evening. They had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around one corner of the couch next to the fire, and they had champagne flutes out. Nice house. Really nice. I mean, it just smelled brand new. New carpeting, new rugs, new paint. They hadn\u0027t been there for that long.","So the squirrel, when it bolted down the staircase, took off into the living room and ran underneath the couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is bleeding all over the place, on his carpets. His wife looks and says, what have you done to my husband? I start going, oh, it was an accident-- and then I just stop in mid-sentence. What\u0027s the point? We\u0027ve only been there about two minutes.","So the squirrel is underneath the couch. And my partner is going, let\u0027s get out of here. This is just-- it\u0027s not going well. So I am not beaten yet. I always have another idea.","So the squirrel is under this couch, which in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don\u0027t we move the furniture away from one of the corners? And we\u0027ll put the catch in the corner. And the squirrel will probably move along with the couch, because it\u0027s the only cover available to it. And once we get into the corner, we\u0027ll only have two open sides of the couch to worry about. So we did that.","Yes. Yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instant. But you know.","I asked her for a box. And she says, sure, we\u0027ve got boxes. We just moved in. We have nothing but boxes. She runs out to the garage. And she comes back with a box. And the box is long enough. And it fits across the entire short side of the couch, where the armrests would be. So I start sweeping underneath the couch with my nightstick, trying to move the squirrel toward the box. Figuring we\u0027ll capture it and just get rid of it. And we\u0027ll be out of here. And there\u0027ll be no more mayhem.","So it\u0027s actually working very well. And the squirrel\u0027s moving down along. You can hear it. It\u0027s chittering. And I\u0027m trying not to hurt it. I\u0027m nervous about the thing. It might bite me. I don\u0027t want to hurt it, really. It\u0027s just an animal.","So I\u0027m moving it along. And everything\u0027s going very well. And then with about eight inches to go, I took one more swipe, and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch. It was lined with tassels. I couldn\u0027t really see under the couch. It bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. The fireplace was directly head of it, and it ran into the fire, and caught on fire, and ran directly back out, and directly back under the couch.","It was on fire. Yeah. The tail, the bushy fur, the whole bit. I mean, it wasn\u0027t, like, flaming or anything. But it was smoking. And there was a little bit of fire coming off the tail. So it runs back under the couch. And the couch catches on fire in seconds. I mean, in seconds. It must have had dust under there or something else. But it just caught on fire immediately.","And my partner and I just don\u0027t even talk. We just grab the couch, heave it upside down. And now there\u0027s plenty of oxygen for the fire to really get going. And it starts up. And we\u0027re patting it out. And it\u0027s sort of getting away from us. So we grab the only thing that\u0027s really available. And those are these really nice silk pillows. And we have one in each hand, the both of us. And we\u0027re just windmilling away at this fire on the couch. And we put it out.","But it\u0027s smoking terribly. And it was just a disaster. The couch is upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filling with smoke from the couch. The squirrel, when it went under the couch, in its death throes, just latched on to the bottom of the couch. It\u0027s like this smoking piece of gristle underneath the couch, latched on there with its claws. And we\u0027re pounding, smearing it all over the place. And the smoke alarms are firing away. The guy is standing with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose, which is still bleeding. His pajamas are a mess. They\u0027re covered with blood, the front of them.","And we finally get the fire out. And we\u0027re both completely red. Sweating, because we\u0027re dressed for like zero degree weather, and it\u0027s hot there, by the fire. We\u0027re mortified. The house is full of smoke.","The wife just looks around and just starts to cry. She goes, what have you done? What have you done to my house? You can see her just clicking things off on the fingers. OK. The dead squirrel, ruined pillows, need a new couch, the walls are covered with soot, the fire alarms are going off, my husband\u0027s disfigured. And then she really kind of just lost it.","And he was just looking at us and shaking his head, like he couldn\u0027t believe that these two idiots showed up and did this to his house over nothing, really. And he just goes, you know, you really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I can\u0027t point to any one thing that you did that I have a reason to get angry about. You really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I mean, we did call you. But I just, I can\u0027t thank you for this. They call for a squirrel. They end up with $3,000, $4,000 worth of damage and a broken nose. And this is all within about five minutes.","There\u0027s always a new mistake to be made. I don\u0027t think I would make that particular mistake. I mean, you make plenty of mistakes. That\u0027s just part of that job. You just try not to make the same one twice. But there\u0027s such variety that you\u0027re going to make hundreds, you\u0027re going to make thousands of mistakes, until you really get a handle on what you\u0027re doing.","Right. And with police work, they afford you plenty of space to make mistakes. But there are things that just aren\u0027t your responsibility-- if you get involved in things that aren\u0027t your responsibility, or that you\u0027re really not equipped to handle, or that you don\u0027t have a specific plan-- a plan that\u0027s thought through to a conclusion-- you probably should reevaluate what you\u0027re doing.","That\u0027s a great question. I guess I was thinking that I would go up there in the attic, and find this cowering squirrel, and somehow kind of lure it into some kind of trap, and then walk out with it and be like a hero. But as it turned out, it was a Pyrrhic victory for the squirrel, but the squirrel definitely won. The squirrel really kicked our ass.","No, no. It took me a long time to even tell people about it, you know? I was so new. I didn\u0027t want to know what a bonehead I was when I first came onto the job.","What I thought it would be was one adventure after another, kind of. And that sounds childish. But that\u0027s sort of what I did envision. And then one of the very first days I was on, I had the school crossing where I used to go to school. So at 23, I was crossing these kids where I had went to grammar school and I went to high school. Freezing cold. And I knew just about every third or fourth car that went by. And everyone\u0027s beeping and honking. And there was some slush on the ground.","And my mother drove by. And she stopped in the middle of the intersection. And she goes, what are you doing out here without a hat on?","Not at all. Not at all.","You know, she just, what are you doing out here without a hat on? Mom, I have the hat I\u0027m supposed to wear. She\u0027s like, but it doesn\u0027t cover your ears. It\u0027s freezing out here.","And that\u0027s when I started to realize, hey, this isn\u0027t all about car chases and everything else. It\u0027s just like living at home."],"spokenWords":["But she seemed really nice. So I was going to be, like, Galahad.

We have this story from a police officer, now a veteran of the force, in a suburban community on the East Coast."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"There was nothing, nothing going on. Saturday night in this village. Really quiet. Super cold. And this call came over for unknown animal in a house. And it was on my post. It was about five minutes away."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So myself and another car were assigned the call. And we show up there. And luckily for me, it was another guy who was pretty new. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on. The nylon coat, the vest, the belt, the whole nine yards."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And the door opens, and the guy who is behind the door, he\u0027s about 30. I was 23 at the time. He\u0027s about 30. He looks like a broker, a lawyer. Just really well put together. A nice guy wearing glasses. He\u0027s wearing these silk pajamas with a monogram. Got my attention. And he\u0027s going, listen, I\u0027m really sorry to bother you. Normally I\u0027d handle this sort of stuff on my own. But my wife really insisted I call."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And so we ask him what the problem is. He says, well, we were having kind of a romantic evening down in the living room, and we heard this scratching upstairs. So I ran upstairs to see what it was. And it turns out it\u0027s coming from the attic. There\u0027s something up there, and it\u0027s just running around, knocking a few small things over. I can\u0027t tell what it is. It could be a squirrel or raccoon. I really don\u0027t know."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the other cop that I was with said, well, you know, we really don\u0027t handle that. It\u0027s not so much a police function. But we do have numbers of these private contractors who will come in and they\u0027ll put a humane trap down, and they\u0027ll remove the animal for you. It\u0027s really not such a big deal. But it\u0027s really not our thing."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So right as he was in the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook, the guy swings the door back, and there is his wife, who was just beautiful. She was beautiful. She was probably about 26 or 27, but just really beautiful. Perfect skin, long blond hair, great teeth, brilliant blue eyes, a really nice smile. Just, like, beautiful and friendly. You know? If she had said, eat this broken glass, I just would have said, OK, broken glass it is. It\u0027s fine."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"But she seemed really nice. So I was going to be, like, Galahad. So I just threw my arm back into this guy\u0027s chest, into my partner\u0027s chest. And I said, Mark, we can handle this. It\u0027ll be OK."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And she was just, oh, thank you so much. And she was really sweet. And I was, like, struck dead. So we walk inside. And she goes, I\u0027m going to throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs. We follow the man of the house upstairs. And we\u0027re underneath one of those trapdoors that goes into the attic with the staircase that folds out."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And we do hear an animal upstairs scratching away, just kind of scuttling around the floor. And there\u0027s definitely something up there. And it\u0027s making pretty good speed going from one end of the roof to the other. So I reached up, and I took the trapdoor down. We unfolded the ladder."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Now I have this big, heavy flashlight, your cop flashlight. The 4 D-cells, the metal case, the whole thing. I shine it up through the hole in there. And it\u0027s pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the latter. Now, the guy who owned the house is standing almost directly underneath me, just to the side of the latter, looking straight up at me. And my partner\u0027s at the base of the latter, right behind me."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So just before I stuck my head through this black hole, I just kind of pause. I crunch my body up underneath, because I\u0027m realizing, gee, I don\u0027t know where this thing is. The second we pulled down the trap door, all noise upstairs just ceased. So I was kind of nervous. And I was like, well, you know, I look like an idiot, just crouched up here on the top of the ladder. So I took the flashlight, and I just popped my head up, turned the light on again."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel, at eye level with me, kind of reared back on its legs. And I swear, from where I was standing, it looked like Godzilla. It just scared the heck out of me. I thought, it\u0027s a squirrel. It\u0027s going to be hiding somewhere. It\u0027s going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me. And it really startled me. So I kind of went, \"ah!\" And jumped back."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And the flashlight slips out of my hands-- and it\u0027s heavy-- and it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who\u0027s looking straight up at me. And I don\u0027t think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose-- his hands up to his face, blood just started pouring out between his hands."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is the homeowner?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards, directly onto my partner, and I just pancake him. We\u0027re both our backs. He\u0027s on his back. I\u0027m on his stomach, on my back, scuttling around like a beetle, trying to get up in this really narrow hallway. It\u0027s a mess."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"The squirrel, while we\u0027re floundering around in the hallway, jumps down the stairs-- boink, boink, boink-- lands on me, and takes off down the stairs."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How undignified."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"It was terrible. It was terrible. So we\u0027re wondering, gee, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, you hear her scream. So my partner goes, well, we found the squirrel. It\u0027s wherever she is."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So we go running downstairs. And the squirrel had come into the living room, where they had been having their romantic evening. They had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around one corner of the couch next to the fire, and they had champagne flutes out. Nice house. Really nice. I mean, it just smelled brand new. New carpeting, new rugs, new paint. They hadn\u0027t been there for that long."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the squirrel, when it bolted down the staircase, took off into the living room and ran underneath the couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is bleeding all over the place, on his carpets. His wife looks and says, what have you done to my husband? I start going, oh, it was an accident-- and then I just stop in mid-sentence. What\u0027s the point? We\u0027ve only been there about two minutes."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the squirrel is underneath the couch. And my partner is going, let\u0027s get out of here. This is just-- it\u0027s not going well. So I am not beaten yet. I always have another idea."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the squirrel is under this couch, which in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don\u0027t we move the furniture away from one of the corners? And we\u0027ll put the catch in the corner. And the squirrel will probably move along with the couch, because it\u0027s the only cover available to it. And once we get into the corner, we\u0027ll only have two open sides of the couch to worry about. So we did that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That is so tactical."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Yes. Yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instant. But you know."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"I asked her for a box. And she says, sure, we\u0027ve got boxes. We just moved in. We have nothing but boxes. She runs out to the garage. And she comes back with a box. And the box is long enough. And it fits across the entire short side of the couch, where the armrests would be. So I start sweeping underneath the couch with my nightstick, trying to move the squirrel toward the box. Figuring we\u0027ll capture it and just get rid of it. And we\u0027ll be out of here. And there\u0027ll be no more mayhem."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So it\u0027s actually working very well. And the squirrel\u0027s moving down along. You can hear it. It\u0027s chittering. And I\u0027m trying not to hurt it. I\u0027m nervous about the thing. It might bite me. I don\u0027t want to hurt it, really. It\u0027s just an animal."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So I\u0027m moving it along. And everything\u0027s going very well. And then with about eight inches to go, I took one more swipe, and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch. It was lined with tassels. I couldn\u0027t really see under the couch. It bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. The fireplace was directly head of it, and it ran into the fire, and caught on fire, and ran directly back out, and directly back under the couch."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Is it on fire?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"It was on fire. Yeah. The tail, the bushy fur, the whole bit. I mean, it wasn\u0027t, like, flaming or anything. But it was smoking. And there was a little bit of fire coming off the tail. So it runs back under the couch. And the couch catches on fire in seconds. I mean, in seconds. It must have had dust under there or something else. But it just caught on fire immediately."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And my partner and I just don\u0027t even talk. We just grab the couch, heave it upside down. And now there\u0027s plenty of oxygen for the fire to really get going. And it starts up. And we\u0027re patting it out. And it\u0027s sort of getting away from us. So we grab the only thing that\u0027s really available. And those are these really nice silk pillows. And we have one in each hand, the both of us. And we\u0027re just windmilling away at this fire on the couch. And we put it out."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"But it\u0027s smoking terribly. And it was just a disaster. The couch is upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filling with smoke from the couch. The squirrel, when it went under the couch, in its death throes, just latched on to the bottom of the couch. It\u0027s like this smoking piece of gristle underneath the couch, latched on there with its claws. And we\u0027re pounding, smearing it all over the place. And the smoke alarms are firing away. The guy is standing with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose, which is still bleeding. His pajamas are a mess. They\u0027re covered with blood, the front of them."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And we finally get the fire out. And we\u0027re both completely red. Sweating, because we\u0027re dressed for like zero degree weather, and it\u0027s hot there, by the fire. We\u0027re mortified. The house is full of smoke."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"The wife just looks around and just starts to cry. She goes, what have you done? What have you done to my house? You can see her just clicking things off on the fingers. OK. The dead squirrel, ruined pillows, need a new couch, the walls are covered with soot, the fire alarms are going off, my husband\u0027s disfigured. And then she really kind of just lost it."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And he was just looking at us and shaking his head, like he couldn\u0027t believe that these two idiots showed up and did this to his house over nothing, really. And he just goes, you know, you really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I can\u0027t point to any one thing that you did that I have a reason to get angry about. You really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I mean, we did call you. But I just, I can\u0027t thank you for this. They call for a squirrel. They end up with $3,000, $4,000 worth of damage and a broken nose. And this is all within about five minutes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Could that have happened to you now, 13 years later?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"There\u0027s always a new mistake to be made. I don\u0027t think I would make that particular mistake. I mean, you make plenty of mistakes. That\u0027s just part of that job. You just try not to make the same one twice. But there\u0027s such variety that you\u0027re going to make hundreds, you\u0027re going to make thousands of mistakes, until you really get a handle on what you\u0027re doing."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That\u0027s interesting. That is a very particular thing about a new job. Is that in order to learn the job, you literally have to make the mistakes. There\u0027s no way around it."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Right. And with police work, they afford you plenty of space to make mistakes. But there are things that just aren\u0027t your responsibility-- if you get involved in things that aren\u0027t your responsibility, or that you\u0027re really not equipped to handle, or that you don\u0027t have a specific plan-- a plan that\u0027s thought through to a conclusion-- you probably should reevaluate what you\u0027re doing."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah, now that you mentioned that, that\u0027s right. You walked into the house, thinking, OK. We\u0027ll get this squirrel. Like, how were you going to get the squirrel? What was the best case scenario?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"That\u0027s a great question. I guess I was thinking that I would go up there in the attic, and find this cowering squirrel, and somehow kind of lure it into some kind of trap, and then walk out with it and be like a hero. But as it turned out, it was a Pyrrhic victory for the squirrel, but the squirrel definitely won. The squirrel really kicked our ass."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That is not what you want to be saying at the end of the day."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"No, no. It took me a long time to even tell people about it, you know? I was so new. I didn\u0027t want to know what a bonehead I was when I first came onto the job."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Describe what you thought police work was going to be the day that you entered the academy."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"What I thought it would be was one adventure after another, kind of. And that sounds childish. But that\u0027s sort of what I did envision. And then one of the very first days I was on, I had the school crossing where I used to go to school. So at 23, I was crossing these kids where I had went to grammar school and I went to high school. Freezing cold. And I knew just about every third or fourth car that went by. And everyone\u0027s beeping and honking. And there was some slush on the ground."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And my mother drove by. And she stopped in the middle of the intersection. And she goes, what are you doing out here without a hat on?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Loud enough for others to hear?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Not at all. Not at all."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Thank goodness for that."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"You know, she just, what are you doing out here without a hat on? Mom, I have the hat I\u0027m supposed to wear. She\u0027s like, but it doesn\u0027t cover your ears. It\u0027s freezing out here."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And that\u0027s when I started to realize, hey, this isn\u0027t all about car chases and everything else.

They live in Los Angeles."]},"Sandra Tsing Loh":{"name":"Sandra Tsing Loh","episodes":{"115":"First Day"},"statements":["Act Three, Bad Sex with Bud Kemp.","Bud Kemp was a guy I\u0027d known for eight years, first in college, then at the pharmaceutical corporation where I worked. I had always thought of Bud as a nice guy, and not unattractive. Not exactly attractive, either. I mean, he had good features-- tall, wavy brown hair, lanky build-- but there always seemed to be this kind of beaten quality to Bud-- in his sad smile, stooped shoulders, pear shape-- as though he were being flogged by life. Sexually, Bud Kemp was an inert object.","That perception changed dramatically one night early in the summer of my 31st year. Although not really intimate, Bud and I were in the habit of going to the movies every Thursday night. This movie night tradition had been started by a little dorm group in college, although of course as members drifted towards 30, pairing up or marrying people from the outside, they\u0027d left Bud, I, and movie night behind.","No doubt, Bud had also tried to leave Bud, I, and movie night behind. I tried myself. But it was difficult. I mean, I\u0027ve never been the sort of woman who walks into a room in a Lycra mini dress, hair moussed to staggering proportion, and the men just drop dead all around. No. My charms are more subtle. I\u0027m the kind of girl guys fall back on. Tireless listener. Lender of money. Provider of Xanax. Ride to LAX. And so, as though held together by gravity, eight years later, Bud and I would still find ourselves sitting together in the darkened movie theater, clutching separate containers of popcorn, not saying a word. Hardly a date, I\u0027d think.","But one night during the opening credits, I looked over at Bud. And for the first time I realized what a sharp profile he had. What relatively clear skin. And his hands clasped together over one big knee. They were nice, too. Suddenly a phrase popped into my mind. \"The strong, capable hands of Bud Kemp.\" Strong. Capable. Silent. Could this Bud Kemp be used for sex?","So things are getting hot, if in kind of a lukewarm way. The coming of our pharmaceutical corporation\u0027s summer softball league in Torrance makes them even hotter. Oh yeah. Once a year, summer softball provides we who labor in sector D7 with an excuse to just go wild. Wear funny raccoon hats with our team names on them, yell \"whoo, whoo\" for no reason at all.","My team, the Fly Balls, is composed mostly of the four Fs of the softball universe. Skinny guys in Greenpeace teachers, reluctant wives and girlfriends, little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] from the mailroom. No wonder today we are being beaten, whipped dominated by Terminator 2000, the league leaders. Pitching for them today? Bud Kemp.","Oh, yeah. This is a little known fact about Bud Kemp. He did play a year of junior varsity basketball in college. So what if it was at a small science school with a 57-game losing streak? So what if Bud Kemp was thrown onto the court mainly for use as a human shield?","The point is, in sector D7, Bud Kemp is our sports stud. And a damned good-looking one, too. Hair faintly blonded under the sun, skin lightly tanned, and are those new glasses? God, yes. Instead of sad clown sideways teardrops, these are cool wire rims. Sting wears wire rims.","Bud steps up to the mound, pulls off his t-shirt, and his naked torso is-- OK. 33 and holding, is the triumphal message here. Although he is so Schwarzenegger, there are definite suggestions of biceps and pecs. More than suggestions. Announcements, even. Not very loud announcements, but the point is, situps are being completed, racquetball played, body parts attended to, secretly anointed, perhaps. Is it just my third fuzzy navel talking, or is Bud Kemp ready for sex?","We\u0027re at Pizza Hut now, talking and laughing. Sex is definitely in the air tonight for everyone in sector D7. Beers slosh, music thumps, lamps sway. People in funny raccoon hats worm up against each other. Bud Kemp and I are no exception. Underneath the table, thigh to thigh, sweatpant to sweatpant, we\u0027re doing kind of a sensual leg thing. Laugh and kick out. Laugh and kick out.","Obviously, it\u0027s driving him wild. \"So, you wanna go somewhere?\" he says. \"Like where, Bud?\" I say. It is so loud and wild in here, no one would notice if you tore your own bra off and used it as a lasso. My case would be the sexy black bra I\u0027d slipped on in the bathroom for a guy called Bud Kemp.","\"Away from here.\" \"How about your place?\" \"Sounds great.\" \"All righty, then.\" \"All righty.\"","We are using secret code now. Bud Kemp and I are talking, moving as one. I sense almost by telepathy he wants to swing by the Lucky for a six pack. We skate effortlessly through the gleaming, luminescent supermarket aisles like Torvilll and Dean. We pause calmly, almost worshipfully, before the glass refrigerator cases, which present their dramatic panoramas. Endless vistas of possibility. Heineken, Dos Equis, Tsingtao, Kirin, Moosehead, Foster\u0027s. The whole world is ours, literally, through beer.","He chooses Coors. I say, \"I like it too.\" \"I guess we both like it,\" he says. We both like it.","And suddenly I have a vision of Bud Kemp and I together on a Sunday morning, reading the newspaper, drinking our favorite General Foods International Coffee, Amaretto Hazelnut, the one we both like. And instead of my weekends yawning empty, I will be spending them with someone, together, liking things. First it was movies. Now it is beer. Soon it will be cars, vacations, houses, children.","This is the vision I cling onto as we returned to his condo in Long Beach, drained the beer, moved to leftover Gallo, as I sit in the living room and rub and rub and rub Bud Kemp\u0027s shoulders, and Bud Kemp talks and talks and talks about-- what else?-- Bud Kemp. \"So sometimes I wonder if I\u0027m really, really suited for a career in pharmaceuticals marketing management. I mean, what if my calling is something a bit more in the applied plastics field?\" \"What kind of plastics did you have in mind, Bud?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Single cell liposome polymer blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, me, me, me, blah, blah, blah, me, me, me, blah, blah, blah, me, me.\"","He is making me lose hold of my vision. We need to escalate things to the next level. \"Bud,\" I say, \"let\u0027s go to bed.\"","The moon slants in through the shade, transforming everything into misshapen lumps. It is uncomfortably warm and stuffy. Bud is lying on his bed, fully clothed, frozen. \"This is so weird,\" he says, \"after all this time.\"","\"I know,\" I say. \"But I think you\u0027ll like it.\"","I sit on the edge of the bed, remove one shoe, then the other. Bud Kemp does not move, make any invitation. I shove in next to him. Suddenly horny, in a kind of confused, primeval way, we grapple each other like circus bears. Bud Kemp\u0027s head is buried in my shoulder. He is stroking my hair with these odd petting motions, making this kind of humming sound. [HUMMING]","I find myself energetically massaging his shoulders. I don\u0027t know why. Move down. Lower back. Move down. Buttocks. But it seems invasive to be massaging the buttocks of such an old friend, so I find myself merely patting them as though in congratulation.","Oh, if only we could get that sensual leg thing going again. Laugh and kick out. Laugh and kick out. But there is no laughter here. Only worry and sweat. How I long for Pizza Hut with its pepperoni-laced orgy-like ambiance. Sex between two people can be such a lonely thing.","Grimly pushing on, I tear my t-shirt off, revealing my sexy black bra, his cue to just go wild. But Bud Kemp is rubbing his eyes with both hands. Still I wait, with accusing breasts. Still Bud rubs, making that kind of faint humming sound. [HUMMING]","And I realize that Bud Kemp can not bring himself to face my breasts in all their terrible candor. They blaze in the darkness like headlights, illuminating the falseness of all of those movie nights. Eventually, Bud stops running and just lies there with both hands cupped over his eyes, as though expecting to be flogged. His nostrils quiver. Is that a snore?","My idea is that we will never speak of the incident again, see each other, or even continue to live in the same state. But no. The bouquet that arrived the next morning is the ugliest I have ever seen. It is a chaos of white baby\u0027s breath, purple lupin, pink carnations, yellow daisies, all stabbing against each other in frantic counterpoint. Even worse is the card, which reads, \"I saw these flowers and thought of you. Love, Bud.\"","Love, Bud. One thing is for sure.

Although he is so Schwarzenegger, there are definite suggestions of biceps and pecs. More than suggestions. Announcements, even. Not very loud announcements, but the point is, situps are being completed, racquetball played, body parts attended to, secretly anointed, perhaps.

My case would be the sexy black bra I\u0027d slipped on in the bathroom for a guy called Bud Kemp.","Oh, yeah. This is a little known fact about Bud Kemp. He did play a year of junior varsity basketball in college. So what if it was at a small science school with a 57-game losing streak? So what if Bud Kemp was thrown onto the court mainly for use as a human shield?","That perception changed dramatically one night early in the summer of my 31st year. Although not really intimate, Bud and I were in the habit of going to the movies every Thursday night. This movie night tradition had been started by a little dorm group in college, although of course as members drifted towards 30, pairing up or marrying people from the outside, they\u0027d left Bud, I, and movie night behind.","And suddenly I have a vision of Bud Kemp and I together on a Sunday morning, reading the newspaper, drinking our favorite General Foods International Coffee, Amaretto Hazelnut, the one we both like. And instead of my weekends yawning empty, I will be spending them with someone, together, liking things. First it was movies. Now it is beer.

Laugh and kick out.","The moon slants in through the shade, transforming everything into misshapen lumps. It is uncomfortably warm and stuffy.

He is not my lovebud, and this is not me at age 31, a frantic bouquet slowly wilting.","My idea is that we will never speak of the incident again, see each other, or even continue to live in the same state.

It is a chaos of white baby\u0027s breath, purple lupin, pink carnations, yellow daisies, all stabbing against each other in frantic counterpoint. Even worse is the card, which reads, \"I saw these flowers and thought of you. Love, Bud.\"","No doubt, Bud had also tried to leave Bud, I, and movie night behind. I tried myself. But it was difficult. I mean, I\u0027ve never been the sort of woman who walks into a room in a Lycra mini dress, hair moussed to staggering proportion, and the men just drop dead all around. No. My charms are more subtle. I\u0027m the kind of girl guys fall back on. Tireless listener. Lender of money. Provider of Xanax. Ride to LAX.

Hardly a date, I\u0027d think.","I find myself energetically massaging his shoulders. I don\u0027t know why. Move down. Lower back. Move down. Buttocks. But it seems invasive to be massaging the buttocks of such an old friend, so I find myself merely patting them as though in congratulation.","The point is, in sector D7, Bud Kemp is our sports stud. And a damned good-looking one, too. Hair faintly blonded under the sun, skin lightly tanned, and are those new glasses? God, yes. Instead of sad clown sideways teardrops, these are cool wire rims. Sting wears wire rims.","Oh, if only we could get that sensual leg thing going again. Laugh and kick out. Laugh and kick out. But there is no laughter here. Only worry and sweat. How I long for Pizza Hut with its pepperoni-laced orgy-like ambiance. Sex between two people can be such a lonely thing.","And I realize that Bud Kemp can not bring himself to face my breasts in all their terrible candor. They blaze in the darkness like headlights, illuminating the falseness of all of those movie nights. Eventually, Bud stops running and just lies there with both hands cupped over his eyes, as though expecting to be flogged. His nostrils quiver. Is that a snore?","Grimly pushing on, I tear my t-shirt off, revealing my sexy black bra, his cue to just go wild. But Bud Kemp is rubbing his eyes with both hands. Still I wait, with accusing breasts. Still Bud rubs, making that kind of faint humming sound.

Sexually, Bud Kemp was an inert object.","We are using secret code now. Bud Kemp and I are talking, moving as one. I sense almost by telepathy he wants to swing by the Lucky for a six pack. We skate effortlessly through the gleaming, luminescent supermarket aisles like Torvilll and Dean.

The story starts when I was in my car. And I just realized that I have my preset station buttons arranged in order of preference. One, two, three, four, five, six. And so I sort of go down. And this station number six was the classic rock station, Rock 103. And number six is often just awful. Every once in a while, they\u0027ll have a good Led Zeppelin song on, and that\u0027s why I have it set."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"So I hit it, and there\u0027s that song, which I don\u0027t know the name of, but it\u0027s that one that goes, \"ooh, child, things are going to get easier.\" And I think to myself, that\u0027s certainly an expansive definition of classic rock. So then I think, wow, this is great. And then another song comes on. And it\u0027s \"Disco Inferno,\" or something like that."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And I think now, something must be wrong. So I look and I think, the first thing is that somebody\u0027s been messing with my dials. Like somebody got into my car and rearranged my radio stations. But then I look at the numbers. The numbers are the same."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And then I hear this announcement that comes on. And it\u0027s like, \"You\u0027ve found the new 1035, Jammin\u0027 Oldies.\" And I think to myself, what the hell is a jammin\u0027 oldie? And you have to keep in mind that the day before, this station had been playing Anthrax and Slayer, and every once in a while, like I said, a Led Zeppelin song, but basically heavy metal gearhead music. And now all of a sudden, there\u0027s just no mention being made of it. And it\u0027s just like the old station was disappeared."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"You\u0027ve found the new 1035.

And they didn\u0027t mention it on the weekend, when I had been listening before. There was no mention of it. They were doing their concert promotions and having people call up to get Anthrax tickets or whatever. Nothing had been said."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And so obviously, everybody who has been tuning in before is expecting the classic rock. But they don\u0027t want to seem like they\u0027re a new station. They don\u0027t want to seem like the new kid on the block."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"So what they do, is they do what everybody does on the first day. They pretend like it\u0027s not the first day. They want to establish this illusion that they\u0027ve been around forever, so they have these little promo spots that come on, these little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] where they have people they\u0027ve interviewed-- like, man on the street interviews-- where people are talking about how great jammin\u0027 oldies are, and how wonderful it is to have this station that plays jammin\u0027 oldies which has been on the radio for three hours."},{"speakerName":"Announcer 2","text":"Everybody\u0027s talking about the new station that plays Chicago\u0027s jammin\u0027 oldies."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"You know, when you hear those songs, it brings you back, like you\u0027re right there."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"You know?

No."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And that also comes through. I mean, if you hear the spots, it\u0027s like this sort of desperately-- It\u0027s like they\u0027re trying too hard. And it\u0027s just exactly what happens when you\u0027re trying to fit in too hard, and you\u0027re pretending like you\u0027ve around forever, and you know the ropes, and it just falls flat. And these spots just fall flat."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"The one that I love is where they have, like, \"This is the station that plays jammin\u0027 oldies.\" And then they cut to this voice of somebody going, \"jammin\u0027 oldies!\""},{"speakerName":"Announcer 1","text":"Now here comes more of Chicago\u0027s jammin\u0027 oldies."},{"speakerName":"Excited Woman","text":"Jammin\u0027 oldies!"},{"speakerName":"Announcer 1","text":"On the new 103--"},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"I don\u0027t quite understand what it is that is just so ridiculous about that particular \"jammin\u0027 oldies.\" But it\u0027s just like it\u0027s so earnest and so wrong. It\u0027s just not right. It\u0027s just not what somebody would say if they were actually excited about jammin\u0027 oldies. They would never-- I can\u0027t imagine a situation in which somebody would authentically be shouting \"jammin\u0027 oldies! Jammin\u0027 oldies!\" A jammin\u0027 oldies pep rally? I can\u0027t imagine where it would be happening."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"I mean, I have nothing in common with the station formerly known as Rock 103. And yet, all the behaviors that they are exhibiting on their first day are behaviors that I would exhibit on my first day anywhere.

They\u0027re pretending to have experienced things that they have, in fact, not experienced.

There was suddenly an opening."},{"speakerName":"Jack Hitt","text":"So I told her about this, and she-- the idea of moving on to the next stage in her life, the first time she had ever had that option, was so exciting. She literally jumped out of her chair and ran circles around this cafeteria.

And that would require some getting used to. You say that to a three year old, and you think they understand what you\u0027re saying, but of course they don\u0027t.

They set out for school."},{"speakerName":"Jack Hitt","text":"On the morning of her first day, this was Columbus setting off into the Atlantic, right?

But we don\u0027t know those rules and customs just yet. It is a very particular time. And all the kids at the school that Tarpeley was entering, they already knew each other from the year before. She was the newcomer."},{"speakerName":"Jack Hitt","text":"I can\u0027t remember if it was the first day or the second day. But I remember the gut-wrenching moment was when I came to pick her up one day and we were walking home. And she started to cry, and said that she wanted to go back to her other school. And the reason was that one of the little children there had told her that she couldn\u0027t play with them. That there was this little group, and my daughter wasn\u0027t invited to play with them, because they didn\u0027t know her, and that she should stay away from them.

When he was a freshman at a military boarding school when he was a kid, the freshmen were called \"rats.\" This is common. Upperclassmen would wake them up in the middle of the night, tell them to go warm the toilet seats for them. Jack\u0027s wife is a medical student. And you know residents, they work 40 hours without a break, taking the worst cases, doing the worst work, delirious from sleep deprivation. you have to do all that before the older doctors welcome you into the club, give you the keys to their Mercedes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The whole thing reminds me of the way gangs work here in Chicago. Joining a gang here in Chicago, or really a lot of places around the country, means that you get jumped in. Your future gang brothers or sisters take you into an alley and beat the hell out of you."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"There is just something primal and intimate about the entire thing, as if the existence of the first day, the simple presence of an outsider who wants to be an insider, is so profound, so disturbing to any group, that they have to crush you, prove you harmless, before they welcome you into the family. This is the disturbing aura that surrounds the first day."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, First Day, the story of outsiders who show up wanting to be insiders, and what it takes to make the jump."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Lost at Sea. How cussing can get you through moments when reason fails. The story of a lowly dishwasher who gets a job on an oil rig off the Louisiana coast. Act Two, Squirrel Cop. The story of a rookie cop that is so, so pleasurable that all week around the office, here at the radio station, we have been cracking each other up simply by walking up to each other and saying the words, \"Squirrel cop.\" Act Three, Bad Sex with Bud Kemp.

The story of an entire corporation having its first day, and how it makes all the mistakes that any of us would make on our first day on the job. Stay with us. You will not be disappointed."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Lost at Sea. Well, regular listeners to our show may remember Dishwasher Pete. He is an actual dishwasher who, for over eight years, has been pursuing his quest to wash dishes in every state of the union. He is up to 33 states. To score at Louisiana, he thought that he would try to get a job on an oil rig out in the Gulf of Mexico, but there was one problem. It would mean breaking what Pete calls the fundamental rule."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Basically, the rule is this. Never work at a job where I can\u0027t quit and leave the moment the notion struck me. For 10 years, ever since I had established the fundamental rule, I had never broken it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"He wanted to try, though. If you could handle two weeks on an oil rig, maybe-- just maybe-- he could dare to head off to a bigger dream of his, to wash dishes on a fishing boat for months off the coast of Alaska. With that in mind, he set off to test the fundamental rule."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"[UNINTELLIGIBLE] the company that supplied galley hands for oil rigs in a small town outside New Orleans. I filled out a bunch of paperwork and sat around with a half dozen other applicants. When my name was finally called, I walked down a hall to where a guy greeted me."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Too stunned to catch his name, I could only stare at him and think, \"My god, it\u0027s Bill Clinton.\" He was an absolute dead ringer for Bill Clinton. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off him as he led me into his office. The resemblance was remarkable. He had the same puffy cheeks, the same dimpled chin, and the same salt and pepper hair and haircut. He even had that familiar Clinton smirk, only this guy\u0027s smirk seemed to say, I know you think I look like Clinton, and you\u0027re dying to ask me about it."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"The Clinton clone said, I had left a couple things blank on my application, such as the make and license plate number of my car. \"I don\u0027t have a car,\" I said."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"You don\u0027t? Why not?\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Um, I guess I just don\u0027t need one.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Well, you need one for this job. In fact, owning a car is the most important qualification for being a galley hand.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"I have to own a car to wash dishes on an oil rig?\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"That\u0027s right. When you\u0027re on call, and the dispatcher calls and tells you to be down at the coast in three hours, you have to be there. We can\u0027t wait for you to find a car to borrow or to find someone to drive you.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Oh, well, in that case, I do own a car.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Great. What kind?\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"It\u0027s a station wagon.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"And what\u0027s the license plate number?\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"I\u0027m not sure.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"You don\u0027t know your own license plate number?\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Well, I\u0027d have to go outside and check on it.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"You go do that, then.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I stepped outside and wrote down the license plate number of a car that I hoped wasn\u0027t his, and then went back in and gave it to him. Minutes later, I was issued a hard hat, safety glasses, and two work shirts. I was now officially on call."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I spent the rest of the afternoon walking back to the city, grasping at my last fleeting moments of freedom. I was on the verge of breaking the fundamental rule, and could foresee only disaster. To make my fretting worse, the next day a friend of a friend, who claimed to be familiar with life on the oil rigs, told me I could expect to be hazed. As if overcoming my occupational claustrophobia wasn\u0027t enough, I was going to have to put up with idiots hazing me, as well."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Two days later, I was flown to an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The helicopter approached the center of three connected platforms and landed on the roof of its uppermost structure. I asked the pilot, \"Where would I find the galley?\" \"Go down those stairs, and someone will show you,\" he said. I took off my headset, put on my hardhat and safety glasses, grabbed my bag, and hopped out. I held the door open, reluctant to break my link to the outside world. \"So where did you say the galley was?\" I shouted over the roar of the whirling blades. \"Just go down those stairs,\" the pilot shouted back. \"Shut the door.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I shut the door and ran across the roof. As I dashed down the stairs, the helicopter revved up. I paused momentarily, but resisted the temptation to run back up to the roof. The fundamental rule had been broken. There was nothing left to do but face the consequences."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Down the stairs, I popped my head through an open door and asked a guy which way to the galley. \"Go this way and that,\" he said. \"Down these stairs and those. Can\u0027t miss it.\" I followed his directions and found myself out in the middle of the platform, surrounded by cargo containers and pipes and assorted industrial junk."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"You passed it. The door is back that way.\" A guy in a tiny window of one of the cargo containers pointed back the way I came. I looked, but didn\u0027t find any doors. Apparently, a little fun was already being had at the new guy\u0027s expense. Were they going to lead me all over the damn rig searching for the galley? I cursed myself for letting the helicopter leave without me."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Then I noticed a piece of cardboard that had scrawled handwriting written on it. It read, \"Keep out. This means you. Wet floor. Signed, Redneck.\" The sign hung from what I realized was a door handle. I tugged and pulled and turned the handle every which way, but couldn\u0027t get the damn door to budge. I was so green, I couldn\u0027t even unlock a simple latch."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I was helpless until, almost magically, the door opened from the inside. In front of me stood the guy I had seen through the window. \"[BLEEP], son,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t just stand there playing with yourself. Come on in.\" He introduced himself as Redneck, the galley steward. My boss."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I stepped inside and asked him where the galley was. \"Man, you\u0027re in the mother[BLEEP] galley,\" he scoffed. Looking around, I was pretty sure he had to be putting me on. Even though I could see a small kitchen, the whole space was barely bigger than the kitchen and dining room of a house."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Where does everybody eat, then?\" I asked."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"\"Right [BLEEP] there,\" Redneck said, kicking one of the two benches that faced the counter along one wall. Obviously, 100 employees couldn\u0027t fit on those two benches, but since he seemed to think I was gullible, I played along. \"Yeah, OK,\" I said."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"The rig clerk, acting as the official welcoming committee, arrived right behind me. He instructed me what to do in case of an emergency. \"If there\u0027s an explosion,\" he said, \"run to whatever platform isn\u0027t burning.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Redneck, as I would later learn he insisted on being called, introduced me to Cuz, the other galley hand, who was mopping the kitchen. My job instructions from Redneck were simple. \"As long as you keep them [BLEEP] dishes clean, there ain\u0027t a mother[BLEEP] on this rig who\u0027d give you [BLEEP].\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"After a brief tour of the small kitchen, Redneck showed me to my station. I stepped up to the sinks and assumed by preferred dishwashing stance. Looking straight ahead, I saw heaven. Right there above the sinks, perfectly at eye level, was a porthole. I immediately knew that this little window to the world would play a huge role in helping me survive for two weeks without quitting. I looked out at the endless expanse of the Gulf of Mexico. There wasn\u0027t much to look at-- a whole lot of sea, a whole lot of sky, and dozens of rigs off in the distance-- but already, I felt at ease."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"My gaze was broken by Redneck repeatedly saying, \"Hey, pardner. Hey, pardner!\" I didn\u0027t initially recognize my new nickname. \"Hey, pardner,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t [BLEEP] cuss much, do you?\" \"No,\" I answered. \"Not really.\" \"Well [BLEEP],\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to mother[BLEEP] cuss for the both of us, then.\" And he did. Then it was time for lunch."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Redneck explained that, despite the fact that the rig was comprised of three connected platforms, the crew was actually pretty small. Altogether, there were about 30 people to be fed. Their mealtimes were staggered. So there were never more than five or six guys in the galley at any given time. This slow but steady pace applied to the dishes as well. There were always dishes for me to wash, but never any rush to get them done."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Several times during lunch, crew hands walked up to me in the kitchen with big grins on their faces and asked, \"How\u0027s it going, bro?\" \"OK,\" I\u0027d shrug. They waited. For what, I had no idea. They waited, and then they grew irritated with me and stomped out of the kitchen. One guy said, \"What\u0027s this quiet-ass mother[BLEEP]\u0027s problem, Redneck?\" \"He likes looking out that [BLEEP] window. What can I say?\" I didn\u0027t understand. I washed the dishes, I looked out the window, I minded my own business, just as Redneck had instructed. Why would anyone have a problem with that?"},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"After a few more of these encounters over the next couple of days, I finally realized what was going on. The rig hands, after working a gritty shift of roustabouting and roughnecking, expected to be greeted in the galley with some witty remark or joke, maybe even a song or dance. They expected the galley hand to provide some comic relief, like a court jester. What they got instead was me washing dishes and staring out at the sea."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Well, too bad. I wasn\u0027t there to entertain anyone. If I wanted a job shucking and jiving for diners, I would have become a waiter."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Redneck was never at ease. He raced back and forth across the tiny kitchen when he cooked, a constant stream of chatter flowing from his lips. He was a fun and funny guy, but he had a nervous edge that was attributed by all, including himself, to the seven years he spent as a CIA mercenary in southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. I never saw Redneck sit down for more than 30 seconds before he jumped up again and resumed his frantic pacing."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"He grew especially nervous when he and I were alone in the galley, and I stood staring out my porthole. \"Goddamn, pardner! Say [BLEEP] something!\" If I had nothing to say, usually I just cursed, since he got a kick out of that. \"[BLEEP] it,\" I\u0027d say. \"You got that right, pardner,\" he\u0027d laugh. \"[BLEEP] it.\" Then, after further contemplation, he\u0027d add, \"Mother[BLEEP] it.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Not an hour passed without Redneck raising one of his favorite topics for discussion, sex with farm animals. Redneck was raised on a farm in Arkansas, and was quite knowledgeable about having sex with farm animals, and wasn\u0027t stingy with this information. He was also always prepared to discuss his other favorite topic whenever Cuz was around, the various ways to kill a man. Between Redneck\u0027s experiences in southeast Asia and Cuz\u0027s experiences in street gangs and prison, they had plenty of stories to share and information to exchange. Sometimes when I broke from my daydreaming at the window, I found it difficult to decipher exactly which topic Redneck was presently discussing. \"You just sneak up behind them and get your arms around his [BLEEP] neck like that, and that [BLEEP] is all yours.\""},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"Every day, the Gulf went through a metamorphosis. For hours on end, I watched the endless expanse of water slosh up and down, back and forth, as the parade of fish, porpoises, seaweed, stingrays, driftwood, and jellyfish swam and floated past. Seabirds soared by on a fixed course to some unseen destination beyond the horizon."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I eyed the dozens of other oil rigs that stood 5, 10, 20 miles across the watery plain. Some appeared no bigger than a blip on the horizon. I wondered a lot about the galley hands on those rigs who were staring back at the blip that was our rig."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"The more I stared out at the Gulf, the more transfixed I became by the water. There was water as far as I could see, in all directions. I was surrounded by it. I was trapped by it. My hands soaked in it. I drank it constantly. The more I stared at the water, the less I understood it."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"The hazing I had feared as a greenhorn never materialized. As each day passed, I felt more confident I could last the full two weeks without quitting. The countdown to departure ticked away rapidly. Three days and a wakeup, two days and a wakeup, one day and a wakeup. Finally there was nothing left but a wakeup. No more shifts to work, no more dishes to wash. Just had to wake up and jump on the helicopter."},{"speakerName":"Dishwasher Pete","text":"I thought back to the day I landed on the rig. At the end of my first shift, Cookie, the night cook, had asked me, \"This your first day on a rig?\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Well, the first day is the worst, and all the rest are just the same.\""},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Dishwasher Pete\u0027s story was first published in the zine he writes and publishes, Dishwasher."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC - \"WORKING FOR THE MAN\" BY RAY ORBISON]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Two, Squirrel Cop."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The first day, among other things, means human error. It means mistakes. It means mishap. It means fiasco. That is true on a job or anywhere else that the first day occurs. You don\u0027t know the ropes. What else could happen? We have this story from a police officer, now a veteran of the force, in a suburban community on the East Coast."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"There was nothing, nothing going on. Saturday night in this village. Really quiet. Super cold. And this call came over for unknown animal in a house. And it was on my post. It was about five minutes away."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So myself and another car were assigned the call. And we show up there. And luckily for me, it was another guy who was pretty new. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on. The nylon coat, the vest, the belt, the whole nine yards."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And the door opens, and the guy who is behind the door, he\u0027s about 30. I was 23 at the time. He\u0027s about 30. He looks like a broker, a lawyer. Just really well put together. A nice guy wearing glasses. He\u0027s wearing these silk pajamas with a monogram. Got my attention. And he\u0027s going, listen, I\u0027m really sorry to bother you. Normally I\u0027d handle this sort of stuff on my own. But my wife really insisted I call."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And so we ask him what the problem is. He says, well, we were having kind of a romantic evening down in the living room, and we heard this scratching upstairs. So I ran upstairs to see what it was. And it turns out it\u0027s coming from the attic. There\u0027s something up there, and it\u0027s just running around, knocking a few small things over. I can\u0027t tell what it is. It could be a squirrel or raccoon. I really don\u0027t know."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the other cop that I was with said, well, you know, we really don\u0027t handle that. It\u0027s not so much a police function. But we do have numbers of these private contractors who will come in and they\u0027ll put a humane trap down, and they\u0027ll remove the animal for you. It\u0027s really not such a big deal. But it\u0027s really not our thing."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So right as he was in the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook, the guy swings the door back, and there is his wife, who was just beautiful. She was beautiful. She was probably about 26 or 27, but just really beautiful. Perfect skin, long blond hair, great teeth, brilliant blue eyes, a really nice smile. Just, like, beautiful and friendly. You know? If she had said, eat this broken glass, I just would have said, OK, broken glass it is. It\u0027s fine."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"But she seemed really nice. So I was going to be, like, Galahad. So I just threw my arm back into this guy\u0027s chest, into my partner\u0027s chest. And I said, Mark, we can handle this. It\u0027ll be OK."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And she was just, oh, thank you so much. And she was really sweet. And I was, like, struck dead. So we walk inside. And she goes, I\u0027m going to throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs. We follow the man of the house upstairs. And we\u0027re underneath one of those trapdoors that goes into the attic with the staircase that folds out."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And we do hear an animal upstairs scratching away, just kind of scuttling around the floor. And there\u0027s definitely something up there. And it\u0027s making pretty good speed going from one end of the roof to the other. So I reached up, and I took the trapdoor down. We unfolded the ladder."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Now I have this big, heavy flashlight, your cop flashlight. The 4 D-cells, the metal case, the whole thing. I shine it up through the hole in there. And it\u0027s pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the latter. Now, the guy who owned the house is standing almost directly underneath me, just to the side of the latter, looking straight up at me. And my partner\u0027s at the base of the latter, right behind me."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So just before I stuck my head through this black hole, I just kind of pause. I crunch my body up underneath, because I\u0027m realizing, gee, I don\u0027t know where this thing is. The second we pulled down the trap door, all noise upstairs just ceased. So I was kind of nervous. And I was like, well, you know, I look like an idiot, just crouched up here on the top of the ladder. So I took the flashlight, and I just popped my head up, turned the light on again."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel, at eye level with me, kind of reared back on its legs. And I swear, from where I was standing, it looked like Godzilla. It just scared the heck out of me. I thought, it\u0027s a squirrel. It\u0027s going to be hiding somewhere. It\u0027s going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me. And it really startled me. So I kind of went, \"ah!\" And jumped back."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And the flashlight slips out of my hands-- and it\u0027s heavy-- and it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who\u0027s looking straight up at me. And I don\u0027t think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose-- his hands up to his face, blood just started pouring out between his hands."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is the homeowner?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards, directly onto my partner, and I just pancake him. We\u0027re both our backs. He\u0027s on his back. I\u0027m on his stomach, on my back, scuttling around like a beetle, trying to get up in this really narrow hallway. It\u0027s a mess."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"The squirrel, while we\u0027re floundering around in the hallway, jumps down the stairs-- boink, boink, boink-- lands on me, and takes off down the stairs."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How undignified."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"It was terrible. It was terrible. So we\u0027re wondering, gee, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, you hear her scream. So my partner goes, well, we found the squirrel. It\u0027s wherever she is."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So we go running downstairs. And the squirrel had come into the living room, where they had been having their romantic evening. They had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around one corner of the couch next to the fire, and they had champagne flutes out. Nice house. Really nice. I mean, it just smelled brand new. New carpeting, new rugs, new paint. They hadn\u0027t been there for that long."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the squirrel, when it bolted down the staircase, took off into the living room and ran underneath the couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is bleeding all over the place, on his carpets. His wife looks and says, what have you done to my husband? I start going, oh, it was an accident-- and then I just stop in mid-sentence. What\u0027s the point? We\u0027ve only been there about two minutes."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the squirrel is underneath the couch. And my partner is going, let\u0027s get out of here. This is just-- it\u0027s not going well. So I am not beaten yet. I always have another idea."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So the squirrel is under this couch, which in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don\u0027t we move the furniture away from one of the corners? And we\u0027ll put the catch in the corner. And the squirrel will probably move along with the couch, because it\u0027s the only cover available to it. And once we get into the corner, we\u0027ll only have two open sides of the couch to worry about. So we did that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That is so tactical."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Yes. Yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instant. But you know."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"I asked her for a box. And she says, sure, we\u0027ve got boxes. We just moved in. We have nothing but boxes. She runs out to the garage. And she comes back with a box. And the box is long enough. And it fits across the entire short side of the couch, where the armrests would be. So I start sweeping underneath the couch with my nightstick, trying to move the squirrel toward the box. Figuring we\u0027ll capture it and just get rid of it. And we\u0027ll be out of here. And there\u0027ll be no more mayhem."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So it\u0027s actually working very well. And the squirrel\u0027s moving down along. You can hear it. It\u0027s chittering. And I\u0027m trying not to hurt it. I\u0027m nervous about the thing. It might bite me. I don\u0027t want to hurt it, really. It\u0027s just an animal."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"So I\u0027m moving it along. And everything\u0027s going very well. And then with about eight inches to go, I took one more swipe, and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch. It was lined with tassels. I couldn\u0027t really see under the couch. It bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. The fireplace was directly head of it, and it ran into the fire, and caught on fire, and ran directly back out, and directly back under the couch."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Is it on fire?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"It was on fire. Yeah. The tail, the bushy fur, the whole bit. I mean, it wasn\u0027t, like, flaming or anything. But it was smoking. And there was a little bit of fire coming off the tail. So it runs back under the couch. And the couch catches on fire in seconds. I mean, in seconds. It must have had dust under there or something else. But it just caught on fire immediately."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And my partner and I just don\u0027t even talk. We just grab the couch, heave it upside down. And now there\u0027s plenty of oxygen for the fire to really get going. And it starts up. And we\u0027re patting it out. And it\u0027s sort of getting away from us. So we grab the only thing that\u0027s really available. And those are these really nice silk pillows. And we have one in each hand, the both of us. And we\u0027re just windmilling away at this fire on the couch. And we put it out."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"But it\u0027s smoking terribly. And it was just a disaster. The couch is upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filling with smoke from the couch. The squirrel, when it went under the couch, in its death throes, just latched on to the bottom of the couch. It\u0027s like this smoking piece of gristle underneath the couch, latched on there with its claws. And we\u0027re pounding, smearing it all over the place. And the smoke alarms are firing away. The guy is standing with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose, which is still bleeding. His pajamas are a mess. They\u0027re covered with blood, the front of them."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And we finally get the fire out. And we\u0027re both completely red. Sweating, because we\u0027re dressed for like zero degree weather, and it\u0027s hot there, by the fire. We\u0027re mortified. The house is full of smoke."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"The wife just looks around and just starts to cry. She goes, what have you done? What have you done to my house? You can see her just clicking things off on the fingers. OK. The dead squirrel, ruined pillows, need a new couch, the walls are covered with soot, the fire alarms are going off, my husband\u0027s disfigured. And then she really kind of just lost it."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And he was just looking at us and shaking his head, like he couldn\u0027t believe that these two idiots showed up and did this to his house over nothing, really. And he just goes, you know, you really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I can\u0027t point to any one thing that you did that I have a reason to get angry about. You really haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I mean, we did call you. But I just, I can\u0027t thank you for this. They call for a squirrel. They end up with $3,000, $4,000 worth of damage and a broken nose. And this is all within about five minutes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Could that have happened to you now, 13 years later?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"There\u0027s always a new mistake to be made. I don\u0027t think I would make that particular mistake. I mean, you make plenty of mistakes. That\u0027s just part of that job. You just try not to make the same one twice. But there\u0027s such variety that you\u0027re going to make hundreds, you\u0027re going to make thousands of mistakes, until you really get a handle on what you\u0027re doing."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That\u0027s interesting. That is a very particular thing about a new job. Is that in order to learn the job, you literally have to make the mistakes. There\u0027s no way around it."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Right. And with police work, they afford you plenty of space to make mistakes. But there are things that just aren\u0027t your responsibility-- if you get involved in things that aren\u0027t your responsibility, or that you\u0027re really not equipped to handle, or that you don\u0027t have a specific plan-- a plan that\u0027s thought through to a conclusion-- you probably should reevaluate what you\u0027re doing."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah, now that you mentioned that, that\u0027s right. You walked into the house, thinking, OK. We\u0027ll get this squirrel. Like, how were you going to get the squirrel? What was the best case scenario?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"That\u0027s a great question. I guess I was thinking that I would go up there in the attic, and find this cowering squirrel, and somehow kind of lure it into some kind of trap, and then walk out with it and be like a hero. But as it turned out, it was a Pyrrhic victory for the squirrel, but the squirrel definitely won. The squirrel really kicked our ass."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That is not what you want to be saying at the end of the day."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"No, no. It took me a long time to even tell people about it, you know? I was so new. I didn\u0027t want to know what a bonehead I was when I first came onto the job."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Describe what you thought police work was going to be the day that you entered the academy."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"What I thought it would be was one adventure after another, kind of. And that sounds childish. But that\u0027s sort of what I did envision. And then one of the very first days I was on, I had the school crossing where I used to go to school. So at 23, I was crossing these kids where I had went to grammar school and I went to high school. Freezing cold. And I knew just about every third or fourth car that went by. And everyone\u0027s beeping and honking. And there was some slush on the ground."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And my mother drove by. And she stopped in the middle of the intersection. And she goes, what are you doing out here without a hat on?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Loud enough for others to hear?"},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"Not at all. Not at all."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Thank goodness for that."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"You know, she just, what are you doing out here without a hat on? Mom, I have the hat I\u0027m supposed to wear. She\u0027s like, but it doesn\u0027t cover your ears. It\u0027s freezing out here."},{"speakerName":"Cop","text":"And that\u0027s when I started to realize, hey, this isn\u0027t all about car chases and everything else. It\u0027s just like living at home."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Our interviewee has two years to retirement.

We have this story from Sandra Tsing Loh in Los Angeles."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"Bud Kemp was a guy I\u0027d known for eight years, first in college, then at the pharmaceutical corporation where I worked. I had always thought of Bud as a nice guy, and not unattractive. Not exactly attractive, either. I mean, he had good features-- tall, wavy brown hair, lanky build-- but there always seemed to be this kind of beaten quality to Bud-- in his sad smile, stooped shoulders, pear shape-- as though he were being flogged by life. Sexually, Bud Kemp was an inert object."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"That perception changed dramatically one night early in the summer of my 31st year. Although not really intimate, Bud and I were in the habit of going to the movies every Thursday night. This movie night tradition had been started by a little dorm group in college, although of course as members drifted towards 30, pairing up or marrying people from the outside, they\u0027d left Bud, I, and movie night behind."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"No doubt, Bud had also tried to leave Bud, I, and movie night behind. I tried myself. But it was difficult. I mean, I\u0027ve never been the sort of woman who walks into a room in a Lycra mini dress, hair moussed to staggering proportion, and the men just drop dead all around. No. My charms are more subtle. I\u0027m the kind of girl guys fall back on. Tireless listener. Lender of money. Provider of Xanax. Ride to LAX. And so, as though held together by gravity, eight years later, Bud and I would still find ourselves sitting together in the darkened movie theater, clutching separate containers of popcorn, not saying a word. Hardly a date, I\u0027d think."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"But one night during the opening credits, I looked over at Bud. And for the first time I realized what a sharp profile he had. What relatively clear skin. And his hands clasped together over one big knee. They were nice, too. Suddenly a phrase popped into my mind. \"The strong, capable hands of Bud Kemp.\" Strong. Capable. Silent. Could this Bud Kemp be used for sex?"},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"So things are getting hot, if in kind of a lukewarm way. The coming of our pharmaceutical corporation\u0027s summer softball league in Torrance makes them even hotter. Oh yeah. Once a year, summer softball provides we who labor in sector D7 with an excuse to just go wild. Wear funny raccoon hats with our team names on them, yell \"whoo, whoo\" for no reason at all."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"My team, the Fly Balls, is composed mostly of the four Fs of the softball universe.

This is a little known fact about Bud Kemp. He did play a year of junior varsity basketball in college. So what if it was at a small science school with a 57-game losing streak? So what if Bud Kemp was thrown onto the court mainly for use as a human shield?"},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"The point is, in sector D7, Bud Kemp is our sports stud. And a damned good-looking one, too. Hair faintly blonded under the sun, skin lightly tanned, and are those new glasses? God, yes. Instead of sad clown sideways teardrops, these are cool wire rims. Sting wears wire rims."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"Bud steps up to the mound, pulls off his t-shirt, and his naked torso is-- OK. 33 and holding, is the triumphal message here. Although he is so Schwarzenegger, there are definite suggestions of biceps and pecs. More than suggestions. Announcements, even. Not very loud announcements, but the point is, situps are being completed, racquetball played, body parts attended to, secretly anointed, perhaps. Is it just my third fuzzy navel talking, or is Bud Kemp ready for sex?"},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"We\u0027re at Pizza Hut now, talking and laughing.

Laugh and kick out. Laugh and kick out. But there is no laughter here. Only worry and sweat. How I long for Pizza Hut with its pepperoni-laced orgy-like ambiance. Sex between two people can be such a lonely thing."},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"Grimly pushing on, I tear my t-shirt off, revealing my sexy black bra, his cue to just go wild. But Bud Kemp is rubbing his eyes with both hands. Still I wait, with accusing breasts. Still Bud rubs, making that kind of faint humming sound. [HUMMING]"},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"And I realize that Bud Kemp can not bring himself to face my breasts in all their terrible candor. They blaze in the darkness like headlights, illuminating the falseness of all of those movie nights. Eventually, Bud stops running and just lies there with both hands cupped over his eyes, as though expecting to be flogged. His nostrils quiver. Is that a snore?"},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"My idea is that we will never speak of the incident again, see each other, or even continue to live in the same state. But no. The bouquet that arrived the next morning is the ugliest I have ever seen. It is a chaos of white baby\u0027s breath, purple lupin, pink carnations, yellow daisies, all stabbing against each other in frantic counterpoint. Even worse is the card, which reads, \"I saw these flowers and thought of you. Love, Bud.\""},{"speakerName":"Sandra Tsing Loh","text":"Love, Bud. One thing is for sure. He is not my lovebud, and this is not me at age 31, a frantic bouquet slowly wilting."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Sandra Tsing Loh\u0027s story \"Bad Sex with Bud Kemp\" is not collected in her books Aliens in America, A Year in Van Nuys, or any of her fine books. She has been happily married for years to a man who is not in any way, any way, Bud Kemp. They live in Los Angeles."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC - \"THE FIRST TIME\" BY EYDIE GORME]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Four, When Businesses Act Like People."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"We have this case study from Alex Blumberg, a radio listener-- a radio listener like you, a radio listener like me-- here in Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"This is a story about a first day that\u0027s in denial that it\u0027s a first day. The story starts when I was in my car. And I just realized that I have my preset station buttons arranged in order of preference. One, two, three, four, five, six. And so I sort of go down. And this station number six was the classic rock station, Rock 103. And number six is often just awful. Every once in a while, they\u0027ll have a good Led Zeppelin song on, and that\u0027s why I have it set."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"So I hit it, and there\u0027s that song, which I don\u0027t know the name of, but it\u0027s that one that goes, \"ooh, child, things are going to get easier.\" And I think to myself, that\u0027s certainly an expansive definition of classic rock. So then I think, wow, this is great. And then another song comes on. And it\u0027s \"Disco Inferno,\" or something like that."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And I think now, something must be wrong. So I look and I think, the first thing is that somebody\u0027s been messing with my dials. Like somebody got into my car and rearranged my radio stations. But then I look at the numbers. The numbers are the same."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And then I hear this announcement that comes on. And it\u0027s like, \"You\u0027ve found the new 1035, Jammin\u0027 Oldies.\" And I think to myself, what the hell is a jammin\u0027 oldie? And you have to keep in mind that the day before, this station had been playing Anthrax and Slayer, and every once in a while, like I said, a Led Zeppelin song, but basically heavy metal gearhead music. And now all of a sudden, there\u0027s just no mention being made of it. And it\u0027s just like the old station was disappeared."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"You\u0027ve found the new 1035. Chicago\u0027s new station for jammin\u0027 oldies. We don\u0027t play moldy oldies, and we don\u0027t play doo-wop--"},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"Now what has happened is that this station had a format change over the weekend, basically. And they didn\u0027t mention it on the weekend, when I had been listening before. There was no mention of it. They were doing their concert promotions and having people call up to get Anthrax tickets or whatever. Nothing had been said."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And so obviously, everybody who has been tuning in before is expecting the classic rock. But they don\u0027t want to seem like they\u0027re a new station. They don\u0027t want to seem like the new kid on the block."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"So what they do, is they do what everybody does on the first day. They pretend like it\u0027s not the first day. They want to establish this illusion that they\u0027ve been around forever, so they have these little promo spots that come on, these little [UNINTELLIGIBLE] where they have people they\u0027ve interviewed-- like, man on the street interviews-- where people are talking about how great jammin\u0027 oldies are, and how wonderful it is to have this station that plays jammin\u0027 oldies which has been on the radio for three hours."},{"speakerName":"Announcer 2","text":"Everybody\u0027s talking about the new station that plays Chicago\u0027s jammin\u0027 oldies."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"You know, when you hear those songs, it brings you back, like you\u0027re right there."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"You know? Like, what did they do? They just start broadcasting, and immediately send a squad of people out to find people who are accidentally tuned in? No."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"And that also comes through. I mean, if you hear the spots, it\u0027s like this sort of desperately-- It\u0027s like they\u0027re trying too hard. And it\u0027s just exactly what happens when you\u0027re trying to fit in too hard, and you\u0027re pretending like you\u0027ve around forever, and you know the ropes, and it just falls flat. And these spots just fall flat."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"The one that I love is where they have, like, \"This is the station that plays jammin\u0027 oldies.\" And then they cut to this voice of somebody going, \"jammin\u0027 oldies!\""},{"speakerName":"Announcer 1","text":"Now here comes more of Chicago\u0027s jammin\u0027 oldies."},{"speakerName":"Excited Woman","text":"Jammin\u0027 oldies!"},{"speakerName":"Announcer 1","text":"On the new 103--"},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"I don\u0027t quite understand what it is that is just so ridiculous about that particular \"jammin\u0027 oldies.\" But it\u0027s just like it\u0027s so earnest and so wrong. It\u0027s just not right. It\u0027s just not what somebody would say if they were actually excited about jammin\u0027 oldies. They would never-- I can\u0027t imagine a situation in which somebody would authentically be shouting \"jammin\u0027 oldies! Jammin\u0027 oldies!\" A jammin\u0027 oldies pep rally? I can\u0027t imagine where it would be happening."},{"speakerName":"Alex Blumberg","text":"I mean, I have nothing in common with the station formerly known as Rock 103. And yet, all the behaviors that they are exhibiting on their first day are behaviors that I would exhibit on my first day anywhere. Like they are trying to fit in, they\u0027re expressing sort of this anxious enthusiasm, the false bravado. They\u0027re pretending to have experienced things that they have, in fact, not experienced. And they\u0027re failing miserably, just as I would fail miserably, and have, on many occasions, on my first day."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Alex Blumberg."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, it\u0027s This American Life, the radio program that can not resist a dare.
