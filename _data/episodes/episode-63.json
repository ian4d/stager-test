I was ready to start hitting people and just run. You know just elbow him here, punch him here, and make so I can get out. It\u0027s like my mind was ready, boom, take control. Just start fighting. But I just like, wait a minute. No, I\u0027m not going to do that. God has changed me. I\u0027m a new creation like it says in the bible.

And soon I hope to see you in our church praise the lord together. So he was like, man. So he got mad, real mad. He just said, forget you, man.

In other words, he\u0027s down for his. He\u0027s willing to live and die for what he believes in. Just like when you\u0027re willing to live and die for gang bang. Like me, I was a Latin King. You know what I\u0027m saying? You got to live and die for that crown, right? And that\u0027s what he was dying for. He was dying for God. You know, our lord. He\u0027s there, he\u0027s been done. He\u0027s standing up firm. He\u0027s like, I don\u0027t care about anybody. Just like when you\u0027re on the street. I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m a Latin King. What\u0027s up? You know, I don\u0027t care. What\u0027s up? They beat their chests with their gang sign. You know, what\u0027s up? What\u0027s up? I\u0027m this and this and that.

        "It\u0027s just a question of how much you want to invest yourself in this position, I think. And you pay a price. Your skin is flayed. And that\u0027s the traditional price of a heretic. I\u0027m not trying to be self-dramatizing. It\u0027s the ancient bargain that society makes with these people. And I don\u0027t know if I want to make that investment.",
        "One of my first meetings with a person in this community, a guy I\u0027ve actually become a little friendly with and whom I have a great deal of respect for. And I\u0027m going to call him Patrick because he uses an alias. This is a guy with a very Jimmy Stewart manner and a very casual manner, and he walked me through Fort Marcy Park with great patience, telling me his understanding of what happened on July 20, 1993 when Vince Foster\u0027s body was found. And Patrick\u0027s story is a very logical one. He had hundreds and thousands of facts at his fingertips that I was and am in no position really to challenge. He\u0027s done more research on this than I have.",
        "And at the end of our trip through Fort Marcy Park I said to him, you know, you\u0027ve given me a very logical story, Patrick. I\u0027m willing to believe what you\u0027re saying. You know, it\u0027s very logical. But I might just walk on. What do you think of that?"

        "You know how an idea catches and grabs a hold of you? Maybe you\u0027ve had that. An idea that speaks to your most private imaginings and your deepest hurt feelings, your most secret strange joys. And that idea says, here I am. Change everything because I\u0027m here. I\u0027m perfect. I\u0027m enlightened by sexuality. I\u0027m the new laughing cure for cancer. I am my body and shape and in perfect yoga pose. And these ideas fuel so crucial that the access of your world turns to embrace them.",
        "Eddie\u0027s idea felt like that. And Eddie\u0027s idea was naked and it was obvious. It was without guilt or second thought. Nudity. Nudity now.",
        "Eddie ran naked all the way to the high school. It was his first nude run. His body was flapping like a ship that has come free of its moorings and is now spinning and reckless in the surf.",
        "And at the high school, all his former students, the remedial readers, they were playing manic playground basketball. And Eddie happily ran out on the court. He wanted to dunk a few in the glorious springtime. Dunk a few and then tell the smart guys of his new vision of freedom.",
        "And Eddie yelled in his joy as he hit the court, but his remedial readers weren\u0027t glad to see him. They turned away, laughing, embarrassed by Eddie\u0027s nakedness. And they refused to pass him the ball.",
        "And when Eddie persisted, he leaped at each one of the boys in turn. One of them grabbed the ball and smacked it into Eddie\u0027s face hard. So hard the ball flip stung and bled and Eddie\u0027s eyes filled with tears.",
        "Eddie was lost then. The remedial readers surrounded and hounded him. Oh, they flicked popsicle sticks and clouds of dirt at his exposed penis and his poor back side.",
        "And Eddie slammed the door of his mother\u0027s house. He was crying and he was shaking. And all the remedial readers, they gathered in a pack outside. They were flushed and they talked themselves into a deeper hatred. And one of them grabbed a brick and threw it through Eddie\u0027s mother\u0027s picture window and shattered it. And then there was such a roar of rage and hurt and it just ripped through Eddie\u0027s brain and he grabbed the same brick and he threw it back through the same window. The remaining glass just flying. And then, Eddie jumped through the now open window, falling and gashing his poor hands and his poor feet.",
        "The remedial readers running in all directions. Eddie landing on a lawn of glass. And when he looked up in the sky, written in huge letters of flaming black and red six feet high were the words, \"Why? Don\u0027t ask why. Live.\"",
        "And right then, something deep exploded in Eddie. And his face and his heart, his whole being, flushed with joy.",
        "Shock treatments are serious and they\u0027re undermining. And in Eddie, they led him to a decade of quiet years. Years in which he memorized D.H. Lawrence\u0027s Women in Love from cover to cover. But his body, his naked body, lay in waiting. Impatient for the day when the clothes would come off and his body could go public again.",
        "Eddie Hickock Collins came to Dekalb, Illinois, to work on the railroad. And he grew a huge, red beard that shouted out a fanfare wherever he went.",
        "The Palace was our vegetarian restaurant theater and coffeehouse. It was work and it was home for we young anti-war hippies. It was a workshop for our ideas on how to change the troubled world that we\u0027d been given by our parents. But it was also a refuge. And a magnet, a magnet for people who were obsessed with one idea. And for the odd.",
        "If your father was a mason and now you\u0027d lost your chi and you were doomed to wander the five room universe of The Palace looking for it. If you were hopelessly shy and allergic to the 20th century, and everything that made it tick. If you were a closet arsonist who just needed a place to rest and battle the flames inside you. If you were a bottom pincher who drank too much schnapps and read only 17th century literature, you were welcome at The Palace.",
        "You could bring your dogs and your books and your bare feet. And as long as you didn\u0027t drink Coca-Cola there and at least considered not paying your war taxes, you were welcome. And we would never call the police.",
        "Eddie set up outside The Palace, smiling and silent at first, and he offered his own newsletter, The Beast of Revelation. A passionate, journalistic banner that proclaims the beauty of the human body. The penis is glorious and the vagina is magical. They have to be seen to be believed argued The Beast of Revelations. And after Eddie had figured most of us, the hippie community of The Palace, had a grasp of his basic message, Eddie came in off the sidewalk and he began to talk to us.",
        "He was a public speaker. Could he speak there? Eddie we had a voice and his eyes were wide awake and the title of this first talk was, \"Nudity. Nudity Now.\"",
        "He quoted liberally from the D.H Lawrence\u0027s Women in Love. Lawrence is big. Oh, he\u0027s big. Nudity and orgasm equals freedom. That\u0027s what D.H Lawrence sees. And Lawrence sees me, Eddie. Lawrence agrees with Collins. Nudity, sexuality, they form a square knot of human perfection.",
        "Until the Catholic church and public education get ahold of you. Oh, they\u0027ll twist you and they\u0027ll shame you. And that\u0027s bad. It\u0027s bad. Read Lawrence. He knows. He\u0027s big. Nudity. Nudity now.",
        "We all laughed not knowing why. And at the end of each performance, we followed Eddie out on the sidewalk. Eddie tossing his clothes in all directions before running off, naked into the night. Dekalb was a small place, but by the next week when Eddie spoke there was a real crowd that followed him outside for his personal unveiling.",
        "Edward Hickock Collins blossomed with nudity and attention. And by the fourth week, with the crowd urging him on, the clothes came off on stage and Eddie became the nude public speaker. Speaking out, but speaking nude, he shouted.",
        "And Eddie now began his talks naked and he hung around naked. He could be found at The Palace at all hours naked. Sometimes we politely asked him to dress for an occasion like when someone\u0027s parents came to town and then Eddie would put on this kilt. A kilt he made out of a pair of cut-off jeans slashed free at the legs.",
        "Once my mom came to visit me at The Palace. And I don\u0027t know what mom expected, but what she got was Eddie, naked and relaxed. Eddie reading the New York Times book review section. It made me very nervous when Eddie sat down with my mother, but my mom loved the New York Times book reviews and Eddie must have sensed that because he offered it to her. And the two of them were soon chatting about books they would never have time to read. And quickly, they seemed comfortable together. And that was amazing to me, my mother fully clothed and Eddie not clothed at all.",
        "It was only when Eddie leaned over and asked something so private that my mother never told me what it was. That my mom flushed and stormed away from the table.",
        "And that\u0027s the thing about Eddie. As much as he could win you over, and I liked him, he would always find a way to push things just too far. As if any boundary or border was a foreign thing and it was to be disposed of and gotten through, no matter how you felt about it.",
        "Eddie moved into our house and invited some of The Palace women to sleep with him. And some of them were happy to do it until the most private details of their intimacy started showing up in his speeches, surrounded by big, blinking exclamation points. Look at this.",
        "The police came two months into Eddie\u0027s talks. Eddie was arrested. And soon now, this nude messiah would stand trial. And he felt that, messianic and alone and full of a vision of the world where the pants come down in simultaneous synchronization and whole nations freed from the shackles of clothing, walk freely and hang out in peace.",
        "And Eddie spent the weeks prior to his trial alternating phone calls to Brezhnev and the Kremlin and Jimmy Carter\u0027s White House. Eddie made his calls from the corner laundry mat, urging long distance operators to support his new strategy. International nudity day July 4. Disarm now. The pants come off in simultaneous synchronization for world peace. That\u0027s the hook. If you\u0027re naked, how can you take yourself seriously holding a tank or fondling a nuclear war head? You\u0027d have to set them down.",
        "Someone at the Kremlin actually answered one of Eddie\u0027s calls and Eddie just poured it on over the phone, his whole platform. But at the White House, they just put him on hold and left him there. Eddie hardly noticed. His campaign was heating up.",
        "Eddie Hickock Collins taught high school English in Baldwin, Long Island. Remedial readers whose attention spans kept them far away from Herman Melville or Nathaniel Hawthorne. Holden Caulfield in Catcher in The Rye, those seemed just right to Eddie, despite the fact that Catcher in The Rye was on the banned bookshelf of the school library.",
        "The library didn\u0027t like the use of the F word on page 201 of Catcher in The Rye. But page 201 was Eddie Collins\u0027 favorite page. And he figured his remedial readers would love it too. His young hooligans who all wanted and needed to get naked and needed page 201 thought Eddie.",
        "The school soon gave notice though. Under no circumstances was he to teach that dirty Catcher in The Rye. The F word, beloved page 201. They were deemed questionable and inappropriate.",
        "Eddie began reading the book aloud to his remedial class that day. And the remedial readers all took notice. They nodded and they grunted at all the good parts. And running their long, adolescent fingers over and over through their greasy pompadours as good, old Holden Caulfield rolled along. And cheering and chanting out the F word when Eddie tore into page 201.",
        "Edward Hickock Collins was fired from teaching high school English in Baldwin, Long Island. And he spent the rest of that year pacing in front of the fireplace at his mother\u0027s house.",
        "It was a cold winter, but Eddie was already heated up from his recent battle with censorship, so Eddie pulled off more and more of his clothes. His shirt, his shoes, his pants. And he flung them in all directions. Eddie built up the fire and he sweated aloud. If he couldn\u0027t teach the F word, how could he live free? That he demanded of himself. The F word, the sex act. That had to be naked and lovely. That felt right and right felt natural. And why hide that, Eddie thought. And that\u0027s when he first thought it. He would never dress again."

        "The most convincing evidence that Philip Weiss found in the Sprunt report had to do with the possibility that Vince Foster died somewhere other than Fort Marcy Park and that his body was moved there by someone.",
        "The report points out that there was no dirt on Foster\u0027s shoes, despite the fact that he was supposed to have walked through the park. There were no car keys found in his pocket despite the fact that he was supposed to have driven himself there. There was a missing briefcase, a misquoted witness, eyeglasses too far from the body, and contradictory accounts of what kind of gun was found in Foster\u0027s hand.",
        "And what did he say?",
        "So tell me a bit about when you first entered their world in the early weeks or months that you really started dealing with these people. What are they like? What are they like as a group?",
        "For most of the conspiracy theorists, the main event of the Clinton presidency is the death of Vince Foster. The official version of the facts of Foster\u0027s death concludes that on July 20, 1993, Vince Foster drove himself to Fort Marcy Park in suburban Virginia, parked his car, walked to a secluded spot, and shot himself. But as Philip Weiss found out, there\u0027s another version of the facts, meticulously cataloged in another document, an unofficial one."

        "Right. There was nothing theoretical about it. I was on a Greyhound bus.",
        "Then the fever broke.",
        "Oh, it was great. It was great. My mind was jumping all the time. And everything was fitting in. It was like a puzzle. It was like figuring out a puzzle. A big, jigsaw puzzle. And I would fit a piece in and then things would start to fit around it.",
        "Yes, it was automatic writing, Ira. It was automatic writing. It was like someone turned on a faucet.",
        "Nothing. Oh, what? Say again.",
        "I know, but I wanted to think about it more before I said that.",
        "Yeah, I do. I really do. Because there was electricity that was very exciting and I think I was much more interesting then. I mean, I think I\u0027m a little bit of a bore sometimes now.",
        "Yes, everything is everything.",
        "Yes.",
        "I am no longer unified. I was unified and now I\u0027m not unified anymore.",
        "The point of quitting is to move in the world and to get bigger and bigger as a person. See, God damn. Sometimes I just start to sound like a nut basically about this. Just what am I talking about? You know, what am I talking about? You have to understand, this is so on my mind. You know, I mean I think about this all the time. I think about this all the time. I\u0027m thinking about getting up and walking out of this room right now. You know, I really am.",
        "Right. I was able to navigate inside of me in terms of that one thing. So I was a unified person. And I actually had an identity.",
        "Looking at it that way makes it seem like I sacrificed something by moving away from it. But I didn\u0027t pick to move away from it. I mean, it abandoned me, Ira. It abandoned me. Really, it did.",
        "No, it stopped being available to me. It\u0027s not that I decided to stop thinking about it, it\u0027s that it decided to stop visiting me. It stopped calling me. It was terrible. It was horrible.",
        "There was a time actually, where I was very angry with the one thing. Because it had abandoned me and it was not available to me. It was like the quit and I had been friends, and then something happened and I didn\u0027t know what and I had done something terrible and the quit didn\u0027t come to my birthday party for no reason. And yeah, wouldn\u0027t call me and wouldn\u0027t write to me. And just disappeared, vanished, evaporated, abandoned me.",
        "Yes and no. Yes and no. The sad thing is that I don\u0027t really have a scheme. I attempted to embrace another framework.",
        "Yes.",
        "Picking.",
        "Picking.",
        "Picking anything. See, I\u0027m a big picker. I\u0027m a picker. And also, I like picking. For example, I once had a job as a strawberry picker, which I enjoyed very much. But then, that kind of picking. But also, the kind of picking, picking and choosing.",
        "Right, I guess so.",
        "It was really horrible. It was very, very horrible. And it actually happened in a very, very dramatic way. I was taking this cross country trip and I stopped traveling with the person with whom I was traveling, which was a very big deal. And I was sitting on a bus, a Greyhound bus, traveling from Santa Fe, New Mexico, and I could no longer think about the trip in terms of quitting because a quit of sorts had occurred and the person with whom I was splitting was too important to funnel into the quitting stream.",
        "There\u0027s that on one level, but then there\u0027s an even more serious level, which was that it was not possible to think of this as anything but what it was. That this was a relationship with a person who I love."

        "There was a large crowd at Eddie\u0027s trial for indecent exposure. When the judge walked solemnly in and the clerk called out, all please rise, Eddie slipped out of his kilt and his t-shirt and he did rise. The judge found him in contempt and the cops dragged him handcuffed and kilted from the courtroom. Eddie meaning to go willingly, but the crowd was too good to waste. So Eddie shouted over his shoulder, pulling away from the cops to urge them to join him for international nudity day. And the cops moved Edward Hickock Collins from the county jail to the county hospital.",
        "Now Eddie was a lamb at the hospital. He was polite and he was cooperative. He\u0027d had shock treatments before and he didn\u0027t wish to have them again. He needed his mind. But the doctors gave him Nembutals and Thorazine, large amounts. And his tongue thickened and his bright eyes grew heavily lidded. And he stumbled of his quotations of good old page 201. And after some weeks, all Eddie was really sure of was that the world would be better off naked. And he was the man to strip it bare. He hung onto that.",
        "Eddie got out on a deep, blue day and he wept because it was June and he was free with International Nudity Day just around the corner.",
        "Over the month, Eddie\u0027s plan spread and took wing. International Nudity Day, that\u0027s only a beginning. It\u0027s a great beginning. It\u0027s a campaign launcher. The Republican Convention, that\u0027s set for Kansas City, mere months away.",
        "The Republicans need to disarm now. The pants come down in simultaneous synchronization candidate. I\u0027m nude run messiah. That\u0027s the perfect choice for Kansas City. I\u0027m running. And I\u0027m running nude.",
        "And on the fourth of July, 200 of us gathered in the center of downtown. It was a place marked by the crossing of two lines of railroad tracks. Eddie arrived late, running up in his kilt and t-shirt and shaking hands and passing out campaign literature. Someone pulled a baby from the crowd for Eddie to kiss and the crowd cheered.",
        "And Eddie spoke, he was poignant in his wonder at the beauty of the human body. And then in simultaneous synchronization, the pants came down. I was there and it was great. We all pulled off our clothes. Really only about 30 of us did it, but we were all standing in the front so it felt like a crowd, a naked crowd. And Eddie was ecstatic. He beamed with joy and leaping about, his own clothes flew in all directions with an extra zip that day. The police moved in with paddy wagons, arresting the naked crowd. But they saved Eddie til last.",
        "And before they could reach him, a long freight train raced up the track, just as the cops were moving towards Eddie. He timed it perfectly. Waving and nodding he jumped over the tracks right in front of the engine, leaving the cop on the other side. And by the time the freight train had passed, Eddie was gone. He was already running and he was running nude.",
        "Eddie ran all the way to Kansas City, mostly at night. And Playboy magazine picked up his story and sent a reporter and a photographer to follow him. The pictures were all of Eddie naked eating banana splits with a bunch of old farm boys at a Stuckey\u0027s or posed on the seat of a big, hog Harley at a rest stop surrounded by big, hairy biker guys. Naked except for a McDonald\u0027s cap giving out free french fries and nudity now buttons under the shadow of the golden arches. Playboy magazine bailed him out each time he was arrested.",
        "But when he got to Kansas City, Eddie got cagey. This was the big time and he covered himself, his nude body, his kilt, and his t-shirt in a black three-piece suit he bought at the Salvation Army. He borrowed the Playboy writer\u0027s press ID and Eddie boldly moved behind Republican lines, making it to the front steps of the convention center. That was close enough.",
        "And the next day, Eddie found a fruit crate and he wrote soap all over it in black magic marker. And he returned to the convention steps, standing up high on the soap box above the crowd. His whole being overwhelmed with the moment, the power, of his big idea. Blurting out verbiage and joy, his clothes flying and hysterical in all directions. And there were brief looks of childlike wonder across Republican faces in the crowd, but then they were replaced with this all to adult frown of disgust and censor.",
        "The Kansas City cops, hard men who had been put on kook alert, knocked him from the soap box and they slammed him into the cement steps. And they dragged him bodily away. Eddie\u0027s anxious cry of nudity now drowned out by police radios and the charging march of police boots.",
        "And Eddie stayed in jail for the rest of the convention. His name would never appear on the Republican list of nominees that year. And like so many presidential candidates-- Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Ross Perot-- the early days of his campaign would prove to be the most memorable.",
        "Edward Hickock Collins had peaked too soon. He returned home to The Palace, but he was never quite the same. Eddie\u0027s confidence dropped after Kansas City. He had other big moments. Like attending his Yale class reunion football game and dropping his pants and dashing along the sidelines when Yale scored against Harvard. But each one of these episodes led to jail and more hospitals. Or a stream of Nembutals and shock treatments left Eddie struggling to keep a hold on his mind.",
        "It\u0027s strange when you think about it. That nudity would exact this kind of retribution from our society. Nudity. But Eddie stuck to his vision of the world, his one big idea. That a naked man is a free man and should be allowed to be free.",
        "The last I heard of him, he had moved back home to Baldwin, Long Island. Eddie began liberating the neighborhood cats and dogs of their leashes, their choke chains, and their flea collars. That\u0027s the thing about a messianic vision, about one big idea. If you follow it to its logical conclusion, you don\u0027t know where you\u0027ll end up.",
        "Eddie ended up reading to his cats and dogs, good old page 201 Cather in The Rye. The dogs and cats listened. They were animals. They had no problem with the F word. Nudity came naturally to them."

            "You know, sometimes I want to give it all, just like I give it all to my gang. I want to give it all to him. Even double, you know. I want to die for the lord. I don\u0027t care if I get crucified. I don\u0027t care if they shoot me.",
            "Yeah, exactly. It\u0027s like I have the same mentality and the same heart, but now it\u0027s for a different reason and a different person.",
            "I know how it is to beat somebody. I know how it is to pull the trigger, like drive by [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. I know what it is to pull the trigger. I know what it is to stand in the middle of the street, like a stop sign, throwing out gang signs and expecting a bullet to come to you or somebody to just whack you in the head or something.",
            "So he jumped in front of me before they were going to shoot me and he goes, no, he\u0027s a Christian now. He\u0027s a man of God. He\u0027s not a King anymore. That\u0027s the [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]. And the guy was like, no way, I know him. He ain\u0027t no Christian. He was like move and then he was going to hit me, right? I was ready to start hitting people and just run. You know just elbow him here, punch him here, and make so I can get out. It\u0027s like my mind was ready, boom, take control. Just start fighting. But I just like, wait a minute. No, I\u0027m not going to do that. God has changed me. I\u0027m a new creation like it says in the bible. Therefore, anybody who\u0027s in Christ a new creation, the old has gone, the new has come. And I am the new that has come.",
            "I just looked around. I was just like, hey. I just said, look, I\u0027m a man of God now. You do what you got to do. You know what I\u0027m saying? But I don\u0027t gang bang no more. And soon I hope to see you in our church praise the lord together. So he was like, man. So he got mad, real mad. He just said, forget you, man. And he walked away and all his boys walked back to the car and they didn\u0027t do nothing to me.",
            "The one I like the best is Stephen in the Book of Acts when he got stoned. I love that story because I feel like Stephen is me. Yeah, like I\u0027m Stephen. I\u0027m not, but like we got the same spirits, which we do. How they have him ready to persecute him and he\u0027s like, he\u0027s not afraid to tell the truth. In other words, he\u0027s down for his. He\u0027s willing to live and die for what he believes in. Just like when you\u0027re willing to live and die for gang bang. Like me, I was a Latin King. You know what I\u0027m saying? You got to live and die for that crown, right? And that\u0027s what he was dying for. He was dying for God. You know, our lord. He\u0027s there, he\u0027s been done. He\u0027s standing up firm. He\u0027s like, I don\u0027t care about anybody. Just like when you\u0027re on the street. I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m a Latin King. What\u0027s up? You know, I don\u0027t care. What\u0027s up? They beat their chests with their gang sign. You know, what\u0027s up? What\u0027s up? I\u0027m this and this and that. They\u0027re not afraid or ashamed to say who they are."

The belief might be God, or free market economics, or animal rights, or the ozone layer. And some people structure their lives around collecting old records, or around sex, or theater, or politics, or Star Trek, or basketball.",
            "I\u0027ve been a one thing person. Maybe you\u0027ve been a one thing person too. Arnie certainly was. And his new one thing, the lord, filled the same place in his life that the old one thing, the gang, used to.",

            "Well, today on our program, One Thing People. People who organize their lives around just one idea and the price they pay for that.",

Then when he was 17, some kids dragged him to youth group and church services until one day, he felt the presence of the lord and he believed. And Arnie quit his gang. He still organized his life around one thing, but now the one thing was God.",
            "But when you quit a street gang, one of the problems that you face is that your former enemies do not know that you\u0027ve quit. They see you on the street and they come after you.

You can\u0027t just publish a notice in the federal register in the classified ads of your local paper. And so guys kept coming up to Arnie on the street trying to fight him or shoot him.",

In other words, he\u0027s down for his. He\u0027s willing to live and die for what he believes in. Just like when you\u0027re willing to live and die for gang bang. Like me, I was a Latin King. You know what I\u0027m saying? You got to live and die for that crown, right? And that\u0027s what he was dying for. He was dying for God. You know, our lord. He\u0027s there, he\u0027s been done. He\u0027s standing up firm. He\u0027s like, I don\u0027t care about anybody. Just like when you\u0027re on the street. I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m a Latin King. What\u0027s up? You know, I don\u0027t care. What\u0027s up? They beat their chests with their gang sign. You know, what\u0027s up? What\u0027s up? I\u0027m this and this and that.

It only ceased when Quentin moved that we change the name of the group from Lovers of Leanne to Victims of Leanne. That motion was soundly defeated of course, and we voted to adjourn.",

            "At our regular Monday lunch, Leanne\u0027s mother told me a cute story. She says that when Leanne was seven, she fell while roller skating and badly skinned her knee. There was no permanent scarring fortunately. In an effort to console her, Leanne\u0027s mother recalls telling Leanne, if you don\u0027t stop crying, your boo-boo is going to think you don\u0027t like him. And that\u0027s why, to this day, Leanne endearingly refers to minor cuts and scrapes as Mr. Boo.",
            "I\u0027ve got the minutes to the most recent Leanne Anonymous Meeting, which I\u0027ll read to you now. It was our first meeting at Gatsby\u0027s. The bartender, Mark, graciously accommodated us by closing off the back room and supplying extra folding chairs. All in attendance praised the wisdom of moving these meetings from my apartment, which some of them had complained was not in neutral territory and it was getting kind of cramped in any case.",
            "On a related matter, Mark told me privately after the meeting that he appreciates our patronage, but he asks that in the future we try not to monopolize the jukebox. Or at least try to play a variety of songs. He\u0027s threatening to remove all the Hank Williams selections if he doesn\u0027t see some improvement. So let\u0027s all try to work some Patsy Cline in there or something, OK?",
            "Meeting started out. We ordered a first round and at Tom\u0027s suggestion, we dispensed with the reading of the minutes. We proceeded immediately to old business. The continuing debate on Leanne\u0027s eyes and whether they are turbulent sea green or sand fleck moon blue. They are, by the way, a sand fleck moon blue.",
            "But when it appeared there could be no middle ground on the issue, Dick stood up and announced, hey, you know, like Elton John says, who cares if they\u0027re blue or they\u0027re green. Those are the sweetest eyes I\u0027ve ever seen.",
            "The motion to adopt Dick\u0027s language carried unanimously and we collected more change for the jukebox.",
            "We ordered another round and conversation turned naturally to the rest of Leanne. Her quirky, perky nose, her funny, sunny smile, the perfect curve or her neck. Her soft shoulders and so on. Until petty jealousies precluded further discussion.",
            "OK, a Leanne announcement. My special friend, Jane, who has been so supportive during this difficult time has suggested that there might be a need for a group addressing the concerns of the lovers of the lovers of Leanne. Anybody who knows somebody who might be interested in such a group should have them write LeanneANON in care of this station.",
            "We all know what that music means. It\u0027s time for this week\u0027s Leanne challenge. Leanne is what she eats, but how well do you know what she eats? Everybody knows Leanne likes horseradish on her hamburgers. But what kind of horseradish?",
            "OK, here\u0027s a hint. She received a case of it last Christmas. The answer to last week\u0027s challenge was, you guessed it, from left to right. I know a lot of people thought there was a trick to that question, but there wasn\u0027t.",
            "Time for the mail. The mail ran heavy this week with entries to the Candid Leanne Photo Contest. I think I need to remind everybody that the rules clearly state that Leanne must be the only person shown in the photograph. In case any of you want to resubmit, I\u0027m going to extend the deadline for two weeks until May 23. Please remember entries can\u0027t be returned.",
            "OK, first letter. One of our far-flung correspondents, Myles, writes from Lexington, Kentucky.",
            "Good evening and welcome to Life Without Leanne. I\u0027m Larry and this is day 683. That\u0027s nearly 98 weeks since Leanne and I broke up.",
            "I\u0027m going to be in town in the near future and I was hoping to finally meet this Leanne I\u0027ve heard so much about. Do you have her phone number and address where I can write her directly?",
            "Well, Myles, there\u0027s really no need for that. Why don\u0027t you just send your correspondence to Leanne in care of me and I\u0027ll make sure she gets it.",
            "And we also have a letter here from Reggie of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, who writes in. I think this is very interesting. We\u0027ve gotten a number of letters like this.",
            "He writes, Larry, isn\u0027t it time you got on with your life? It\u0027s been nearly two years since Leanne broke up with you.",
            "Actually, we\u0027re a couple weeks short of that, but anyway.",
            "He says, it\u0027s been actually two years since Leanne broke up with you and I hate to tell you, pal, but it\u0027s over. O-V-E-R. But listen, he says, there are a lot of other chicks in the sea, my friend. And they\u0027re yours for the picking. Go for it.",
            "Well, Reggie. I don\u0027t know quite how to answer that. It\u0027s difficult to determine exactly what it is you\u0027re driving at. I mean, I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t share your bitter perspective and I don\u0027t really get all of your playground aphorisms. But please understand when I suggest this. You know nothing about love. But thanks for the letter, Regg. Your Larry Loves Leanne t-shirt is in the mail. That\u0027s it for Life Without Leanne this week. And let\u0027s hope it\u0027s the last week. I\u0027m Larry and I love Leanne.",
            "We\u0027re going to start out, as always, with our Leanne watcher of the week. My kudos go out to Mike of Evanston, Illinois, who called in with this eloquent report on a brief encounter he had with Leanne on April 28.",
            "Thanks, Mike. I think we all know what she was trying to say.",
            "I wish it all could be such good news. But unfortunately, Operation Terrible Mistake has not been the success that we anticipated and I\u0027m afraid we may have to rethink our strategy. As you may recall from our April 20 program, the objectives of Operation Terrible Mistake were to one, apply societal pressure. Two, foster emotional uncertainty. Three, precipitate reevaluation. And ideally, four, achieve reconciliation.",
            "When I brought up this plan, I suggested the following conversation starter when you would run into Leanne on the street or something. I suggested that you say something like, \"Leanne, I was so sorry to hear about you and Larry. You make such a wonderful couple, so I don\u0027t mind telling you I think you are making a terrible mistake. This is my own personal opinion on the matter.\"",
            "Now unfortunately, a number of well meaning individuals took this suggestion rather more literally than I intended and repeated it verbatim to Leanne. And some of it sounds like you were practicing it and it created an effect other than the one I desired. I\u0027ve now received word through an intermediary that Leanne request that I quote, \"Call off the zombies,\" unquote. We will honor her wishes as always. But I must emphasize, I cannot be held responsible for the behavior of individuals acting on their own initiative."

            "You know how an idea catches and grabs a hold of you? Maybe you\u0027ve had that. An idea that speaks to your most private imaginings and your deepest hurt feelings, your most secret strange joys. And that idea says, here I am. Change everything because I\u0027m here. I\u0027m perfect. I\u0027m enlightened by sexuality. I\u0027m the new laughing cure for cancer. I am my body and shape and in perfect yoga pose. And these ideas fuel so crucial that the access of your world turns to embrace them.",
            "Eddie\u0027s idea felt like that. And Eddie\u0027s idea was naked and it was obvious. It was without guilt or second thought. Nudity. Nudity now.",
            "Eddie ran naked all the way to the high school. It was his first nude run. His body was flapping like a ship that has come free of its moorings and is now spinning and reckless in the surf.",
            "And at the high school, all his former students, the remedial readers, they were playing manic playground basketball. And Eddie happily ran out on the court. He wanted to dunk a few in the glorious springtime. Dunk a few and then tell the smart guys of his new vision of freedom.",
            "And Eddie yelled in his joy as he hit the court, but his remedial readers weren\u0027t glad to see him. They turned away, laughing, embarrassed by Eddie\u0027s nakedness. And they refused to pass him the ball.",
            "And when Eddie persisted, he leaped at each one of the boys in turn. One of them grabbed the ball and smacked it into Eddie\u0027s face hard. So hard the ball flip stung and bled and Eddie\u0027s eyes filled with tears.",
            "Eddie was lost then. The remedial readers surrounded and hounded him. Oh, they flicked popsicle sticks and clouds of dirt at his exposed penis and his poor back side.",
            "And Eddie slammed the door of his mother\u0027s house. He was crying and he was shaking. And all the remedial readers, they gathered in a pack outside. They were flushed and they talked themselves into a deeper hatred. And one of them grabbed a brick and threw it through Eddie\u0027s mother\u0027s picture window and shattered it. And then there was such a roar of rage and hurt and it just ripped through Eddie\u0027s brain and he grabbed the same brick and he threw it back through the same window. The remaining glass just flying. And then, Eddie jumped through the now open window, falling and gashing his poor hands and his poor feet.",
            "The remedial readers running in all directions. Eddie landing on a lawn of glass. And when he looked up in the sky, written in huge letters of flaming black and red six feet high were the words, \"Why? Don\u0027t ask why. Live.\"",
            "And right then, something deep exploded in Eddie. And his face and his heart, his whole being, flushed with joy.",
            "Shock treatments are serious and they\u0027re undermining. And in Eddie, they led him to a decade of quiet years. Years in which he memorized D.H. Lawrence\u0027s Women in Love from cover to cover. But his body, his naked body, lay in waiting. Impatient for the day when the clothes would come off and his body could go public again.",
            "Eddie Hickock Collins came to Dekalb, Illinois, to work on the railroad. And he grew a huge, red beard that shouted out a fanfare wherever he went.",
            "The Palace was our vegetarian restaurant theater and coffeehouse. It was work and it was home for we young anti-war hippies. It was a workshop for our ideas on how to change the troubled world that we\u0027d been given by our parents. But it was also a refuge. And a magnet, a magnet for people who were obsessed with one idea. And for the odd.",
            "If your father was a mason and now you\u0027d lost your chi and you were doomed to wander the five room universe of The Palace looking for it. If you were hopelessly shy and allergic to the 20th century, and everything that made it tick. If you were a closet arsonist who just needed a place to rest and battle the flames inside you. If you were a bottom pincher who drank too much schnapps and read only 17th century literature, you were welcome at The Palace.",
            "You could bring your dogs and your books and your bare feet. And as long as you didn\u0027t drink Coca-Cola there and at least considered not paying your war taxes, you were welcome. And we would never call the police.",
            "Eddie set up outside The Palace, smiling and silent at first, and he offered his own newsletter, The Beast of Revelation. A passionate, journalistic banner that proclaims the beauty of the human body. The penis is glorious and the vagina is magical. They have to be seen to be believed argued The Beast of Revelations. And after Eddie had figured most of us, the hippie community of The Palace, had a grasp of his basic message, Eddie came in off the sidewalk and he began to talk to us.",
            "He was a public speaker. Could he speak there? Eddie we had a voice and his eyes were wide awake and the title of this first talk was, \"Nudity. Nudity Now.\"",
            "He quoted liberally from the D.H Lawrence\u0027s Women in Love. Lawrence is big. Oh, he\u0027s big. Nudity and orgasm equals freedom. That\u0027s what D.H Lawrence sees. And Lawrence sees me, Eddie. Lawrence agrees with Collins. Nudity, sexuality, they form a square knot of human perfection.",
            "Until the Catholic church and public education get ahold of you. Oh, they\u0027ll twist you and they\u0027ll shame you. And that\u0027s bad. It\u0027s bad. Read Lawrence. He knows. He\u0027s big. Nudity. Nudity now.",
            "We all laughed not knowing why. And at the end of each performance, we followed Eddie out on the sidewalk. Eddie tossing his clothes in all directions before running off, naked into the night. Dekalb was a small place, but by the next week when Eddie spoke there was a real crowd that followed him outside for his personal unveiling.",
            "Edward Hickock Collins blossomed with nudity and attention. And by the fourth week, with the crowd urging him on, the clothes came off on stage and Eddie became the nude public speaker. Speaking out, but speaking nude, he shouted.",
            "And Eddie now began his talks naked and he hung around naked. He could be found at The Palace at all hours naked. Sometimes we politely asked him to dress for an occasion like when someone\u0027s parents came to town and then Eddie would put on this kilt. A kilt he made out of a pair of cut-off jeans slashed free at the legs.",
            "Once my mom came to visit me at The Palace. And I don\u0027t know what mom expected, but what she got was Eddie, naked and relaxed. Eddie reading the New York Times book review section. It made me very nervous when Eddie sat down with my mother, but my mom loved the New York Times book reviews and Eddie must have sensed that because he offered it to her. And the two of them were soon chatting about books they would never have time to read. And quickly, they seemed comfortable together. And that was amazing to me, my mother fully clothed and Eddie not clothed at all.",
            "It was only when Eddie leaned over and asked something so private that my mother never told me what it was. That my mom flushed and stormed away from the table.",
            "And that\u0027s the thing about Eddie. As much as he could win you over, and I liked him, he would always find a way to push things just too far. As if any boundary or border was a foreign thing and it was to be disposed of and gotten through, no matter how you felt about it.",
            "Eddie moved into our house and invited some of The Palace women to sleep with him. And some of them were happy to do it until the most private details of their intimacy started showing up in his speeches, surrounded by big, blinking exclamation points. Look at this.",
            "The police came two months into Eddie\u0027s talks. Eddie was arrested. And soon now, this nude messiah would stand trial. And he felt that, messianic and alone and full of a vision of the world where the pants come down in simultaneous synchronization and whole nations freed from the shackles of clothing, walk freely and hang out in peace.",
            "And Eddie spent the weeks prior to his trial alternating phone calls to Brezhnev and the Kremlin and Jimmy Carter\u0027s White House. Eddie made his calls from the corner laundry mat, urging long distance operators to support his new strategy. International nudity day July 4. Disarm now. The pants come off in simultaneous synchronization for world peace. That\u0027s the hook. If you\u0027re naked, how can you take yourself seriously holding a tank or fondling a nuclear war head? You\u0027d have to set them down.",
            "Someone at the Kremlin actually answered one of Eddie\u0027s calls and Eddie just poured it on over the phone, his whole platform. But at the White House, they just put him on hold and left him there. Eddie hardly noticed. His campaign was heating up.",
            "Eddie Hickock Collins taught high school English in Baldwin, Long Island. Remedial readers whose attention spans kept them far away from Herman Melville or Nathaniel Hawthorne. Holden Caulfield in Catcher in The Rye, those seemed just right to Eddie, despite the fact that Catcher in The Rye was on the banned bookshelf of the school library.",
            "The library didn\u0027t like the use of the F word on page 201 of Catcher in The Rye. But page 201 was Eddie Collins\u0027 favorite page. And he figured his remedial readers would love it too. His young hooligans who all wanted and needed to get naked and needed page 201 thought Eddie.",
            "The school soon gave notice though. Under no circumstances was he to teach that dirty Catcher in The Rye. The F word, beloved page 201. They were deemed questionable and inappropriate.",
            "Eddie began reading the book aloud to his remedial class that day. And the remedial readers all took notice. They nodded and they grunted at all the good parts. And running their long, adolescent fingers over and over through their greasy pompadours as good, old Holden Caulfield rolled along. And cheering and chanting out the F word when Eddie tore into page 201.",
            "Edward Hickock Collins was fired from teaching high school English in Baldwin, Long Island. And he spent the rest of that year pacing in front of the fireplace at his mother\u0027s house.",
            "It was a cold winter, but Eddie was already heated up from his recent battle with censorship, so Eddie pulled off more and more of his clothes. His shirt, his shoes, his pants. And he flung them in all directions. Eddie built up the fire and he sweated aloud. If he couldn\u0027t teach the F word, how could he live free? That he demanded of himself. The F word, the sex act. That had to be naked and lovely. That felt right and right felt natural. And why hide that, Eddie thought. And that\u0027s when he first thought it. He would never dress again."

            "There was a large crowd at Eddie\u0027s trial for indecent exposure. When the judge walked solemnly in and the clerk called out, all please rise, Eddie slipped out of his kilt and his t-shirt and he did rise. The judge found him in contempt and the cops dragged him handcuffed and kilted from the courtroom. Eddie meaning to go willingly, but the crowd was too good to waste. So Eddie shouted over his shoulder, pulling away from the cops to urge them to join him for international nudity day. And the cops moved Edward Hickock Collins from the county jail to the county hospital.",
            "Now Eddie was a lamb at the hospital. He was polite and he was cooperative. He\u0027d had shock treatments before and he didn\u0027t wish to have them again. He needed his mind. But the doctors gave him Nembutals and Thorazine, large amounts. And his tongue thickened and his bright eyes grew heavily lidded. And he stumbled of his quotations of good old page 201. And after some weeks, all Eddie was really sure of was that the world would be better off naked. And he was the man to strip it bare. He hung onto that.",
            "Eddie got out on a deep, blue day and he wept because it was June and he was free with International Nudity Day just around the corner.",
            "Over the month, Eddie\u0027s plan spread and took wing. International Nudity Day, that\u0027s only a beginning. It\u0027s a great beginning. It\u0027s a campaign launcher. The Republican Convention, that\u0027s set for Kansas City, mere months away.",
            "The Republicans need to disarm now. The pants come down in simultaneous synchronization candidate. I\u0027m nude run messiah. That\u0027s the perfect choice for Kansas City. I\u0027m running. And I\u0027m running nude.",
            "And on the fourth of July, 200 of us gathered in the center of downtown. It was a place marked by the crossing of two lines of railroad tracks. Eddie arrived late, running up in his kilt and t-shirt and shaking hands and passing out campaign literature. Someone pulled a baby from the crowd for Eddie to kiss and the crowd cheered.",
            "And Eddie spoke, he was poignant in his wonder at the beauty of the human body. And then in simultaneous synchronization, the pants came down. I was there and it was great. We all pulled off our clothes. Really only about 30 of us did it, but we were all standing in the front so it felt like a crowd, a naked crowd. And Eddie was ecstatic. He beamed with joy and leaping about, his own clothes flew in all directions with an extra zip that day. The police moved in with paddy wagons, arresting the naked crowd. But they saved Eddie til last.",
            "And before they could reach him, a long freight train raced up the track, just as the cops were moving towards Eddie. He timed it perfectly. Waving and nodding he jumped over the tracks right in front of the engine, leaving the cop on the other side. And by the time the freight train had passed, Eddie was gone. He was already running and he was running nude.",
            "Eddie ran all the way to Kansas City, mostly at night. And Playboy magazine picked up his story and sent a reporter and a photographer to follow him. The pictures were all of Eddie naked eating banana splits with a bunch of old farm boys at a Stuckey\u0027s or posed on the seat of a big, hog Harley at a rest stop surrounded by big, hairy biker guys. Naked except for a McDonald\u0027s cap giving out free french fries and nudity now buttons under the shadow of the golden arches. Playboy magazine bailed him out each time he was arrested.",
            "But when he got to Kansas City, Eddie got cagey. This was the big time and he covered himself, his nude body, his kilt, and his t-shirt in a black three-piece suit he bought at the Salvation Army. He borrowed the Playboy writer\u0027s press ID and Eddie boldly moved behind Republican lines, making it to the front steps of the convention center. That was close enough.",
            "And the next day, Eddie found a fruit crate and he wrote soap all over it in black magic marker. And he returned to the convention steps, standing up high on the soap box above the crowd. His whole being overwhelmed with the moment, the power, of his big idea. Blurting out verbiage and joy, his clothes flying and hysterical in all directions. And there were brief looks of childlike wonder across Republican faces in the crowd, but then they were replaced with this all to adult frown of disgust and censor.",
            "The Kansas City cops, hard men who had been put on kook alert, knocked him from the soap box and they slammed him into the cement steps. And they dragged him bodily away. Eddie\u0027s anxious cry of nudity now drowned out by police radios and the charging march of police boots.",
            "And Eddie stayed in jail for the rest of the convention. His name would never appear on the Republican list of nominees that year. And like so many presidential candidates-- Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, Ross Perot-- the early days of his campaign would prove to be the most memorable.",
            "Edward Hickock Collins had peaked too soon. He returned home to The Palace, but he was never quite the same. Eddie\u0027s confidence dropped after Kansas City. He had other big moments. Like attending his Yale class reunion football game and dropping his pants and dashing along the sidelines when Yale scored against Harvard. But each one of these episodes led to jail and more hospitals. Or a stream of Nembutals and shock treatments left Eddie struggling to keep a hold on his mind.",
            "It\u0027s strange when you think about it. That nudity would exact this kind of retribution from our society. Nudity. But Eddie stuck to his vision of the world, his one big idea. That a naked man is a free man and should be allowed to be free.",
            "The last I heard of him, he had moved back home to Baldwin, Long Island. Eddie began liberating the neighborhood cats and dogs of their leashes, their choke chains, and their flea collars. That\u0027s the thing about a messianic vision, about one big idea. If you follow it to its logical conclusion, you don\u0027t know where you\u0027ll end up.",
            "Eddie ended up reading to his cats and dogs, good old page 201 Cather in The Rye. The dogs and cats listened. They were animals. They had no problem with the F word. Nudity came naturally to them."

This is a guy with a very Jimmy Stewart manner and a very casual manner, and he walked me through Fort Marcy Park with great patience, telling me his understanding of what happened on July 20, 1993 when Vince Foster\u0027s body was found. And Patrick\u0027s story is a very logical one. He had hundreds and thousands of facts at his fingertips that I was and am in no position really to challenge. He\u0027s done more research on this than I have.",

Given my understanding of how the world works, I\u0027m willing to accept that they have lied to me about this and that I got other things to do now.

But it\u0027s a study by Hugh Sprunt of Texas, Farmers Branch, Texas, outside Dallas, of the record in the Foster case. And it\u0027s brilliant. And when I read that, I realized that the questions that these people have raised about the events in Fort Marcy Park are not trivial and not nuts. They are serious, good, investigative questions."

There were no car keys found in his pocket despite the fact that he was supposed to have driven himself there. There was a missing briefcase, a misquoted witness, eyeglasses too far from the body, and contradictory accounts of what kind of gun was found in Foster\u0027s hand.",

            "For most of the conspiracy theorists, the main event of the Clinton presidency is the death of Vince Foster. The official version of the facts of Foster\u0027s death concludes that on July 20, 1993, Vince Foster drove himself to Fort Marcy Park in suburban Virginia, parked his car, walked to a secluded spot, and shot himself. But as Philip Weiss found out, there\u0027s another version of the facts, meticulously cataloged in another document, an unofficial one."

            "Act Five, Quitting Quitting. Back in 1994, Evan Harris quit everything in her life. Job her, boyfriend, her city. And she started to think about quitting as an abstract idea in and of itself. She started to develop a theory about quitting. She wanted to name the parts of quitting. And she started to publish a zine about quiting with a friend of hers. She\u0027s also published a book about quitting called, The Quit.",
            "And so then the fever broke?",
            "When quitting was all you thought about, back when quitting was all you thought about, what was that like now that you look back on it?",
            "When I hear this, I just picture you just sitting down and just pouring these pages out, page after page, like in a dream. Like in a seizure.",
            "See, but what in your life today can compete with that?",
            "No, no, you were saying nothing.",
            "The more Evan Harris looked around, the more it seemed like everything in the world was made up of quits and quitting. History seemed like a series of violent, elaborate quits by nations and peoples. People\u0027s personal lives seemed driven by a series of endings. Quitting became the lens, the one thing through which Evan Harris saw the world.",
            "Well, you know, like do you miss having that faucet going full force all the time?",
            "And now you don\u0027t organize your thinking about the world that way. Now everything doesn\u0027t come down to one thing. Everything is kind of everything?",
            "Do you think that you lost something by now seeing everything in the world as everything and not just boiling everything down to one thing?",
            "What?",
            "Unified, you mean everything added up to one idea?",
            "Can I ask you what else what else have you lost by giving up that phase of your life when you really believed?",
            "You mean it stopped seeming so interesting?",
            "And so you used to see quitting as being the engine behind everything around us. Do you feel like that is the best explanatory framework with which to understand your life?",
            "You did?",
            "That tape if from when I interviewed Evan Harris back in 1994. This is back when she made her big sets of quits. She was at the height of her quitting frenzy and her thinking about quitting. At the time she was trying to catalog still all the parts of quitting, the euphoria of the quit, the euphoria that you feel when you get a quit.",
            "What was that?",
            "Picking?",
            "Meaning what?",
            "Well, I mean as you say that, I mean it occurs to me that this whole scheme is just the mirror opposite of quitting, really. I mean, it\u0027s just somebody picking stuff instead of somebody quitting stuff, right?",
            "Evan Harris.",
            "Well now, Evan Harris has quit quitting. Three years after that. Or it quit her. She no longer is in the throes of one thing. I talked to her about it last week.",
            "Because the quitting streaming includes the idea of that when you quit you will feel good? That\u0027s almost like one of your definitions of quitting from back then.",
            "Right. And it wasn\u0027t just this theoretical quit."
