And, as you probably know, each week on our program, we choose some theme, invite a variety of writers and performers and documentary producers to tackle that theme. And this week, as we, all of us, stand in that magical five-week period, that magical interregnum between the turkey of Thanksgiving and the turkey of Christmas, that magical five weeks where Americans consume nearly a fourth of all the turkey we consume over the course of the year, 67 million turkeys. So in this period, we bring you our annual Poultry Slam, stories about turkeys, chickens, ducks, fowl of all kind, and their mysterious hold over us."

Three times, by the way, that\u0027s three times the number in the public radio network. According to the people who syndicate Chickenman, it has been translated into German, into Dutch, into Swedish. It is still on the air, they say, in several dozen markets, making it one of the longest running radio features anywhere. Chickenman. Chickenman existed years before National Public Radio existed as a national network.

This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You\u0027d think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself. I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, \"I know. I\u0027ll take the turkey\u0027s head and attach it to the foot.\" Why would you do that? And more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?"

I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all.

        "Well, it\u0027s a funny thing. I\u0027ve discovered that over half the country is just awash in chicken blood. It\u0027s a substance that comes in so handy. It\u0027s rather like-- gosh, I don\u0027t know-- it flows like milk does in America or Dr. Bronner\u0027s chamomile soap or some other easily spilled liquid in modern America. It\u0027s an incredibly versatile product. You can lose bad luck with it. You can strengthen a faulty muscle with it. You can improve your eyesight with it. You can find lost items with it. You can get your wife back with it. You can transfer your bad luck to someone else with it.",
        "I mean, I had someone tell me that there is a ceremony involving the killing of a chicken in a rather baroque manner, which I\u0027ll describe to you. But this is a very specific ceremony that involved losing your court papers at court.",
        "Allow me to describe the ceremony.",
        "Yeah, you are arrested. A court date is set. You then go home to your witch doctor. You bring him a white chicken. It has to be a white chicken. The witch doctor then prescribes some muti, which is medicine. It can come in many, many forms. Perhaps it\u0027s a powder. Perhaps it\u0027s a liquid. It doesn\u0027t really matter because you\u0027re going to take the muti yourself. You then take the chicken and the muti to the nearest mountain. You climb to the top of the mountain. You dig a hole. You dig a hole large enough for the chicken to fit in. You then speak to the chicken. You say to the chicken, \"This is what I want to have happen. I would like my United States federal court tax document, file number 869102b, to disappear.\" Or whatever it is that you want to disappear.",
        "You then take a large sewing needle, and you poke the chicken\u0027s eyes out with this sewing needle. You then bury the chicken, the now blind chicken, alive in the hole. You put him in the hole. You put the dirt back on.",
        "Magic is funny, Ira. What can I say? Essentially, it\u0027s the end of the ceremony. You leave the chicken, and then you go. And as it was described to me, you go back to your court date on the day of your court date, and your papers will be lost. People will say to you, \"You have no papers. You are free.\" That\u0027s how it was described to me.",
        "Well, the gentleman I spoke to has heard of this working. He has not actually been arrested himself and caused his papers to disappear in this manner. But apparently, there are gangs of chicken rustlers here, not unlike cattle rustling in Western movies.",
        "Cattle rustlers.",
        "Chicken rustlers, I swear.",
        "Chicken rustling?",
        "Well, I think as I picture a chicken rustle, they probably wait until the sun goes down. And they probably have a sack, because if you stick a chicken in a sack, she is not going to make noise. So they probably chuck a bunch of chickens in the sack, as many as they can get away with until the chickens who are not in the sack start making noise. And then they run away. That\u0027s how I envision a chicken rustling.",
        "Luca Brasi sleeps with the chickens. I don\u0027t know.",
        "Hi, Ira, this is Michael in South Africa. Listen, about the item that we spoke about, the turkey\u0027s head attached to the turkey\u0027s foot, well, I spoke to some sangomas, which are witch doctors in the neighborhood about that thing. And they\u0027ve never heard of anything quite like it or seen anything quite like it. However, when I would describe it to them, their jaws dropped. But look, I discovered a whole bunch about poultry in South Africa, so call me back, OK?"

        "July 19, 1992. This afternoon at the 26th Street flea market, I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. Not shop like grocery shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name. I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. \"That\u0027s collectible,\" the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?",
        "Last weekend at the flea market, I saw this thing, a taxidermy turkey\u0027s head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You\u0027d think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself. I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, \"I know. I\u0027ll take the turkey\u0027s head and attach it to the foot.\" Why would you do that? And more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?",
        "I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. \"$45,\" the dealer said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air, and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. \"All right,\" she said, \"35, 30.\" But she could have gone up. \"All right, 85, 120, 370.\" I had no choice but to follow wherever she led me. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all. I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey\u0027s head and nothing else mattered.",
        "Tomorrow, what\u0027s that? Yesterday doesn\u0027t count. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own. On the way home, I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, \"I\u0027ll give you 100, no $500,000 if you can guess what I\u0027ve got in this paper sack.\" And I swear that not one of them could have come up with the right answer. I walked home 30 blocks, looking everyone square in the eye and thinking, \"Sucker.\""

        "You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that. Or you may think I\u0027m exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. \"I couldn\u0027t afford niggers,\" he told my sister Billie, \"so I had daughters.\"",
        "At 6 o\u0027clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up, we ate supper, and we went to bed. That\u0027s the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died. At midnight, mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them one after the other.",
        "When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, \"Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?\" The answer is yes. Some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that\u0027s not how 3,000 die in one night. They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate. We called it piling.",
        "It wasn\u0027t unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn\u0027t someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door. But this was worse than any pile we\u0027d seen. Turkeys who\u0027d never spent a night outdoors, panicked by thunder and lightning and rain in sheets. All we could do was pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group. After a while, standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing some more, you don\u0027t know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don\u0027t care. Maybe we saved some.",
        "The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. 3,000 dead turkeys sitting in the Missouri sun for two days. The company that owned the turkeys had them insured against acts of God, so we couldn\u0027t do anything until the insurance inspector had seen them. He came, a man from town in a white shirt and tie who held his handkerchief over his face when he got close to the truck. He made no pretense of counting, just stood there gagging.",
        "After he left, Daddy shoveled the turkeys into Dead Turkey Gulch. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days.",
        "The day before the night 3,000 thousand turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range. This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. Then, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures. Usually, men in trucks come and take them to the range at night. This time, daddy decided we\u0027d herd them ourselves.",
        "It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute and into the pen. And that\u0027s the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. \"Let\u0027s work straight through, he said. \"We\u0027ll be done by 10:00.\"",
        "By the time turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day. You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn\u0027t know that then.",
        "We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight. The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I\u0027ve seen turkeys clamor against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I\u0027ve seen them rush toward a screaming child trying to kill it, and I\u0027ve seen them run from a screaming child spooked and terrified.",
        "These turkeys didn\u0027t want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in, but there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight, which the turkeys would not touch. We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with his legs, forcing them into the sun.",
        "Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor\u0027s farm, into the road.",
        "We didn\u0027t own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits. With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him anytime we weren\u0027t in school, all for no pay. And if we weren\u0027t paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised.",
        "It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration. As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on."

He thinks he\u0027s really good-looking and strong and that he\u0027s really smart and has a lot of friends.",

And he had a cape on and black, villain slash hero goggles. He lost the outfit pretty quickly, and he went naked. And then he became Ashley\u0027s vehicle for torturing me.",

But I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it\u0027s very easy to demonstrate those feelings in a way that it\u0027s not as easy to demonstrate those feelings toward my sister, just because we never got in the habit of it.",
            "Ashley\u0027s very considerate and kind and thoughtful. And very, very sensitive to other people, very, very concerned about if other people are happy, and if someone else doesn\u0027t feel good. And Duki has this total, what\u0027s for lunch attitude. Like what\u0027s in it for me? In your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.",
            "Well, the really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Duki, but I think as we\u0027ve gotten older and older, we\u0027ve gotten more and more self-conscious about the Duki factor in our relationship. But I think a big chunk. I mean, it definitely gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn\u0027t have otherwise."

            "Act One, Duki. So in Danielle\u0027s family, the power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it--",
            "Of Danielle.",
            "And would she move?",
            "Now if Ashley would tell her, if Ashley would sit down on the couch and say to Danielle, \"Move the pork,\" what would the effect of that be?",
            "Is there anything about the life of a duck that perhaps you could tell our radio audience that we might not know? I\u0027m sure that you know much more about it than we do.",
            "You\u0027re not in touch with the whole scene, yeah.",
            "Well, 19 years after Duki arrived in the Mattoon household, the fluffy whiteness is long gone. Fluffy, in fact, is not a word you would really use to describe Duki. Nor is two-eyed, if I remember correctly.",
            "Well, the story of a 27-year-old graduate student who talks like a duck naturally brings us to the story of Chickenman. Chickenman first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969. Nearly everyday, there would be a new episode. These were these short little things, each one two minutes long or so, starting on WCFL here in Chicago, but spreading to over 1,500 radio stations. Three times, by the way, that\u0027s three times the number in the public radio network. According to the people who syndicate Chickenman, it has been translated into German, into Dutch, into Swedish. It is still on the air, they say, in several dozen markets, making it one of the longest running radio features anywhere. Chickenman. Chickenman existed years before National Public Radio existed as a national network. Chickenman will continue probably years after we\u0027re all gone like the mighty cockroach, like-- I don\u0027t know-- like the bagel, like [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Chickenman endures, will endure.",
            "Well, coming up later in the program, we\u0027ll have the first new real Chicken episode since 1969, written especially for This American Life by Dick Orkin, the voice of Chickenman. But first, before that, let\u0027s hear what all the fuss was about.",
            "Very tattered.",
            "All right, I\u0027ve been at Danielle\u0027s apartment sometimes, and I\u0027ve witnessed the following scene. Picture, please. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks. She picks up the phone, calls Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, \"Can you put Duki on?\" And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the phone. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That\u0027s the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied. These are adults. Danielle is an editor at a big New York magazine.",
            "I love these. Do you want to hear another? We have time for another. You want to hear another? The thing I love is how completely low-key the performances are. It\u0027s like they\u0027re not even trying. It\u0027s a complete aesthetic. All right, let\u0027s hear one more before we continue with the next act.",
            "So I hope it\u0027s becoming clear why, if you eat dinner in the home of Danielle\u0027s family, if they\u0027re serving some kind of poultry, chicken or turkey, if you were to ask anybody in the family what\u0027s for dinner, they\u0027ll tell you--",
            "Right. And the rationale for that is what?",
            "Well, coming up, life on a real turkey farm, David Sedaris, and, of course, the first new episode of Chickenman since the Nixon administration, written just for our program. That\u0027s all in a minute when our program continues.",
            "It freaks him out-- you don\u0027t like him to know that perhaps some birds are in fact eaten?",
            "Right.",
            "Now, I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this program. So I contacted Danielle\u0027s sister, Ashley, and asked her, \"Could Duki come on the air?\" I received an answer back, not by phone, but by electronic mail, that for Duki to appear, I\u0027d have to first go through someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley\u0027s mother. And when I talked to Danielle, I asked her about this.",
            "I\u0027ve been informed that the only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu. Do I have that name right?",
            "Yona Lu is?",
            "That\u0027s right. And they call it that for a reason. And the reason has to do with a stuffed hand puppet called Duki. Now Danielle is nearly 30 years old. Her sister, Ashley, is two years younger. And Duki has been in the family since they were children.",
            "Anything special that I should say to Yona Lu to make this happen?",
            "Hey, Mrs. Mattoon.",
            "It\u0027s Ira Glass.",
            "Mrs. Mattoon, here\u0027s why I called you. I want to do a little story on the radio about Duki.",
            "Duki. And I contacted your daughter, Ashley. And she said that for me to book Duki onto my radio show, I was going to first need to contact Yona Lu.",
            "And that I needed to do that through you.",
            "Who is Yona Lu?",
            "Well, I don\u0027t know actually. I mean, we--",
            "Well, so what do I do now? I was told to contact you if I wanted to get in touch with Yona Lu in order to book Duki. What do I do next?",
            "That\u0027s the whole idea. I want to book Duki for the show, for an interview.",
            "Now, it\u0027s not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle dominated Ashley. Ashley looked up to Danielle, fought to get her attention and her approval, and Danielle always, always got her way, except when Duki was around. Basically, Ashley would channel-- I mean the word is an anachronism in this context, but she would channel Duki. She should become Duki\u0027s voice. She would speak as Duki. And Duki was sarcastic. Duki was selfish and bossy. Duki would insult Danielle. Duki would tease Danielle. Duki would give her painful nose squeaks.",
            "Will Yona Lu want to discuss terms or something?",
            "So what\u0027s going to happen? All right, should I call you back?",
            "You\u0027ll just go in and check?",
            "Should I wait?",
            "All right, I\u0027ll wait.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It\u0027s just radio.",
            "No, no one\u0027s going to be on TV. No, it\u0027s strictly radio.",
            "What if it were TV?",
            "All right, as you might imagine, not everybody in the family takes all this so lightly. Danielle\u0027s father was never too keen on this.",
            "Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley\u0027s personality.",
            "Really?",
            "Yeah, that period that you\u0027re describing, when do you mean?",
            "And they would only communicate through the duck?",
            "And how long did this last?",
            "What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with Duki?",
            "Well, I did finally snag an interview with Duki. You know, big network radio program that we are, we could pull off this coup, snag for you this interview with an imaginary hand puppet. Anyway, I did make this happen by calling Ashley.",
            "Is Duki still up for this?",
            "He just got back from a party?",
            "All right, well, could you get him?",
            "Hey, Duki?",
            "He\u0027s boastful and vain.",
            "I\u0027m just fine.",
            "Long time no see back at you. And welcome to our little radio program.",
            "Well, we actually have a number of different people.",
            "They\u0027re just like Tom Cruise.",
            "Now, Duki, I was talking to Danielle for our radio program, and had her come on and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that when she was younger, in order to discipline her if she was doing something that you didn\u0027t like, you could pretty much control her with something called nose squeaks?"

Chickenman first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969. Nearly everyday, there would be a new episode. These were these short little things, each one two minutes long or so, starting on WCFL here in Chicago, but spreading to over 1,500 radio stations. Three times, by the way, that\u0027s three times the number in the public radio network.

            "You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that. Or you may think I\u0027m exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. \"I couldn\u0027t afford niggers,\" he told my sister Billie, \"so I had daughters.\"",
            "At 6 o\u0027clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up, we ate supper, and we went to bed. That\u0027s the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died. At midnight, mother woke us up. \"We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us.\" We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them one after the other.",
            "When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, \"Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?\" The answer is yes. Some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that\u0027s not how 3,000 die in one night. They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate. We called it piling.",
            "It wasn\u0027t unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn\u0027t someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door. But this was worse than any pile we\u0027d seen. Turkeys who\u0027d never spent a night outdoors, panicked by thunder and lightning and rain in sheets. All we could do was pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group. After a while, standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing some more, you don\u0027t know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don\u0027t care. Maybe we saved some.",
            "The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. 3,000 dead turkeys sitting in the Missouri sun for two days. The company that owned the turkeys had them insured against acts of God, so we couldn\u0027t do anything until the insurance inspector had seen them. He came, a man from town in a white shirt and tie who held his handkerchief over his face when he got close to the truck. He made no pretense of counting, just stood there gagging.",
            "After he left, Daddy shoveled the turkeys into Dead Turkey Gulch. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days.",
            "The day before the night 3,000 thousand turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range. This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. Then, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures. Usually, men in trucks come and take them to the range at night. This time, daddy decided we\u0027d herd them ourselves.",
            "It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute and into the pen. And that\u0027s the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. \"Let\u0027s work straight through, he said. \"We\u0027ll be done by 10:00.\"",
            "By the time turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day. You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn\u0027t know that then.",
            "We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight. The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I\u0027ve seen turkeys clamor against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I\u0027ve seen them rush toward a screaming child trying to kill it, and I\u0027ve seen them run from a screaming child spooked and terrified.",
            "These turkeys didn\u0027t want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in, but there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight, which the turkeys would not touch. We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with his legs, forcing them into the sun.",
            "Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor\u0027s farm, into the road.",
            "We didn\u0027t own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits. With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him anytime we weren\u0027t in school, all for no pay. And if we weren\u0027t paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised.",
            "It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration. As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on."

But that\u0027s not how 3,000 die in one night. They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate. We called it piling."

All we could do was pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group. After a while, standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing some more, you don\u0027t know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don\u0027t care.

We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front.

            "July 19, 1992. This afternoon at the 26th Street flea market, I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. Not shop like grocery shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name. I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. \"That\u0027s collectible,\" the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?",
            "Last weekend at the flea market, I saw this thing, a taxidermy turkey\u0027s head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You\u0027d think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself. I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, \"I know. I\u0027ll take the turkey\u0027s head and attach it to the foot.\" Why would you do that? And more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?",
            "I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. \"$45,\" the dealer said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air, and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. \"All right,\" she said, \"35, 30.\" But she could have gone up. \"All right, 85, 120, 370.\" I had no choice but to follow wherever she led me. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all. I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey\u0027s head and nothing else mattered.",
            "Tomorrow, what\u0027s that? Yesterday doesn\u0027t count. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own. On the way home, I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, \"I\u0027ll give you 100, no $500,000 if you can guess what I\u0027ve got in this paper sack.\" And I swear that not one of them could have come up with the right answer. I walked home 30 blocks, looking everyone square in the eye and thinking, \"Sucker.\""

Not shop like grocery shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name. I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. \"That\u0027s collectible,\" the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?"

This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You\u0027d think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself. I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, \"I know. I\u0027ll take the turkey\u0027s head and attach it to the foot.\" Why would you do that? And more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?"

I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all. I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey\u0027s head and nothing else mattered."

And I asked him to look into the uses of chicken and other poultry among the sangoma culture in South Africa. Sangomas, or witch doctors or herbalists or orators, you hear them called sometimes, they\u0027re common in South Africa. Everybody seems to know one. And chickens are one of their main tools.",

It\u0027s just too big a word. It\u0027s too grand a word. You don\u0027t hear the strands of Aaron Copland when the word rustle comes up next to the word chicken. Hold on for a second.

            "Well, it\u0027s a funny thing. I\u0027ve discovered that over half the country is just awash in chicken blood. It\u0027s a substance that comes in so handy. It\u0027s rather like-- gosh, I don\u0027t know-- it flows like milk does in America or Dr. Bronner\u0027s chamomile soap or some other easily spilled liquid in modern America. It\u0027s an incredibly versatile product. You can lose bad luck with it. You can strengthen a faulty muscle with it. You can improve your eyesight with it. You can find lost items with it. You can get your wife back with it. You can transfer your bad luck to someone else with it.",
            "I mean, I had someone tell me that there is a ceremony involving the killing of a chicken in a rather baroque manner, which I\u0027ll describe to you. But this is a very specific ceremony that involved losing your court papers at court.",
            "Allow me to describe the ceremony.",
            "Yeah, you are arrested. A court date is set. You then go home to your witch doctor. You bring him a white chicken. It has to be a white chicken. The witch doctor then prescribes some muti, which is medicine. It can come in many, many forms. Perhaps it\u0027s a powder. Perhaps it\u0027s a liquid. It doesn\u0027t really matter because you\u0027re going to take the muti yourself. You then take the chicken and the muti to the nearest mountain. You climb to the top of the mountain. You dig a hole. You dig a hole large enough for the chicken to fit in. You then speak to the chicken. You say to the chicken, \"This is what I want to have happen. I would like my United States federal court tax document, file number 869102b, to disappear.\" Or whatever it is that you want to disappear.",
            "You then take a large sewing needle, and you poke the chicken\u0027s eyes out with this sewing needle. You then bury the chicken, the now blind chicken, alive in the hole. You put him in the hole. You put the dirt back on.",
            "Magic is funny, Ira. What can I say? Essentially, it\u0027s the end of the ceremony. You leave the chicken, and then you go. And as it was described to me, you go back to your court date on the day of your court date, and your papers will be lost. People will say to you, \"You have no papers. You are free.\" That\u0027s how it was described to me.",
            "Well, the gentleman I spoke to has heard of this working. He has not actually been arrested himself and caused his papers to disappear in this manner. But apparently, there are gangs of chicken rustlers here, not unlike cattle rustling in Western movies.",
            "Cattle rustlers.",
            "Chicken rustlers, I swear.",
            "Chicken rustling?",
            "Well, I think as I picture a chicken rustle, they probably wait until the sun goes down. And they probably have a sack, because if you stick a chicken in a sack, she is not going to make noise. So they probably chuck a bunch of chickens in the sack, as many as they can get away with until the chickens who are not in the sack start making noise. And then they run away. That\u0027s how I envision a chicken rustling.",
            "Luca Brasi sleeps with the chickens. I don\u0027t know.",
            "Hi, Ira, this is Michael in South Africa. Listen, about the item that we spoke about, the turkey\u0027s head attached to the turkey\u0027s foot, well, I spoke to some sangomas, which are witch doctors in the neighborhood about that thing. And they\u0027ve never heard of anything quite like it or seen anything quite like it. However, when I would describe it to them, their jaws dropped. But look, I discovered a whole bunch about poultry in South Africa, so call me back, OK?"

            "Act Five, Chickenman, Like the Phoenix. As a child, I did not care about the radio. In fact, I have to say that there was only one thing that I remember hearing on the radio up until the age of 16, I\u0027d say. And that was Chickenman. It had all these qualities of radio that I\u0027ve since come to value. It was surprising. It was funny. It had its own sound, a sound that was completely distinctive and instantly recognizable and appealing. Dick Orkin was the voice of Chickenman, and in the years since Chickenman, he\u0027s done tons of work, including lots of commercials in that deadpan style, a style which hundreds of people all over the country have tried to imitate. Nobody ever gets it right.",
            "And it\u0027s a pleasure, it\u0027s an honor to have him on our program. Last year when This American Life was just a local program in Chicago, before you could hear it around the country, we invited Dick Orkin to create a new Chickenman episode for our Poultry Slam. And he put a cast together, put together the first new episode since 1969. In this episode, Chickenman is a quarter century older, like his creator, and he faces a new set of problems.",
            "Well, \"Chickenman Challenges a Fate Named Frank\" was recorded at Dick Orkin\u0027s radio ranch in Hollywood, California. Along with Dick Orkin, the cast included Allison Ann Martin, Miriam Flynn, Charlie Brill, and Jim Gallant. Engineers Elizabeth Lane and James [? Burns, ?] written by Dick Orkin and Christine Coyle. Miss Flynn\u0027s hairstyle by Mr. Bunny. If you want more information about Chickenman, it is on the internet with sound files that you can get at this address, www.radio-ranch.com."

It had all these qualities of radio that I\u0027ve since come to value. It was surprising. It was funny. It had its own sound, a sound that was completely distinctive and instantly recognizable and appealing. Dick Orkin was the voice of Chickenman, and in the years since Chickenman, he\u0027s done tons of work, including lots of commercials in that deadpan style, a style which hundreds of people all over the country have tried to imitate.
