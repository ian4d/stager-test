Now it\u0027s also a TV show, also called Dangerous Minds. And now, every week, LuAnne Johnson can turn on the TV and see a teacher with her same name march around and do things she thinks are unethical, inadvisable, and sometimes just plain silly, like holding a school fundraiser in a strip club."

In our program today, Act One, Dangerous Minds. Act Two-- Act Two is actually a found tape of Satan\u0027s own telemarketer. Act Three, Voyager. Act Four, Carmen Becomes Faust. Act Five, First Contact. Stay with us."

        "Classical music, like ballet or gymnastics, is a discipline with a torrentious aesthetic. The greater the sacrifice, the bigger the hero. And to Peabody, a second-rate music school in a second-rate town, Jayna\u0027s sacrifice and talent were Olympian. We were all awed. No one so young played so well.",
        "Jayna moved in with a host family, the Kilsteads. Carla Kilstead, another Senofsky student, was about the same age as Jayna and I. We would all hang out together, play Space Invaders in the Peabody lounge and beg money off our moms for the candy machines.",
        "Then I remember you being in the car with my mom, and me, and Carla.",
        "This was the first time ever. And I remember we were driving past the Inner Harbor, and there was a ship.",
        "Jayna says the first couple of years in America were everything she wanted them to be. Everything was new. Everything was interesting. Her life with her host family was good. She did well in competitions, and Senofsky got his manager to set up some concerts for her in Holland. Then, after two years of study at Peabody, Jayna went back to Korea for the first time. And when she came back to America, things started to fall apart. Her relationship with her host family deteriorated.",
        "She left that host family and moved in with another and then left them for another. More was expected of Jayna than of any of us, and she was essentially raising herself. She was lonely and started to miss her family in Korea. At one point, she called her mom.",
        "Jayna and I meet in the courtyard of the Peabody Conservatory of Music, then walk down the street to Louis\u0027s Bookstore Cafe. When we were teenagers, Jayna and I would go to Louis\u0027s between orchestra and violin lessons. We\u0027d eat fish sandwiches, talk about music, and gawk at the art boys.",
        "I remember Jayna during this part of her life. I remember driving her back from orchestra rehearsal and sitting with her in my car outside her house. I was 16 and she was 14. I remember her telling me about the problems in her family back home in Korea. Her father was having financial difficulties. Her brother was having trouble getting into the right college, which in Korea determines your whole future. And her sister had had some kind of breakdown and had been put into a mental institution.",
        "It was all very draining, and Jayna was having a hard time. But what I remember best was that these crises somehow forced Jayna to think about her decision to come to America in a new way. Watching her family struggle from a distance somehow brought her face to face with her own distance from them and from her culture. I remember her telling me that she felt she could never go back to Korea, that she had missed too much.",
        "In the world of classical music, if you don\u0027t make it as a soloist by the time you\u0027re 16 or 17, odds are you\u0027re never going to make it. At 20, it hadn\u0027t happened for Jayna. She was still practicing and competing, but it was more of a struggle.",
        "Someone recently wrote that the tragedy of Bob Dole is not only that he sold out his principles and sold out everything he ever believed in to become president, this deficit hawk who campaigned on the kind of tax cut he used to ridicule as voodoo economics, but that after he sold out his principles and his soul, he discovered that there were no buyers.",
        "Jayna\u0027s story reminds me of that. She agrees that yes, she made a Faustian bargain. She left her family, left her country, left her home. But she never got the fame and fortune she made all those sacrifices for. And when I talked to her, I somehow expected her to be as conflicted about it as she was when we were in my car at 16. But in fact, she was fine with it. Her feelings have changed, and she\u0027s outgrown the premise of the bargain. She doesn\u0027t particularly want to be a soloist, and she\u0027s not driven for fame.",
        "With or without violin, Jayna clearly prefers life in America to the restricted life she would have had in Korea. And though recently her parents have started talking about coming to the States, moving in with her so that they can be closer, she finds these conversations make her nervous. She doesn\u0027t want to give up the independence she\u0027s had since she was 11.",
        "Jayna is Korean. When Jayna was 11, Jayna, her mother, her violin teacher, and her aunt, all drove four hours from the small town where she grew up to Seoul, South Korea\u0027s capital. They went to a big hotel, the hotel where all the Korean celebrities and international tourists stayed, and went to the room of violinist Berl Senofsky. She played him the Mendelssohn violin concerto.",
        "Jayna\u0027s now 23. She\u0027s still at Peabody. She gigs with the Lyric Opera Orchestra and Young Concert Artists\u0027 Orchestra in Baltimore. She has a sponsor, a businessman in North Carolina who heard her perform and now helps her with a monthly check. At her apartment, after playing three songs for me, Jayna stops and is about to put her violin away. She asks, should I keep playing? And I say, sure, play more. No, she says, I mean the violin. Jayna\u0027s still wondering.",
        "No one in Jayna\u0027s family really knew what she\u0027d be getting into if she accepted Senofsky\u0027s offer to go to America. But it was clear from the beginning that if Jayna went, she would go alone.",
        "Later, at Jayna\u0027s house, she brings out the violin. I ask her to play me the Mendelssohn, the song that she played for Mr. Senofsky, the song that literally divided her life into past and present. The opening melody is famous for being hard to play.",
        "I remember the first time I saw Jayna. She was short and chubby, and dressed in a red Korean coat. Immediately after coming to America, Jayna dropped about 20 pounds. I remember people whispering that she was chubby when she arrived because meals were the only time that Jayna\u0027s strict Korean mother would allow her to stop practicing. There were other rumors, all part of the Jayna mystique, the young Korean prodigy who had sacrificed so much, come alone from Korea to study in Baltimore."

        "Was this like the first time ever that I came to Peabody?",
        "Ship. That was my first curse word, because, yeah, you and Carla were trying to teach me. Like, you guys just took me by the hand, OK, look, see, that\u0027s a ship. And I was like, ah, ah, [BLEEP], [BLEEP].",
        "I don\u0027t know what it was, but I think like around the third year, or something like that that I was living with them, I really started to feel like my presence there was a burden to them, you know? And that\u0027s when it started getting hard, because then I realized, oh my gosh, what am I doing? I\u0027ve been here, I\u0027ve been living with a family that\u0027s not mine, basically strangers. What can they possibly like about this?",
        "Well, I was really upset. So I called and I was crying, and I said, you know, can I just come back and just go back to school there? At least let me try that and see if that works. And I was really hoping, if not assuming, that my mother would just say, sure, come back, you know?",
        "She said, that\u0027s ridiculous. You\u0027ve been there for so long now, and now you have to carry on what you\u0027ve been doing. And I just remember hanging up. I don\u0027t remember exactly what I said. I just remember hanging up, feeling so desperate.",
        "I was accused constantly by my family of becoming so Americanized. But then I would look at myself here, and I would be hanging out with my friends and stuff. And then all of a sudden, I would look at myself and just feel like, gosh, but I\u0027m not like them. I\u0027m not one of them. So I really just kind of felt like I didn\u0027t belong anywhere. And that\u0027s when I slept a lot.",
        "And so one day, I just decided, OK, I\u0027m going to try something else. I want to know what it\u0027s like to not be a violinist. So I put my violin away, and for two weeks, every day for two weeks, I was just living like a non-violinist. I was going to bookstores, looking for-- I don\u0027t know. I was reading, just trying to look for what interests me. I was just like wanting-- I don\u0027t know. I was dwelling on that luxury of being able to choose for myself. But eventually, I really missed it. I really missed the music.",
        "I don\u0027t feel regret. I don\u0027t feel regret that he was there, and that I gave in to this deal. I don\u0027t know if I should say I gave in. But I really don\u0027t regret the fact that he was there that day, listening to me and saying those things, you know, come with me to a new place, a new world, and all that. I don\u0027t think that he was wrong.",
        "Because I have to say, it was just a very adventurous thing to do. And I really feel like if I had a choice to stay home and to do this, I think every time, I would choose it, choose to go.",
        "I think the first thing he said was-- well, the first thing that my aunt translated to us was-- she should come to the States and study with me. Is that possible? Is that possible? Like, would your family allow her to go? Asking my mother this, basically. And I remember my mother just being like, what? What? What? You want what? You know, like she was just utterly confused. And then at the same time, I could see her just like sort of smiling. Like she couldn\u0027t believe her daughter, you know, whatever.",
        "My dad was talking about, you know, maybe we might have to give her up for adoption. I kind of almost remember feeling like, he\u0027s asking me, like, would I be willing to give up my parents and my family for this glamorous life, or whatever? And at the time I didn\u0027t understand. I was like, how can you ask me this question? I don\u0027t want to give up anything.",

        "And I think the movie really promotes racial tension by constantly pitting black against white, having the kids call me \"white bread,\" which never happened. It just, it didn\u0027t happen.",
        "And I said to them, why\u0027d they do that? And they said, well, we found it hard to believe that a classroom of black and Hispanic kids would welcome a white teacher and give her any respect. And I said, but it\u0027s not a matter of your skin color, it\u0027s a matter of how you treat them. But they couldn\u0027t believe that. And they still don\u0027t. And I think there are a lot of people who do believe that you can\u0027t walk into a classroom filled with minority kids and they\u0027re going to treat you right.",
        "And when I got that in the mail, I opened it up. And it said Dangerous Minds.",
        "Yeah. It said Dangerous Minds, and it had the movie poster on it. And it said by LuAnne Johnson. And I thought, well, I didn\u0027t write a book called Dangerous Minds. How can they do this? So I called my editor, and I said, \"How can you do this? How can you change the title of my book without even telling me?\" And she said, \"It\u0027s not your book. It\u0027s our book. You wrote it. We bought it. We own it.\"",
        "Someone called me and said, did you hear? I heard they\u0027re making a TV show out of your book. And I said, oh really? Oh, that\u0027s interesting. So I called my agent in Los Angeles and said, \"They\u0027re making a TV series? I would like to consult, because I don\u0027t want them to do what they did with the movie, get so far removed from reality. I\u0027d really like to have something to do this time.\"",
        "So she called back later and said, \"No, they said they don\u0027t need you. They don\u0027t want you. They can\u0027t afford you.\" And I said, \"What do you mean? I know I\u0027m a lot cheaper than those Hollywood people.\" So, call them back.",
        "No, that\u0027s one of the reasons I wrote that book, is I felt like people were just writing off kids. You know, 13, 14 years old, saying, well, they\u0027re hopeless, they\u0027re useless, and there\u0027s nothing we can do. All the things I was reading were about how horrible they are, and they have no respect for people, and they don\u0027t care, and they\u0027re unteachable. And I just don\u0027t feel that\u0027s true. I think that\u0027s really wrong.",
        "Right. And then there was some discussion between her and them and me. And in fact, I asked one of the producers how much they\u0027re paying the writers. I said, \"I heard you were paying them $50,000 each per episode.\" And he said, \"Oh no, we\u0027re only paying them $30,000 plus perks.\"",
        "A week. And we asked them to pay $25,000 for a year. And they said, \"Well, we\u0027ll see. Probably not.\"",
        "So I called the producer, Andy Schneider, and I said, \"Andy, I\u0027m very upset about this.\" He said, \"Well, what\u0027s your problem?\" And I said, \"Where do I start? Would you like if your 14-year-old or 15-year-old daughter came home from school and you found out her teacher had taken her to a strip club?\" And he didn\u0027t answer that.",
        "They did the hair war to raise funds because Ms. Johnson had a fight with a school board member who it turns out is taking money away from the program. For a teacher to involve kids in a political fight like that among the adults is inappropriate. It\u0027s just not professional behavior. And I wouldn\u0027t do such a thing. It\u0027s undignified, and it\u0027s silly. And he said, \"Well, I think it\u0027s cute.\" And I said, \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what, I\u0027m not cute, and my students don\u0027t think I am.\"",
        "The primary lesson I always try to teach my students is you choose who you are. You can throw up your hands and blame everyone in the world and say, I can\u0027t earn an A, I can\u0027t do this, I have to do that. You don\u0027t have to do anything. You don\u0027t have to come to school. You choose to be here. Now you can choose to learn, or you can choose to vegetate. I think that came across in the movie, that there is hope, that you\u0027re not a victim.",
        "And I said, this is so wrong. There are black males who aren\u0027t trying to kill people. Why do you have to constantly present them as violent? They can drop out of school even and still not be a criminal.",
        "And I really resent that, because nobody ever threatened me. You know, this is totally unrealistic to think that some black girl\u0027s boyfriend\u0027s going to come and shoot the teacher because she\u0027s trying to tell the girl to go to college.",
        "Then, one of the things I said to them, and I probably offended them, but I said, \"I\u0027m not trying to offend you, but I really believe that one of the problems that the script writers are having with presenting black and Hispanic males accurately is that you don\u0027t know any who you haven\u0027t mowed your lawn or served your food. You\u0027ve never been to their houses.\"",
        "Ooh, that it\u0027s a war zone.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. It\u0027s not a new story. It\u0027s the same old story, which isn\u0027t true and never has been.",
        "Disney somehow seems to believe that they own LuAnne Johnson the way that they own Mickey Mouse and Dumbo and that they can take this character and make her do what they want and say anything-- you know, whatever experiences they want to have her do. I maintain I\u0027m not a character. And I don\u0027t think you should be able to have me say things or do things that I wouldn\u0027t do and misrepresent me."

As soon as I got in the water, I got this weird, tingly feeling. The shadows from the candles loomed around me like ghosts, and the water looked like blood.",
        "I sat there naked and shivering by the wood stove and prayed out loud for God to send me things I associated with red. I asked for sex, adventure, and central heat. I also asked for red cowboy boots and a ruby ring. On Monday morning, I drove to Culpepper and found the cowboy boots for $2 at the Pink Ladies Shop and the ring in a jar of buttons which they let me have for $0.25. That night, the awful man from the flea market drove out to see me and spent the night.",
        "I realized my next wishes would have to be more specific. Tuesday evening, I repeated the ritual, except the water turned blue. I found it a harder color to match with things I needed, so I just asked for general good fortune. Nothing special happened Wednesday, but nothing went wrong either.",
        "Well, it went on like that for the next 14 days. My luck began to turn. I found better clothes in the thrift shops than I\u0027d ever found before, and made over $100 at the flea market. My landlord began to smile and wave at me when I drove past his house, and letters with small checks in them arrived at the post office. But I guess I have to get to the unbelievable part, and here\u0027s what it is. A handsome young millionaire came up to me the last day of the baths and offered me free rent in a sunny slum apartment, and $10,000 to start my own business. Sounds like a lie, doesn\u0027t it? I know it does, but it\u0027s true.",
        "Soon after we moved there, he fell in love with me, and we all lived together that winter, sleeping on mattresses on the floor and eating Chinese food out of cardboard containers. That was one of the happiest times in my life, though I missed certain things about living alone in the country. The dark side of the magic hadn\u0027t revealed itself yet, so we blithely enjoyed our warm rooms, and I thanked Jesus every night for his blessings.",
        "I\u0027ve heard that we punish ourselves better and more profoundly than any spirits or gods we can imagine. I hope that\u0027s true. I hope that\u0027s true because I still feel guilty. Because, you see, David, the millionaire, was married, and I knew it from the very beginning. He invited me to Washington, DC to have dinner with him and his wife.",
        "I remember everything about that night. I wore an antique dress, platform shoes, and three carved Bakelite bracelets. My entire outfit cost less than $10. His wife had a mink coat, and long, red fingernails. I was very impressed with them both. They\u0027d invited me to drive from my little house in Virginia to discuss a business deal. He was a slum landlord. She had an antique clothing store. They had discovered me selling things at the Georgetown flea market and wanted me to trade clothes for a three-room apartment in a tenement across town. It seemed like a good idea to me at the time.",
        "So I took the place. But things didn\u0027t really go as they were intended to. The apartment was cramped and lonely. All the other tenants were on strike because the building was falling down. And David, the owner, wanted me to be his mistress. During this time, my visits to the local Haitian voodoo store became more frequent.",
        "You must understand that living in the ghetto was very different from living in any other part of town. Even the grocery stores sell statues of Santa Barbara, San Lazaro, and the Virgin Mary. And when one of the neighbors was found dead on the front stoop, the Jamaican woman whose son dressed like a ninja and practiced swinging his nunchucks in the hall put holy candles all around the lobby in the order of the seven African powers.",
        "We were the only white family on the block. It was very lonely. My only comfort was sitting in the cool, spooky Catholic church looking at the handmade doll clothes the ladies made for the statues.",
        "When I was nearing my 30th birthday, I decided it was about time to get off welfare. Both the children were in school, and old dreams of being a hippie revolutionary scrounging for a pound of bulgur and soybeans in the mountains didn\u0027t seem nearly as romantic as it had five years before. My husband had run off to the Virgin Islands two winters before with a fat Jewish girl who knew somebody down there who had a boat.",
        "And then, one full moon, I put on my black velvet dress pinned with a rhinestone dagger, wrapped a small box of jinx remover powder in a white handkerchief, and walked across town to the house where David and his wife lived. It was not really clear to me at the time what I was up to. I felt as if I was being guided by an unseen force, but I swear, I had no real idea what I was doing. I took a pine branch and I put it through the mail slot. And then I left this little package on the stoop, said a few magic words, and ran.",
        "The next morning, when David came out to get the paper, he found the stick and the spell. His wife asked him to go buy half and half for their coffee because they were having weekend guests. David says he doesn\u0027t really know why he decided to go to the little tienda by my house, but when he got there, he decided to come see me. Until that moment, neither one of us had felt anything for the other.",
        "When I opened the door, he was standing there crying. He said he loved me and couldn\u0027t live without me. I said the same thing, and he never went back home. His wife sued him for $1 million, all the furniture, and the Mercedes. She won, but I got him. It took me years to figure out how to get away.",
        "It\u0027s true that I loved him for a while, or at least I thought I did. But looking back on it, I realize I had been alone so long that I would have probably thought I was in love with anybody who took care of me. I remember when he bought me this Diana Ross song, \"I Know I\u0027ll Never Love This Way Again.\" I\u0027d play that before he came over and dance around the house and try to get in the mood.",
        "Then my brother was found half-dead of a barbiturate overdose in the woods of West Virginia on a commune, and he came to live with us. Four people in a three-room apartment. One thing led to another, and David took us all under his wing. Michael tried to kill himself two more times. Christmas came and went. David gave me $40 a week and took me out to dinner, which sometimes cost three times that.",
        "I felt like I was El Salvador and David was America. I used to scream and cry and beg him to let me go. One of the neighbors put it into words very well when he carved \"landlord\u0027s whore\" on my front door. I refused to let David have it painted over. It was true. There are only two kinds of frenzy that take all my reason away. One is the frenzy of love, one is the frenzy of needing money. It got to the point where I was in a constant frenzy. I needed a lawyer and a psychiatrist.",
        "My cripple brother moved across the street to another hot slum apartment and lived with a black woman named May. They fought over money, other men, his leaving his clothes on the floor for her to pick up, et cetera. She was very beautiful, like Diana Ross, but she stayed drunk on straight gin and watched soap operas all day. David gave him $200 a week to live on. It was part of our understanding even though we never discussed it.",
        "I knew that my staying with him kept my brother from another suicide attempt. The money gave us all a false sense of security, but the thought of it being taken away haunted us constantly. I was 30 years old. The children were eight and four. My brother was 24. And David was 33 and already a millionaire.",
        "Then one hot night in June, I began to break all the windows in the apartment with my bare hands. I began to scream out the window that this is what happened to a woman when she had to sell her body to pay the rent. David tried to hold me down and cover my mouth, but I broke away and ran down three flights of stairs screaming.",
        "When I got out on the cement steps, he and his brother caught me again. But before they realized what was happening, I ripped my dress in two and stood there naked and yelling, \"Take it, take it. This is all you want. This is what you pay for, my body, not me, just this body.\" His brother slapped me in the face and they drug me naked up the cement stairs, scraping the skin off my back.",
        "I don\u0027t remember too much after that, but nothing really changed. We went on living there. My brother went on living across the street. Two years later, he finally did kill himself by jumping out the window. I kept his remains in the kitchen cabinet for a long time.",
        "But it took me seven years to get rid of David. Ronald Reagan was up for a second term that year, and he was invited to the inaugural ball. David wanted me to go, too. Now, I do know people who would be delighted to go to the inaugural ball just to see what it\u0027s like. But I was so superstitious, I was sure God would strike me dead for hobnobbing with the richest and meanest congregation on Earth.",
        "So I went back to the voodoo lady. She told me what to do. First I had to take an apple and cut out its core. Then I was to write my problem on a piece of paper and put it inside. Then I had to wrap the apple with a black ribbon while I chanted, bind him, bind him, take away his power and set me free. And then, on the first night of the new moon, I buried the apple in the nuns\u0027 graveyard behind the Sacred Heart Church.",
        "The next day, the children and I drove to Cincinnati where an old Hell\u0027s Angel friend of mine ran a tattoo parlor. I got him to put a big red heart and dagger up high on my bicep. I knew no good Republican man would ever want to be seen with me again. And you know what? He didn\u0027t.",
        "The truth is that like any other Third World country that tries to cut itself off from America too quickly, our economy has never recovered. And that\u0027s why tonight by the full moon, I have returned to the bar where we first made our fateful bargain to beg him for enough money to pay the rent. They say that once you start messing with the occult, you\u0027re forever in its debt.",
        "I must have been a sight in those days with my folding tables and clothes racks and raggedy looking children in Georgetown. I think I was pretty then, but I didn\u0027t know it. I wore peasant blouses with no brassiere, and my hair was long and curly and white-blond from the sun.",
        "You must realize that in those days, hippie women were really different from straight women. We thought we were practically another race. We believed in all kinds of dogmas and rhetoric. We believed it, and we lived it. Not eating meat was one of those. Smoking dope was really important. We believed in karma and revolution and a whole lot of obscure practices which sound silly now but made a whole lot of sense back then.",
        "So when a young lawyer or real estate broker or something would come along and hang around too long, I didn\u0027t know what to think. Didn\u0027t they know that we were worlds apart in every way? What could we possibly have to say to each other? I was so naive. When the man who ran the flea market invited me out to dinner at the Steak \u0027n Egg Kitchen, I was flabbergasted. I was, but I went anyway.",
        "By now, it was beginning to get chilly. Money would really be tight when it got too cold to sell on the street, so I decided to go to a fortune teller. She lived and worked in a storefront in Chinatown. She was fat and sneaky-looking and had only one breast. But as it turned out, she was right about everything to come, and she gave me three wishes. I wished for an apartment, a man, and an antique store.",
        "She gave me a strange list of things to buy. They were a bottle of Chinese floor wash, four seven-day candles, red, white, blue, and green, a box of bano sangrados, which means spirit bath, white flowers, jinx remover powder, and Indian money draw soap. I drove back to the country $20 poorer and kind of depressed that I could have been so vulnerable.",
        "That was on a Saturday. On Sunday, I poured the bottle of Chinese floor wash into the bucket of fresh pumped water and scrubbed all the floors in the house with it. This was to clear out evil spirits. Then when the children went to sleep, I began the ritual of the spirit bath. I placed the candles around the galvanized tin tub that we used for everything, filled it with kettles of hot water, and poured in the first bottle of red liquid from the box I bought."

And they said, well, we found it hard to believe that a classroom of black and Hispanic kids would welcome a white teacher and give her any respect. And I said, but it\u0027s not a matter of your skin color, it\u0027s a matter of how you treat them. But they couldn\u0027t believe that. And they still don\u0027t. And I think there are a lot of people who do believe that you can\u0027t walk into a classroom filled with minority kids and they\u0027re going to treat you right.",
            "And when I got that in the mail, I opened it up. And it said Dangerous Minds.",
            "Yeah. It said Dangerous Minds, and it had the movie poster on it. And it said by LuAnne Johnson. And I thought, well, I didn\u0027t write a book called Dangerous Minds. How can they do this? So I called my editor, and I said, \"How can you do this? How can you change the title of my book without even telling me?\" And she said, \"It\u0027s not your book. It\u0027s our book. You wrote it. We bought it. We own it.\"",
            "Someone called me and said, did you hear? I heard they\u0027re making a TV show out of your book. And I said, oh really? Oh, that\u0027s interesting. So I called my agent in Los Angeles and said, \"They\u0027re making a TV series? I would like to consult, because I don\u0027t want them to do what they did with the movie, get so far removed from reality. I\u0027d really like to have something to do this time.\"",
            "So she called back later and said, \"No, they said they don\u0027t need you. They don\u0027t want you. They can\u0027t afford you.\" And I said, \"What do you mean? I know I\u0027m a lot cheaper than those Hollywood people.\" So, call them back.",
            "No, that\u0027s one of the reasons I wrote that book, is I felt like people were just writing off kids. You know, 13, 14 years old, saying, well, they\u0027re hopeless, they\u0027re useless, and there\u0027s nothing we can do. All the things I was reading were about how horrible they are, and they have no respect for people, and they don\u0027t care, and they\u0027re unteachable. And I just don\u0027t feel that\u0027s true. I think that\u0027s really wrong.",
            "Right. And then there was some discussion between her and them and me. And in fact, I asked one of the producers how much they\u0027re paying the writers. I said, \"I heard you were paying them $50,000 each per episode.\" And he said, \"Oh no, we\u0027re only paying them $30,000 plus perks.\"",
            "A week. And we asked them to pay $25,000 for a year. And they said, \"Well, we\u0027ll see. Probably not.\"",
            "So I called the producer, Andy Schneider, and I said, \"Andy, I\u0027m very upset about this.\" He said, \"Well, what\u0027s your problem?\" And I said, \"Where do I start? Would you like if your 14-year-old or 15-year-old daughter came home from school and you found out her teacher had taken her to a strip club?\" And he didn\u0027t answer that.",
            "They did the hair war to raise funds because Ms. Johnson had a fight with a school board member who it turns out is taking money away from the program. For a teacher to involve kids in a political fight like that among the adults is inappropriate. It\u0027s just not professional behavior. And I wouldn\u0027t do such a thing. It\u0027s undignified, and it\u0027s silly. And he said, \"Well, I think it\u0027s cute.\" And I said, \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what, I\u0027m not cute, and my students don\u0027t think I am.\"",
            "The primary lesson I always try to teach my students is you choose who you are. You can throw up your hands and blame everyone in the world and say, I can\u0027t earn an A, I can\u0027t do this, I have to do that. You don\u0027t have to do anything. You don\u0027t have to come to school. You choose to be here. Now you can choose to learn, or you can choose to vegetate. I think that came across in the movie, that there is hope, that you\u0027re not a victim.",
            "And I said, this is so wrong. There are black males who aren\u0027t trying to kill people. Why do you have to constantly present them as violent? They can drop out of school even and still not be a criminal.",
            "And I really resent that, because nobody ever threatened me. You know, this is totally unrealistic to think that some black girl\u0027s boyfriend\u0027s going to come and shoot the teacher because she\u0027s trying to tell the girl to go to college.",
            "Then, one of the things I said to them, and I probably offended them, but I said, \"I\u0027m not trying to offend you, but I really believe that one of the problems that the script writers are having with presenting black and Hispanic males accurately is that you don\u0027t know any who you haven\u0027t mowed your lawn or served your food. You\u0027ve never been to their houses.\"",
            "Ooh, that it\u0027s a war zone.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. It\u0027s not a new story. It\u0027s the same old story, which isn\u0027t true and never has been.",
            "Disney somehow seems to believe that they own LuAnne Johnson the way that they own Mickey Mouse and Dumbo and that they can take this character and make her do what they want and say anything-- you know, whatever experiences they want to have her do. I maintain I\u0027m not a character. And I don\u0027t think you should be able to have me say things or do things that I wouldn\u0027t do and misrepresent me."

            "Act One, Dangerous Minds. First, a word about LuAnne Johnson\u0027s book, the one that they adapted very freely into the movie and the TV show Dangerous Minds. It was called My Posse Don\u0027t Do Homework. LuAnne Johnson taught in the public schools, and she says that contrary to what you may see on the evening news, it was not a war zone.",
            "Around this time, her deal with, well, with Hollywood, let\u0027s just say, with Hollywood took other turns. A new printing of the book My Posse Don\u0027t Do Homework came out.",
            "As the title it said Dangerous Minds?",
            "Not long after that, executives, executives somewhere in America, decided to exercise a clause in an old contract that she had signed, and her deal took this turn.",
            "That\u0027s right. Apparently they haven\u0027t heard about educational salaries in America.",
            "Per episode?",
            "Again, there are things about the TV series that LuAnne Johnson likes. She likes, especially, the feisty, in-your-face way that Annie Potts plays her, for example. But she also finds plenty that makes her uncomfortable. Like that episode where the students stage the fundraiser in the strip club. They hold something called a hair war.",
            "LuAnne Johnson, the real one, not the TV one, is trying to raise millions of dollars to start a new school these days. And having herself portrayed on national television this way every week, she feels, is not going to help her credibility.",
            "Well, LuAnne Johnson\u0027s deal with the devil proceeded in several stages. First the film, which starred Michelle Pfeiffer, came out, I don\u0027t know, two years ago I think, three years ago. And LuAnne Johnson did like some things about the film.",
            "The last scene of the hair war episode has LuAnne Johnson on stage in a strip club modelling a big outrageous hairdo as her students cheer. If LuAnne Johnson made a deal with the devil, it was a devil whose intentions, anyway, seemed particularly benign and well meaning.",
            "The producers of Dangerous Minds are Andy Schneider and Diane Frolov. Before this project, they produced the offbeat program Northern Exposure for five years. They\u0027ve worked together so closely for so long that they habitually finish each other\u0027s sentences. And if you ask them what they\u0027re trying to accomplish in Dangerous Minds, the goals sound remarkably similar to the ones that LuAnne Johnson had in mind when she wrote her books.",
            "Though the producers do not have a lot of personal experience with these kinds of teenagers, they say they get their storylines from consultants who work with teens like this-- teachers, social workers, a youth gang services counselor. They read books. They got the idea for the hair wars show from a story about hair wars in the Wall Street Journal. And they described LuAnne Johnson\u0027s phone call to them about the episode this way.",
            "The real LuAnne Johnson also had problems with a scene in an early program where a black character threatens to kill the TV Ms. Johnson because she\u0027s encouraging his girlfriend to go to college.",
            "Producers Andy Schneider and Diane Frolov say that, although LuAnne Johnson herself was never threatened, other teachers in her situation certainly have been. And while they don\u0027t recall talking to LuAnne Johnson about this particular episode of the show, they don\u0027t view the scene the same way she does.",
            "What do you think the overall message of the TV series is?",
            "So the overall message of the TV show is, in fact, the exact opposite of the kind of thing you\u0027re trying to convey with your books?",
            "In a sense, this is the Faustian bargain the producers of Dangerous Minds have made. The high school in their show has more war zone moments, more heroic attempts by teachers to save kids, more crises and near crises than any real inner city high school, because they need three stories per episode, and they have to be dramatic.",
            "At this point, LuAnne Johnson says that she\u0027s refusing the Faustian bargain offered her by Hollywood. She has no contract with the TV series. They send her checks. She sends them back uncashed. She says if she had it all to do over again, she wouldn\u0027t have let anybody make a film or a TV series from her books unless she\u0027d written the screenplay herself. And she\u0027s hoping the studio that produces Dangerous Minds, it\u0027s Disney, will change the way that it depicts her.",
            "Of course, as the producers of Dangerous Minds point out, Disney does own a Mickey Mouse and a Dumbo and a LuAnne Johnson. They can make this character do what they want. And given the deals everyone has made, they have to.",
            "But the movie took some liberties with LuAnne Johnson\u0027s book. For instance, the filmmakers made her mixed race class into an all minority class. The filmmakers invented fictional black parents who did not want their kids to learn. The filmmakers organized the film around two stories which did not happen in real life. In one, LuAnne Johnson gets so overwhelmed by how impossible it is to make progress with her kids that after just a few months, she decides to quit. And in the other, a student is shot and killed. And she feels that these things reinforce the very stereotypes that she was trying to dispel by writing her book in the first place."

            "Classical music, like ballet or gymnastics, is a discipline with a torrentious aesthetic. The greater the sacrifice, the bigger the hero. And to Peabody, a second-rate music school in a second-rate town, Jayna\u0027s sacrifice and talent were Olympian. We were all awed. No one so young played so well.",
            "Jayna moved in with a host family, the Kilsteads. Carla Kilstead, another Senofsky student, was about the same age as Jayna and I. We would all hang out together, play Space Invaders in the Peabody lounge and beg money off our moms for the candy machines.",
            "Then I remember you being in the car with my mom, and me, and Carla.",
            "This was the first time ever. And I remember we were driving past the Inner Harbor, and there was a ship.",
            "Jayna says the first couple of years in America were everything she wanted them to be. Everything was new. Everything was interesting. Her life with her host family was good. She did well in competitions, and Senofsky got his manager to set up some concerts for her in Holland. Then, after two years of study at Peabody, Jayna went back to Korea for the first time. And when she came back to America, things started to fall apart. Her relationship with her host family deteriorated.",
            "She left that host family and moved in with another and then left them for another. More was expected of Jayna than of any of us, and she was essentially raising herself. She was lonely and started to miss her family in Korea. At one point, she called her mom.",
            "Jayna and I meet in the courtyard of the Peabody Conservatory of Music, then walk down the street to Louis\u0027s Bookstore Cafe. When we were teenagers, Jayna and I would go to Louis\u0027s between orchestra and violin lessons. We\u0027d eat fish sandwiches, talk about music, and gawk at the art boys.",
            "I remember Jayna during this part of her life. I remember driving her back from orchestra rehearsal and sitting with her in my car outside her house. I was 16 and she was 14. I remember her telling me about the problems in her family back home in Korea. Her father was having financial difficulties. Her brother was having trouble getting into the right college, which in Korea determines your whole future. And her sister had had some kind of breakdown and had been put into a mental institution.",
            "It was all very draining, and Jayna was having a hard time. But what I remember best was that these crises somehow forced Jayna to think about her decision to come to America in a new way. Watching her family struggle from a distance somehow brought her face to face with her own distance from them and from her culture. I remember her telling me that she felt she could never go back to Korea, that she had missed too much.",
            "In the world of classical music, if you don\u0027t make it as a soloist by the time you\u0027re 16 or 17, odds are you\u0027re never going to make it. At 20, it hadn\u0027t happened for Jayna. She was still practicing and competing, but it was more of a struggle.",
            "Someone recently wrote that the tragedy of Bob Dole is not only that he sold out his principles and sold out everything he ever believed in to become president, this deficit hawk who campaigned on the kind of tax cut he used to ridicule as voodoo economics, but that after he sold out his principles and his soul, he discovered that there were no buyers.",
            "Jayna\u0027s story reminds me of that. She agrees that yes, she made a Faustian bargain. She left her family, left her country, left her home. But she never got the fame and fortune she made all those sacrifices for. And when I talked to her, I somehow expected her to be as conflicted about it as she was when we were in my car at 16. But in fact, she was fine with it. Her feelings have changed, and she\u0027s outgrown the premise of the bargain. She doesn\u0027t particularly want to be a soloist, and she\u0027s not driven for fame.",
            "With or without violin, Jayna clearly prefers life in America to the restricted life she would have had in Korea. And though recently her parents have started talking about coming to the States, moving in with her so that they can be closer, she finds these conversations make her nervous. She doesn\u0027t want to give up the independence she\u0027s had since she was 11.",
            "Jayna is Korean. When Jayna was 11, Jayna, her mother, her violin teacher, and her aunt, all drove four hours from the small town where she grew up to Seoul, South Korea\u0027s capital. They went to a big hotel, the hotel where all the Korean celebrities and international tourists stayed, and went to the room of violinist Berl Senofsky. She played him the Mendelssohn violin concerto.",
            "Jayna\u0027s now 23. She\u0027s still at Peabody. She gigs with the Lyric Opera Orchestra and Young Concert Artists\u0027 Orchestra in Baltimore. She has a sponsor, a businessman in North Carolina who heard her perform and now helps her with a monthly check. At her apartment, after playing three songs for me, Jayna stops and is about to put her violin away. She asks, should I keep playing? And I say, sure, play more. No, she says, I mean the violin. Jayna\u0027s still wondering.",
            "No one in Jayna\u0027s family really knew what she\u0027d be getting into if she accepted Senofsky\u0027s offer to go to America. But it was clear from the beginning that if Jayna went, she would go alone.",
            "Later, at Jayna\u0027s house, she brings out the violin. I ask her to play me the Mendelssohn, the song that she played for Mr. Senofsky, the song that literally divided her life into past and present. The opening melody is famous for being hard to play.",
            "I remember the first time I saw Jayna. She was short and chubby, and dressed in a red Korean coat. Immediately after coming to America, Jayna dropped about 20 pounds. I remember people whispering that she was chubby when she arrived because meals were the only time that Jayna\u0027s strict Korean mother would allow her to stop practicing. There were other rumors, all part of the Jayna mystique, the young Korean prodigy who had sacrificed so much, come alone from Korea to study in Baltimore."

            "I don\u0027t know what it was, but I think like around the third year, or something like that that I was living with them, I really started to feel like my presence there was a burden to them, you know? And that\u0027s when it started getting hard, because then I realized, oh my gosh, what am I doing? I\u0027ve been here, I\u0027ve been living with a family that\u0027s not mine, basically strangers. What can they possibly like about this?",
            "Well, I was really upset. So I called and I was crying, and I said, you know, can I just come back and just go back to school there? At least let me try that and see if that works. And I was really hoping, if not assuming, that my mother would just say, sure, come back, you know?",
            "She said, that\u0027s ridiculous. You\u0027ve been there for so long now, and now you have to carry on what you\u0027ve been doing. And I just remember hanging up. I don\u0027t remember exactly what I said. I just remember hanging up, feeling so desperate.",
            "I was accused constantly by my family of becoming so Americanized. But then I would look at myself here, and I would be hanging out with my friends and stuff. And then all of a sudden, I would look at myself and just feel like, gosh, but I\u0027m not like them. I\u0027m not one of them. So I really just kind of felt like I didn\u0027t belong anywhere. And that\u0027s when I slept a lot.",
            "And so one day, I just decided, OK, I\u0027m going to try something else. I want to know what it\u0027s like to not be a violinist. So I put my violin away, and for two weeks, every day for two weeks, I was just living like a non-violinist. I was going to bookstores, looking for-- I don\u0027t know. I was reading, just trying to look for what interests me. I was just like wanting-- I don\u0027t know. I was dwelling on that luxury of being able to choose for myself. But eventually, I really missed it. I really missed the music.",
            "I don\u0027t feel regret. I don\u0027t feel regret that he was there, and that I gave in to this deal. I don\u0027t know if I should say I gave in. But I really don\u0027t regret the fact that he was there that day, listening to me and saying those things, you know, come with me to a new place, a new world, and all that. I don\u0027t think that he was wrong.",
            "Because I have to say, it was just a very adventurous thing to do. And I really feel like if I had a choice to stay home and to do this, I think every time, I would choose it, choose to go.",
            "I think the first thing he said was-- well, the first thing that my aunt translated to us was-- she should come to the States and study with me. Is that possible? Is that possible? Like, would your family allow her to go? Asking my mother this, basically. And I remember my mother just being like, what? What? What? You want what? You know, like she was just utterly confused. And then at the same time, I could see her just like sort of smiling. Like she couldn\u0027t believe her daughter, you know, whatever.",
            "My dad was talking about, you know, maybe we might have to give her up for adoption. I kind of almost remember feeling like, he\u0027s asking me, like, would I be willing to give up my parents and my family for this glamorous life, or whatever? And at the time I didn\u0027t understand. I was like, how can you ask me this question? I don\u0027t want to give up anything.",

            "Just before I got in the tub, I arranged the white roses in front of my dead mother\u0027s picture. This was to ensure her blessing and ask her to intervene on my behalf. As soon as I got in the water, I got this weird, tingly feeling. The shadows from the candles loomed around me like ghosts, and the water looked like blood.",
            "I sat there naked and shivering by the wood stove and prayed out loud for God to send me things I associated with red. I asked for sex, adventure, and central heat. I also asked for red cowboy boots and a ruby ring. On Monday morning, I drove to Culpepper and found the cowboy boots for $2 at the Pink Ladies Shop and the ring in a jar of buttons which they let me have for $0.25. That night, the awful man from the flea market drove out to see me and spent the night.",
            "I realized my next wishes would have to be more specific. Tuesday evening, I repeated the ritual, except the water turned blue. I found it a harder color to match with things I needed, so I just asked for general good fortune. Nothing special happened Wednesday, but nothing went wrong either.",
            "Well, it went on like that for the next 14 days. My luck began to turn. I found better clothes in the thrift shops than I\u0027d ever found before, and made over $100 at the flea market. My landlord began to smile and wave at me when I drove past his house, and letters with small checks in them arrived at the post office. But I guess I have to get to the unbelievable part, and here\u0027s what it is. A handsome young millionaire came up to me the last day of the baths and offered me free rent in a sunny slum apartment, and $10,000 to start my own business. Sounds like a lie, doesn\u0027t it? I know it does, but it\u0027s true.",
            "Soon after we moved there, he fell in love with me, and we all lived together that winter, sleeping on mattresses on the floor and eating Chinese food out of cardboard containers. That was one of the happiest times in my life, though I missed certain things about living alone in the country. The dark side of the magic hadn\u0027t revealed itself yet, so we blithely enjoyed our warm rooms, and I thanked Jesus every night for his blessings.",
            "I\u0027ve heard that we punish ourselves better and more profoundly than any spirits or gods we can imagine. I hope that\u0027s true. I hope that\u0027s true because I still feel guilty. Because, you see, David, the millionaire, was married, and I knew it from the very beginning. He invited me to Washington, DC to have dinner with him and his wife.",
            "I remember everything about that night. I wore an antique dress, platform shoes, and three carved Bakelite bracelets. My entire outfit cost less than $10. His wife had a mink coat, and long, red fingernails. I was very impressed with them both. They\u0027d invited me to drive from my little house in Virginia to discuss a business deal. He was a slum landlord. She had an antique clothing store. They had discovered me selling things at the Georgetown flea market and wanted me to trade clothes for a three-room apartment in a tenement across town. It seemed like a good idea to me at the time.",
            "So I took the place. But things didn\u0027t really go as they were intended to. The apartment was cramped and lonely. All the other tenants were on strike because the building was falling down. And David, the owner, wanted me to be his mistress. During this time, my visits to the local Haitian voodoo store became more frequent.",
            "You must understand that living in the ghetto was very different from living in any other part of town. Even the grocery stores sell statues of Santa Barbara, San Lazaro, and the Virgin Mary. And when one of the neighbors was found dead on the front stoop, the Jamaican woman whose son dressed like a ninja and practiced swinging his nunchucks in the hall put holy candles all around the lobby in the order of the seven African powers.",
            "We were the only white family on the block. It was very lonely. My only comfort was sitting in the cool, spooky Catholic church looking at the handmade doll clothes the ladies made for the statues.",
            "When I was nearing my 30th birthday, I decided it was about time to get off welfare. Both the children were in school, and old dreams of being a hippie revolutionary scrounging for a pound of bulgur and soybeans in the mountains didn\u0027t seem nearly as romantic as it had five years before. My husband had run off to the Virgin Islands two winters before with a fat Jewish girl who knew somebody down there who had a boat.",
            "And then, one full moon, I put on my black velvet dress pinned with a rhinestone dagger, wrapped a small box of jinx remover powder in a white handkerchief, and walked across town to the house where David and his wife lived. It was not really clear to me at the time what I was up to. I felt as if I was being guided by an unseen force, but I swear, I had no real idea what I was doing. I took a pine branch and I put it through the mail slot. And then I left this little package on the stoop, said a few magic words, and ran.",
            "The next morning, when David came out to get the paper, he found the stick and the spell. His wife asked him to go buy half and half for their coffee because they were having weekend guests. David says he doesn\u0027t really know why he decided to go to the little tienda by my house, but when he got there, he decided to come see me. Until that moment, neither one of us had felt anything for the other.",
            "When I opened the door, he was standing there crying. He said he loved me and couldn\u0027t live without me. I said the same thing, and he never went back home. His wife sued him for $1 million, all the furniture, and the Mercedes. She won, but I got him. It took me years to figure out how to get away.",
            "It\u0027s true that I loved him for a while, or at least I thought I did. But looking back on it, I realize I had been alone so long that I would have probably thought I was in love with anybody who took care of me. I remember when he bought me this Diana Ross song, \"I Know I\u0027ll Never Love This Way Again.\" I\u0027d play that before he came over and dance around the house and try to get in the mood.",
            "Then my brother was found half-dead of a barbiturate overdose in the woods of West Virginia on a commune, and he came to live with us. Four people in a three-room apartment. One thing led to another, and David took us all under his wing. Michael tried to kill himself two more times. Christmas came and went. David gave me $40 a week and took me out to dinner, which sometimes cost three times that.",
            "I felt like I was El Salvador and David was America. I used to scream and cry and beg him to let me go. One of the neighbors put it into words very well when he carved \"landlord\u0027s whore\" on my front door. I refused to let David have it painted over. It was true. There are only two kinds of frenzy that take all my reason away. One is the frenzy of love, one is the frenzy of needing money. It got to the point where I was in a constant frenzy. I needed a lawyer and a psychiatrist.",
            "My cripple brother moved across the street to another hot slum apartment and lived with a black woman named May. They fought over money, other men, his leaving his clothes on the floor for her to pick up, et cetera. She was very beautiful, like Diana Ross, but she stayed drunk on straight gin and watched soap operas all day. David gave him $200 a week to live on. It was part of our understanding even though we never discussed it.",
            "I knew that my staying with him kept my brother from another suicide attempt. The money gave us all a false sense of security, but the thought of it being taken away haunted us constantly. I was 30 years old. The children were eight and four. My brother was 24. And David was 33 and already a millionaire.",
            "Then one hot night in June, I began to break all the windows in the apartment with my bare hands. I began to scream out the window that this is what happened to a woman when she had to sell her body to pay the rent. David tried to hold me down and cover my mouth, but I broke away and ran down three flights of stairs screaming.",
            "When I got out on the cement steps, he and his brother caught me again. But before they realized what was happening, I ripped my dress in two and stood there naked and yelling, \"Take it, take it. This is all you want. This is what you pay for, my body, not me, just this body.\" His brother slapped me in the face and they drug me naked up the cement stairs, scraping the skin off my back.",
            "I don\u0027t remember too much after that, but nothing really changed. We went on living there. My brother went on living across the street. Two years later, he finally did kill himself by jumping out the window. I kept his remains in the kitchen cabinet for a long time.",
            "But it took me seven years to get rid of David. Ronald Reagan was up for a second term that year, and he was invited to the inaugural ball. David wanted me to go, too. Now, I do know people who would be delighted to go to the inaugural ball just to see what it\u0027s like. But I was so superstitious, I was sure God would strike me dead for hobnobbing with the richest and meanest congregation on Earth.",
            "So I went back to the voodoo lady. She told me what to do. First I had to take an apple and cut out its core. Then I was to write my problem on a piece of paper and put it inside. Then I had to wrap the apple with a black ribbon while I chanted, bind him, bind him, take away his power and set me free. And then, on the first night of the new moon, I buried the apple in the nuns\u0027 graveyard behind the Sacred Heart Church.",
            "The next day, the children and I drove to Cincinnati where an old Hell\u0027s Angel friend of mine ran a tattoo parlor. I got him to put a big red heart and dagger up high on my bicep. I knew no good Republican man would ever want to be seen with me again. And you know what? He didn\u0027t.",
            "The truth is that like any other Third World country that tries to cut itself off from America too quickly, our economy has never recovered. And that\u0027s why tonight by the full moon, I have returned to the bar where we first made our fateful bargain to beg him for enough money to pay the rent. They say that once you start messing with the occult, you\u0027re forever in its debt.",
            "I must have been a sight in those days with my folding tables and clothes racks and raggedy looking children in Georgetown. I think I was pretty then, but I didn\u0027t know it. I wore peasant blouses with no brassiere, and my hair was long and curly and white-blond from the sun.",
            "You must realize that in those days, hippie women were really different from straight women. We thought we were practically another race. We believed in all kinds of dogmas and rhetoric. We believed it, and we lived it. Not eating meat was one of those. Smoking dope was really important. We believed in karma and revolution and a whole lot of obscure practices which sound silly now but made a whole lot of sense back then.",
            "So when a young lawyer or real estate broker or something would come along and hang around too long, I didn\u0027t know what to think. Didn\u0027t they know that we were worlds apart in every way? What could we possibly have to say to each other? I was so naive. When the man who ran the flea market invited me out to dinner at the Steak \u0027n Egg Kitchen, I was flabbergasted. I was, but I went anyway.",
            "By now, it was beginning to get chilly. Money would really be tight when it got too cold to sell on the street, so I decided to go to a fortune teller. She lived and worked in a storefront in Chinatown. She was fat and sneaky-looking and had only one breast. But as it turned out, she was right about everything to come, and she gave me three wishes. I wished for an apartment, a man, and an antique store.",
            "She gave me a strange list of things to buy. They were a bottle of Chinese floor wash, four seven-day candles, red, white, blue, and green, a box of bano sangrados, which means spirit bath, white flowers, jinx remover powder, and Indian money draw soap. I drove back to the country $20 poorer and kind of depressed that I could have been so vulnerable.",
            "That was on a Saturday. On Sunday, I poured the bottle of Chinese floor wash into the bucket of fresh pumped water and scrubbed all the floors in the house with it. This was to clear out evil spirits. Then when the children went to sleep, I began the ritual of the spirit bath. I placed the candles around the galvanized tin tub that we used for everything, filled it with kettles of hot water, and poured in the first bottle of red liquid from the box I bought."

My landlord began to smile and wave at me when I drove past his house, and letters with small checks in them arrived at the post office. But I guess I have to get to the unbelievable part, and here\u0027s what it is. A handsome young millionaire came up to me the last day of the baths and offered me free rent in a sunny slum apartment, and $10,000 to start my own business. Sounds like a lie, doesn\u0027t it?
