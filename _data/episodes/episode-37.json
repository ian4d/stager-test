I realized that every week as I come to grips with the fact of having to actually do the show, I go through the five stages that Elizabeth Kubler Ross says you go through to come to grips with death. Do you remember the stages? Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. That was the first thing I realized."

The victim must be a white male, a young adult no older than 30, heavyset with dark hair and eyes and the like. The victim must be chosen at random, before sunset, from a public place. The victim is followed home and must put up a struggle, et cetera. Kevin Howard does not let any of this interfere with his work. He is, in fact, our fastest typist. He types as if he were on fire. In any case, when Kevin Howard gets caught, act surprised. Say that he seemed like a nice person, a bit of a loner perhaps, but always quiet and polite."

And I told them myself, I said, \"I am absolutely afraid,\" which I was. \"I\u0027m afraid to load ammunition.\" \"You step over there then.\" Then they called another one, and I think he told them the same thing. \"You step over there.\" And when the end of the day was over, I think just about all of us had stepped over there.",

Every time I would bring it up or even think about it, it looked like I got a hateful feeling in me. And it would just about tear me apart. I just hated the other race. And the hate was building up. It stayed with me. The hate stayed with me. Hate can really destroy a person. I could\u0027ve been a better father, I believe, if I hadn\u0027t had that hate. I wouldn\u0027t abuse them or anything, but there were just things that I didn\u0027t talk about, things I held in, things I think I could have done better.",

        "And this would almost give you a heart attack. Yeah, you would almost have a heart attack. And so we used to ask them sometimes, say, \"Is there any danger of this ammunition exploding?\" They\u0027d say, \"Oh no, don\u0027t worry about it. It\u0027s safe. It\u0027s not live.\" They said they don\u0027t have any detonators in them.",
        "Well, the white officers, they didn\u0027t have much to do with us anymore. And to stand around and supervise and see that we loaded that ammunition.",
        "That was a shocking thing to see those ships torn up and seeing-- I was standing watch over all those dead bodies. I had to stand watch over that. That was my duty, and you couldn\u0027t tell one from the others.",
        "We felt like just we were getting a raw deal because we were the ones that were doing the dirty work. We were the ones that were fooling with the ammunition. So why shouldn\u0027t we have a leave of absence to get away to get your nerves settled. But that didn\u0027t happen.",
        "He told us-- he said \"Well, one thing I want to tell you is that you could be charged with mutiny if you don\u0027t go back to work.\"",
        "It was the cue. When he said you could be shot, then the fellows went to mumbling. You know, a lot of people are afraid to die.",
        "But then 50 of us decided we weren\u0027t going to go back to work. If we were going to get shot, they just had to shoot us because we weren\u0027t going to go back and load anymore ammunition.",
        "We didn\u0027t commit any mutiny. We didn\u0027t take over any ship. We didn\u0027t take over a base. We had no weapons. We didn\u0027t even have a pen. We only refused to go back to work. Now how could that be mutiny?",
        "Well, the mutiny trial-- it\u0027s just like a thing that is cut and dry. We were all sitting over here. All the white officers were over here. We weren\u0027t allowed to say anything but what they would ask us.",
        "The lowest sentence in there, I think, was eight years. I had 12 years. And some had 16.",
        "I used to not be able to talk about it because it would hurt. It would hurt inside. You didn\u0027t want your friends to know that you was in the service, and you had been charged with mutiny. You didn\u0027t want people to think that you didn\u0027t like your country or something, that you\u0027d do something like that. They\u0027re still in this country we knew about.",
        "We can think of ourselves as a hero because we stood up for our rights. We stood up because we knew that we did not commit mutiny.",
        "Long ways back. It doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s been 50 years, and it still hangs over us at 50 years.",
        "You\u0027d be down in the hold. Here come those big bombs and things coming down the ramp-way they had built. But sometimes, they let it come down too fast. And they hit together, and they made a loud noise."

        "But then, I realized that he\u0027s really asking me to take his test, just like I\u0027m asking him to take mine. I come into his house, I ask him very personal questions, and I expect him to answer honestly. And why should he? So I say, \"OK, go ahead.\" And he puts the crystal up to his eye, turns it clockwise and counterclockwise, back and forth, squinting, looking me up and down. And he says, \"I can\u0027t tell for sure. I\u0027m going to have to read your mind. Here, take my hand.\"",
        "He holds out his right hand with the crystal resting in the palm. I take his hand, and he puts his left hand over mine and squeezes it tight and shakes it and goes into a small spasm. The he lets go, and sits back like he\u0027s exhausted. He asks me if I felt anything, and I say, \"Maybe a little.\" And he says, \"I sent you a message. I put it in your mind. I told you what is wrong with me.\"",
        "I\u0027m not supposed to figure out what\u0027s wrong with these people. I\u0027m just supposed to ask the questions and score the answers from one to seven. This is partly because I\u0027m not a doctor and might get something going that I wouldn\u0027t know how to contain. But it\u0027s mainly because my supervisors want clean data. They want all the people asking the questions to be doing it in the same way. I\u0027m not supposed to get emotional. I\u0027m not supposed to let the patient get emotional. The therapy part of the county mental health system is in another department. I wouldn\u0027t even know what number to call, and I\u0027ve been told more than once not to worry about it. I should never have let him take the crystal out of his pouch.",
        "I drove around all day trying to find a Navajo man. He lives very close to the Four Corners, the cross where Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona meet. It\u0027s all dirt roads, a house every five miles or so, no addresses, no phones. I stop at every house and knock on the door, but either nobody\u0027s home, or nobody will answer. I flag down every car that passes and ask directions, and the people offer complicated directions that I follow as best as possible, sometimes driving for 20 or 30 miles. But it\u0027s always the wrong place, or nobody\u0027s home, or there just isn\u0027t a house there at all.",
        "Driving around, I think about how I have some of the same problems as the people I interview. I\u0027m angry, depressed, prone to paranoid delusions, and I worry a lot. Up to now, I thought these were common problems, and that I was more or less able to control them. But now, I don\u0027t know. I feel like I\u0027m just faking it. Eventually, late in the afternoon, I find the man, or at least I think he\u0027s the man. I\u0027m a third of the way through the test before I realize he\u0027s not the right guy.",
        "\"When was your last visit to a mental health clinic?\" \"I don\u0027t go to the clinic.\" \"When did you last see a doctor?\" \"I don\u0027t have a doctor.\" \"Do you blame yourself for anything you\u0027ve done or not done?\" \"No.\" \"Have you felt more self-confident than usual?\" \"No.\" \"Have you heard voices or other things that weren\u0027t there, or that other people couldn\u0027t hear, or have seen things that weren\u0027t there?\" And he says, \"I think you want to talk to my son.\" And I ask him what his son\u0027s name is, and he says, \"Same as mine.\"",
        "I come back the next morning and interview the son in the kitchen. They make coffee for me on a propane camp stove as the house has no electricity. The son is 19 years old, a good looking kid, tall, healthy, says he used to run cross country in high school. He seems to be fine, but as I go through the questions, he starts to fix his eyes on mine, a direct, almost hypnotic stare straight into my head like he\u0027s trying to pull me in and trap me. I try to look back, to look just as deeply into his mind, but it\u0027s like looking into a cave.",
        "He says he hears voices, satanic voices, and that he worries a lot about his shoes, that they\u0027re not the right kind, not the kind he sees on MTV. I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s sick, or if he\u0027s just trying to torture me. And I drive away thinking, I don\u0027t know anything about this disease, that I know even less than when I started. I spent two days driving around and I made $30. And I feel really, really, tired.",
        "The house is dark as all the windows have heavy curtains pulled nearly shut. The curtains over the big picture window in the living room are open just a bit, and the light cuts through like a laser beam and hits the red, shag carpet, throwing up small dust particles and cigarette ash. Two feet away from the light, near the television, is a slice of pizza lying upside down in the carpet. I\u0027m interviewing a woman, a mother, and her teenage daughter is on the phone talking to her boyfriend, or rather a series of boyfriends who call and call, and all of them wanted to go out right now, but her mother won\u0027t let her. She\u0027s trying to answer my questions, trying to concentrate and be polite, but she\u0027s mainly listening to what her daughter is saying on the phone. And will suddenly switch from saying, \"No, no, I\u0027ve been feeling fine. I haven\u0027t had a relapse and months,\" to screaming out, \"Is that John? I told you never to talk to him again.\" Or, \"Who is it? Is it a boy? You can\u0027t go out. Tell him he has to come over here.\"",
        "I can\u0027t stop looking at the slice of pizza on the carpet. I keep looking at the slice of pizza because it\u0027s the only clue that the woman is sick. I mean she has a teenage daughter and a dirty house, and maybe she shouldn\u0027t try to wear her makeup to bed, but these are not necessarily symptoms of schizophrenia. She seems to be fine, just worn out, until I get to the question, \"Have you been worrying a lot?\" And she says yes she has. She\u0027s been worrying a lot that the elders of the Church, the Mormon Church, will take her daughter away from her.",
        "I was hired to interview men and women in the state of Utah who receive Medicaid support for treatment of mental illnesses generally diagnosed as schizophrenia.",
        "And I ask her why, and she says because she stopped taking her medication. And I ask her, \"Why did you stop taking your medication?\" And she says that the only reason she takes it is because she told her bishop that she was visited by the archangel Gabriel, and that she had had sex with him. And then, she was also visited by the archangel Michael, and that she had sex with both of them at once. And that they\u0027d ravished her almost every night. So her bishop made her go to a doctor, and the doctor gave her some pills. And she took the pills, and the angels stopped coming. The bishop and the elders had told her that if she had sex with any more angels, they\u0027d take her daughter away. So I asked her again why she\u0027d stopped taking her medication. And she says, \"I\u0027m lonely. I miss them. I want them to come back.\"",
        "Today in a restaurant eating lunch between interviews, I decided to take the test. I answered the questions and scored myself appropriately, and at some point I realized I wasn\u0027t doing so well. I decided not to even add up the points because then I\u0027d be left with a score, and I\u0027d never forget it. If I were to write a report on myself, it would sound something like this.",
        "\"The patient is 36 years old and lives alone since his wife left him three weeks ago. She took the kids and all the silverware, except for a large knife and a bowl and a coffee cup. The patient admits that her leaving may have had something to do with the fact that without warning, he completely gutted the house, tore out all the walls and ceilings, all the lath and plaster right down to the studs. He says he did this in order to live like a primitive. When asked if he was successful, he says it was the first step in the right direction.\"",
        "\"The patient is a 36-year-old male who lives alone since his wife and children left him two months ago. He says there\u0027s a darkness that separates him from other people, a heavy darkness, like looking at a person from the bottom of a well. He believes that if he could say the right words, then the darkness would go away. He says he sometimes knows the right words but cannot say them. Other times, he can\u0027t even think of the words to say.\"",
        "\"The patient is 36 years old and lives alone since his wife and children left him three months ago. Last week, he went fishing in the [? San Juans and now believes that there\u0027s no better fisherman than himself. He says, \u0027I can\u0027t tell you about it because talking about fishing is silly, like farting and tap dancing at the same time. All I can say is I walk around in the water, and I know the instant that fish will jump for the fly. I cut open their stomachs and squeeze out the bugs in my hand, study what they eat, how it all gets digested, even the exoskeleton and wings.\u0027 He says he was sick before, but now he\u0027s OK, and that it was the fly rod, just holding the rod in his hand, that cured him. His house is clean. The electricity is on. The walls have been sheet-rocked and painted white. He says, \u0027I\u0027ll have to ask her, beg her, and maybe she\u0027ll come back.\u0027\"",
        "I had little understanding of schizophrenia before I began, and I have little more understanding now. I took the job because I had no other. I took the job because I just quit my steady job, my professional job, after realizing that what I wanted more than anything was to put my boss on the floor and stand on his throat and watch him gag. Then my wife moved out, took the kids and everything. She said, \"I\u0027ve thought about it, and I really think it\u0027s the best thing for me at this time in my life.\"",
        "And so I took the job interviewing schizophrenics because it was offered to me, and because it was all there seemed to be. And it seemed somehow predestined, a karmic response that could not be avoided. It would only be temporary, something to get through the summer. And I was told that they needed someone willing to drive around the state, through the small towns searching out individuals who were often transient and prone to hiding. I like to drive. I like to travel, and I like the idea of pursuit. So I took the job and did the job, and my life will never be the same.",
        "The patient is 21 years old and has lived with his parents since his discharge from the Army. He has no friends, no recreational activities and no social life. He spends his time writing and reading, but these activities do not give him any pleasure. He has lost weight, has general anxiety and loss of libido and occasional feelings of unreality. He is worried about his unpredictable behavior. For example, getting down on all fours and chewing the grass because he was thinking what it would be like to be a cow.",
        "The patient is 25 years old and believes that she is the devil and therefore responsible for all the evil in the world. She has not been out of her house for seven days and only comes down from her room for meals. A few days ago, her mother walked into her room and found her crying. She asked her mother what was the most painful punishment that one human being could inflict upon another. The mother tried to get the reason for this question, and her daughter mumbled something about the devil having to be punished for the benefit of humanity, something about having to die for his sins. When the mother asked her if she still thought she was the devil, she answered, \"Let\u0027s not get into that again. It only upsets you, and you don\u0027t believe me anyway, even when the evidence is all around you, plain for you to see.\"",
        "The people I interview are all so sad, so lonely with such thin souls, like ghosts and demons have invaded their hearts and are sucking their souls dry. A person\u0027s soul should be like an ocean, but a schizophrenic\u0027s soul is like a pool of rain in a parking lot. They suffer, and they are completely alone in their suffering. And there\u0027s nothing I can do, nothing anyone can do, to bring them back. I come home at night and cry. I sob like a three-year-old.",
        "Today, halfway through an interview with a man in Tooele, he says \"I have a crystal in my pouch. Do you want to see it?\" I say \"OK,\" and he takes it out, a normal crystal the size of a large paper clip. And he says, \"I can look through this, and it will tell me whether you\u0027re a good person or a bad person. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look through it or not?\" My first thought is to say, \"Do you want to go on with the interview? Maybe when we\u0027re done, you can look through the crystal.\""

        "I hear this maybe a dozen times while I hang out with the tribe. Phyllis Ivy, an enthusiastic member of the tribe, listens in on my interview with Ephraim, and then she jumps in.",
        "The original producer or Hair, Michael Butler, traveled the country for two years looking for a college production of the show that he could turn into a national touring company. He chose this group because on stage, in some undefinable way, they seem like a real tribe. They have the spirit of a real tribe, even if they aren\u0027t the greatest singers and dancers. And in the early days of rehearsals for the national tour, they had encounter sessions where it was drilled into them that this is more than just a show, that this is more than just a business, that they really are a tribe.",
        "But of course it is a business. People have jobs to do. They have to be able to sing and act and show up on time. And when the producers take the show on the road, they\u0027ll face a business problem. There\u0027s only enough money to bring about 25 of the cast members, downsizing from 38. Phyllis Ivy says it\u0027d be understandable if they chose the best singers and performers.",
        "This sounds common sense, but within the world of this tribe, it\u0027s heresy. They\u0027ve been told that everyone belongs in the tribe if they believe in it and work hard. A few cast members stand and listen to Phyllis say this with their arms crossed. And then they come over. \"Can I pipe in?\" one of them asks.",
        "When Phyllis Ivy responds, she\u0027s trembling.",
        "I walk downstairs, and I\u0027m surprised to see how quickly word spreads that I saw them disagreeing. They want me to believe they get along. When I go into the rec room, where some of the guys are playing ping pong, a cast member comes looking for Nathan, one of the de facto leaders of the tribe.",
        "You have to talk to me?",
        "There\u0027s a hurried conversation around the corner. Nathan returns with a speech to make to me.",
        "Nathan is not just spinning me. He believes this. He\u0027s completely sincere. Of everyone in this group, Nathan, at 21, is the one everyone says is a real hippie. Nathan dressed like a hippie. He looked like a hippie even before he got a part in Hair. An for nine months now, he\u0027s been a peacekeeper in the group, someone whose earnestness and belief in getting along and taking care of each other has helped keep the group going.",
        "But now, while Nathan talks about love holding the cast together even when 13 people might get cut, one of the guys in the room, Rod, snorts and mutters under his breath. And then he lays into Nathan.",
        "Are you going to go on the tour?",
        "Unintentionally over the course of nine months, the tribe has revived another part of \u002760\u0027s communal living along with peace and love. It\u0027s resentment, competitiveness and paranoia. I was taken aback when I asked Derek an innocent question like, \"What\u0027s the tribe like?\" And he responded this way.",
        "I did those interviews a few weeks ago. And for now, the cast is off-tour. Most of them are at school. No decisions have been made yet about who would tour in the spring, and so everyone is still getting along. When they run into each other at school though, members of the tribe still hug each other, just like they always have. And another student said to them recently, \"When are you guys going to cut out all that love crap?\"",
        "When I arrive at the dorm, it\u0027s 1:30 in the afternoon, and most of the tribe is just getting out of bed. The show\u0027s choreographer is playing Prince on a boombox in the second floor lobby to wake everyone up. About six people dance, and late risers in towels and boxers weave their way around them on their way to the showers. Some of them stop for hugs. I collar one for questioning.",
        "So are you a happy member of the tribe?",
        "What does the tribe do for you?"

            "But then, I realized that he\u0027s really asking me to take his test, just like I\u0027m asking him to take mine. I come into his house, I ask him very personal questions, and I expect him to answer honestly. And why should he? So I say, \"OK, go ahead.\" And he puts the crystal up to his eye, turns it clockwise and counterclockwise, back and forth, squinting, looking me up and down. And he says, \"I can\u0027t tell for sure. I\u0027m going to have to read your mind. Here, take my hand.\"",
            "He holds out his right hand with the crystal resting in the palm. I take his hand, and he puts his left hand over mine and squeezes it tight and shakes it and goes into a small spasm. The he lets go, and sits back like he\u0027s exhausted. He asks me if I felt anything, and I say, \"Maybe a little.\" And he says, \"I sent you a message. I put it in your mind. I told you what is wrong with me.\"",
            "I\u0027m not supposed to figure out what\u0027s wrong with these people. I\u0027m just supposed to ask the questions and score the answers from one to seven. This is partly because I\u0027m not a doctor and might get something going that I wouldn\u0027t know how to contain. But it\u0027s mainly because my supervisors want clean data. They want all the people asking the questions to be doing it in the same way. I\u0027m not supposed to get emotional. I\u0027m not supposed to let the patient get emotional. The therapy part of the county mental health system is in another department. I wouldn\u0027t even know what number to call, and I\u0027ve been told more than once not to worry about it. I should never have let him take the crystal out of his pouch.",
            "I drove around all day trying to find a Navajo man. He lives very close to the Four Corners, the cross where Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona meet. It\u0027s all dirt roads, a house every five miles or so, no addresses, no phones. I stop at every house and knock on the door, but either nobody\u0027s home, or nobody will answer. I flag down every car that passes and ask directions, and the people offer complicated directions that I follow as best as possible, sometimes driving for 20 or 30 miles. But it\u0027s always the wrong place, or nobody\u0027s home, or there just isn\u0027t a house there at all.",
            "Driving around, I think about how I have some of the same problems as the people I interview. I\u0027m angry, depressed, prone to paranoid delusions, and I worry a lot. Up to now, I thought these were common problems, and that I was more or less able to control them. But now, I don\u0027t know. I feel like I\u0027m just faking it. Eventually, late in the afternoon, I find the man, or at least I think he\u0027s the man. I\u0027m a third of the way through the test before I realize he\u0027s not the right guy.",

            "I come back the next morning and interview the son in the kitchen. They make coffee for me on a propane camp stove as the house has no electricity. The son is 19 years old, a good looking kid, tall, healthy, says he used to run cross country in high school. He seems to be fine, but as I go through the questions, he starts to fix his eyes on mine, a direct, almost hypnotic stare straight into my head like he\u0027s trying to pull me in and trap me. I try to look back, to look just as deeply into his mind, but it\u0027s like looking into a cave.",
            "He says he hears voices, satanic voices, and that he worries a lot about his shoes, that they\u0027re not the right kind, not the kind he sees on MTV. I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s sick, or if he\u0027s just trying to torture me. And I drive away thinking, I don\u0027t know anything about this disease, that I know even less than when I started. I spent two days driving around and I made $30. And I feel really, really, tired.",
            "The house is dark as all the windows have heavy curtains pulled nearly shut. The curtains over the big picture window in the living room are open just a bit, and the light cuts through like a laser beam and hits the red, shag carpet, throwing up small dust particles and cigarette ash. Two feet away from the light, near the television, is a slice of pizza lying upside down in the carpet. I\u0027m interviewing a woman, a mother, and her teenage daughter is on the phone talking to her boyfriend, or rather a series of boyfriends who call and call, and all of them wanted to go out right now, but her mother won\u0027t let her. She\u0027s trying to answer my questions, trying to concentrate and be polite, but she\u0027s mainly listening to what her daughter is saying on the phone. And will suddenly switch from saying, \"No, no, I\u0027ve been feeling fine. I haven\u0027t had a relapse and months,\" to screaming out, \"Is that John? I told you never to talk to him again.\" Or, \"Who is it? Is it a boy? You can\u0027t go out. Tell him he has to come over here.\"",
            "I can\u0027t stop looking at the slice of pizza on the carpet. I keep looking at the slice of pizza because it\u0027s the only clue that the woman is sick. I mean she has a teenage daughter and a dirty house, and maybe she shouldn\u0027t try to wear her makeup to bed, but these are not necessarily symptoms of schizophrenia. She seems to be fine, just worn out, until I get to the question, \"Have you been worrying a lot?\" And she says yes she has. She\u0027s been worrying a lot that the elders of the Church, the Mormon Church, will take her daughter away from her.",
            "I was hired to interview men and women in the state of Utah who receive Medicaid support for treatment of mental illnesses generally diagnosed as schizophrenia.",
            "And I ask her why, and she says because she stopped taking her medication. And I ask her, \"Why did you stop taking your medication?\" And she says that the only reason she takes it is because she told her bishop that she was visited by the archangel Gabriel, and that she had had sex with him. And then, she was also visited by the archangel Michael, and that she had sex with both of them at once. And that they\u0027d ravished her almost every night. So her bishop made her go to a doctor, and the doctor gave her some pills. And she took the pills, and the angels stopped coming. The bishop and the elders had told her that if she had sex with any more angels, they\u0027d take her daughter away. So I asked her again why she\u0027d stopped taking her medication. And she says, \"I\u0027m lonely. I miss them. I want them to come back.\"",
            "Today in a restaurant eating lunch between interviews, I decided to take the test. I answered the questions and scored myself appropriately, and at some point I realized I wasn\u0027t doing so well. I decided not to even add up the points because then I\u0027d be left with a score, and I\u0027d never forget it. If I were to write a report on myself, it would sound something like this.",
            "\"The patient is 36 years old and lives alone since his wife left him three weeks ago. She took the kids and all the silverware, except for a large knife and a bowl and a coffee cup. The patient admits that her leaving may have had something to do with the fact that without warning, he completely gutted the house, tore out all the walls and ceilings, all the lath and plaster right down to the studs. He says he did this in order to live like a primitive. When asked if he was successful, he says it was the first step in the right direction.\"",
            "\"The patient is a 36-year-old male who lives alone since his wife and children left him two months ago. He says there\u0027s a darkness that separates him from other people, a heavy darkness, like looking at a person from the bottom of a well. He believes that if he could say the right words, then the darkness would go away. He says he sometimes knows the right words but cannot say them. Other times, he can\u0027t even think of the words to say.\"",
            "\"The patient is 36 years old and lives alone since his wife and children left him three months ago. Last week, he went fishing in the [? San Juans and now believes that there\u0027s no better fisherman than himself. He says, \u0027I can\u0027t tell you about it because talking about fishing is silly, like farting and tap dancing at the same time. All I can say is I walk around in the water, and I know the instant that fish will jump for the fly. I cut open their stomachs and squeeze out the bugs in my hand, study what they eat, how it all gets digested, even the exoskeleton and wings.\u0027 He says he was sick before, but now he\u0027s OK, and that it was the fly rod, just holding the rod in his hand, that cured him. His house is clean. The electricity is on. The walls have been sheet-rocked and painted white. He says, \u0027I\u0027ll have to ask her, beg her, and maybe she\u0027ll come back.\u0027\"",
            "I had little understanding of schizophrenia before I began, and I have little more understanding now. I took the job because I had no other. I took the job because I just quit my steady job, my professional job, after realizing that what I wanted more than anything was to put my boss on the floor and stand on his throat and watch him gag. Then my wife moved out, took the kids and everything. She said, \"I\u0027ve thought about it, and I really think it\u0027s the best thing for me at this time in my life.\"",
            "And so I took the job interviewing schizophrenics because it was offered to me, and because it was all there seemed to be. And it seemed somehow predestined, a karmic response that could not be avoided. It would only be temporary, something to get through the summer. And I was told that they needed someone willing to drive around the state, through the small towns searching out individuals who were often transient and prone to hiding. I like to drive. I like to travel, and I like the idea of pursuit. So I took the job and did the job, and my life will never be the same.",
            "The patient is 21 years old and has lived with his parents since his discharge from the Army. He has no friends, no recreational activities and no social life. He spends his time writing and reading, but these activities do not give him any pleasure. He has lost weight, has general anxiety and loss of libido and occasional feelings of unreality. He is worried about his unpredictable behavior. For example, getting down on all fours and chewing the grass because he was thinking what it would be like to be a cow.",
            "The patient is 25 years old and believes that she is the devil and therefore responsible for all the evil in the world. She has not been out of her house for seven days and only comes down from her room for meals. A few days ago, her mother walked into her room and found her crying. She asked her mother what was the most painful punishment that one human being could inflict upon another. The mother tried to get the reason for this question, and her daughter mumbled something about the devil having to be punished for the benefit of humanity, something about having to die for his sins. When the mother asked her if she still thought she was the devil, she answered, \"Let\u0027s not get into that again. It only upsets you, and you don\u0027t believe me anyway, even when the evidence is all around you, plain for you to see.\"",
            "The people I interview are all so sad, so lonely with such thin souls, like ghosts and demons have invaded their hearts and are sucking their souls dry. A person\u0027s soul should be like an ocean, but a schizophrenic\u0027s soul is like a pool of rain in a parking lot. They suffer, and they are completely alone in their suffering. And there\u0027s nothing I can do, nothing anyone can do, to bring them back. I come home at night and cry. I sob like a three-year-old.",
            "Today, halfway through an interview with a man in Tooele, he says \"I have a crystal in my pouch. Do you want to see it?\" I say \"OK,\" and he takes it out, a normal crystal the size of a large paper clip. And he says, \"I can look through this, and it will tell me whether you\u0027re a good person or a bad person. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look through it or not?\" My first thought is to say, \"Do you want to go on with the interview? Maybe when we\u0027re done, you can look through the crystal.\""

I mean that\u0027s a word you don\u0027t really use very often to describe people, adults, in front of you, but they were more or less skipping down the street, chattering, half walking, half running. And they greet us joyously and look us in the eye. And they surround us, and they seem curious and happy and alive. It seems like a group of three or four dozen people who are in love, in love, all of them.",

And they say things like--",

            "I hear this maybe a dozen times while I hang out with the tribe. Phyllis Ivy, an enthusiastic member of the tribe, listens in on my interview with Ephraim, and then she jumps in.",
            "The original producer or Hair, Michael Butler, traveled the country for two years looking for a college production of the show that he could turn into a national touring company. He chose this group because on stage, in some undefinable way, they seem like a real tribe. They have the spirit of a real tribe, even if they aren\u0027t the greatest singers and dancers. And in the early days of rehearsals for the national tour, they had encounter sessions where it was drilled into them that this is more than just a show, that this is more than just a business, that they really are a tribe.",
            "But of course it is a business. People have jobs to do. They have to be able to sing and act and show up on time. And when the producers take the show on the road, they\u0027ll face a business problem. There\u0027s only enough money to bring about 25 of the cast members, downsizing from 38. Phyllis Ivy says it\u0027d be understandable if they chose the best singers and performers.",
            "This sounds common sense, but within the world of this tribe, it\u0027s heresy. They\u0027ve been told that everyone belongs in the tribe if they believe in it and work hard. A few cast members stand and listen to Phyllis say this with their arms crossed. And then they come over. \"Can I pipe in?\" one of them asks.",
            "When Phyllis Ivy responds, she\u0027s trembling.",
            "I walk downstairs, and I\u0027m surprised to see how quickly word spreads that I saw them disagreeing. They want me to believe they get along. When I go into the rec room, where some of the guys are playing ping pong, a cast member comes looking for Nathan, one of the de facto leaders of the tribe.",
            "You have to talk to me?",
            "There\u0027s a hurried conversation around the corner. Nathan returns with a speech to make to me.",
            "Nathan is not just spinning me. He believes this. He\u0027s completely sincere. Of everyone in this group, Nathan, at 21, is the one everyone says is a real hippie. Nathan dressed like a hippie. He looked like a hippie even before he got a part in Hair. An for nine months now, he\u0027s been a peacekeeper in the group, someone whose earnestness and belief in getting along and taking care of each other has helped keep the group going.",
            "But now, while Nathan talks about love holding the cast together even when 13 people might get cut, one of the guys in the room, Rod, snorts and mutters under his breath. And then he lays into Nathan.",
            "Are you going to go on the tour?",
            "Unintentionally over the course of nine months, the tribe has revived another part of \u002760\u0027s communal living along with peace and love. It\u0027s resentment, competitiveness and paranoia. I was taken aback when I asked Derek an innocent question like, \"What\u0027s the tribe like?\" And he responded this way.",
            "I did those interviews a few weeks ago. And for now, the cast is off-tour. Most of them are at school. No decisions have been made yet about who would tour in the spring, and so everyone is still getting along. When they run into each other at school though, members of the tribe still hug each other, just like they always have. And another student said to them recently, \"When are you guys going to cut out all that love crap?\"",
            "When I arrive at the dorm, it\u0027s 1:30 in the afternoon, and most of the tribe is just getting out of bed. The show\u0027s choreographer is playing Prince on a boombox in the second floor lobby to wake everyone up. About six people dance, and late risers in towels and boxers weave their way around them on their way to the showers. Some of them stop for hugs. I collar one for questioning.",
            "So are you a happy member of the tribe?",
            "What does the tribe do for you?"

            "All of the loading crews were black. There were no white loading crews. You didn\u0027t have a lot of white people that you saw.",
            "Each one would put up money that their division would out-load the other one for those particular shifts or that particular day. They had day lotteries, week, and whole ship lottery.",
            "The lights were out at 10:00. So the lights went out at 10:00. We were all returned to our bunk.",
            "I\u0027m laying there with my hands behind my head looking out at the sky. And at that time, I guess a few minutes after the lights went out, the sky lit up, and it was just like the sun rose. Everything was bright. You could see all the buildings for a second.",
            "Then came the concussion. The concussion blew a hole in my body. My left arm got mutilated. Face, head, neck, shoulders and body got mutilated. That was the first explosion. The second was just a few seconds afterwards. That lifted me out of the bunk and threw me on the floor.",
            "You could hear the people now screaming and yelling, \"Get out of the barracks. It\u0027s coming down.\" So I myself scuffled, crawled out and took off for the outside.",
            "When I got outside, there were a few people outside yelling for volunteers to go down to the docks. I went up to the guy and said, \"Hey, I want to volunteer.\" He asked me, \"Did you see Percy get out of the barracks?\" He didn\u0027t recognize me. He was my squad leader because my face was so mutilated from the blood and guts.",
            "I think I was in the hospital maybe all week, and I think the day after, I returned to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. We were ordered to go to work, and I still was bandaged up, face, arms. My stitches were still there and everything. So we were lined up outside the barracks to go to work. They hadn\u0027t told us what we had to do yet, but then they said, \"Forward march.\"",
            "Then the Admiral came down and explained to us what our responsibilities were.",
            "From my upbringing, my mother taught me that if a white man threatened to hang you, he would do it at his first legal chance. And she told me about the Klan, and she was brought up in Mississippi. So I believed that they had a legal chance to shoot us, so I was afraid. So I said well, I\u0027m not going to give them a change to shoot me. I\u0027ll go back to work.",
            "My job basically was to load ammunition with the crew, which worked in the hold of the ship.",

            "Frequently, the urgent need for ammunition forced the depot to load two ships at the same time at the same pier. So it was on the night of July 17, 1944. The Quinault Victory and the E.A. Bryan were moored at the Naval magazine, Port Chicago. 16 cars of ammunition and bombs were spotted on the pier beside the Quinault Victory as the ship rigged to load. Bryan had been loading day and night for more than three days. 3.5 million pounds of explosives were aboard or waiting nearby on the pier. Everything was normal until 10:19.",
            "We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this important bulletin from the United Press. Flash, Washington. The White House announces Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Stay tuned to WOR for further development, which will be broadcast immediately as received.",
            "In the Pacific war, American battleships, cruisers and destroyers shelled Guam island on Sunday for the second straight day. Here at home, officials say that 337 persons are known dead or missing and presumed dead, more than 300 hundred others injured, as the result of last night\u0027s explosion of two ammunition ships at Port Chicago in upper San Francisco Bay. And now, General Electric takes you to Washington.",
            "In the waterfront barracks and administration area, buildings crumpled like cardboard, roofs blown off, walls gone. In the vicinity of the loading piers, total destruction. Both ships broken, twisted hulks.",
            "Meantime, the court of inquiry was collecting testimony and exhibits. Experts in all fields were called in to study the area. The cause of the explosion could not be fixed with certainty, but it was suspected that a depth charge was accidentally detonated.",
            "7:00 PM, Eastern Wartime. Bob Trout reporting. The Japanese have accepted our terms fully. That\u0027s the word we have just received from the White House in Washington. This, ladies and gentleman, is the end of the Second World War. The United Nations, on land, on the sea, in the air and to the four corners of the Earth, are united and are victorious."

It\u0027s not live.\" They said they don\u0027t have any detonators in them.",
            "Well, the white officers, they didn\u0027t have much to do with us anymore. And to stand around and supervise and see that we loaded that ammunition.",
            "That was a shocking thing to see those ships torn up and seeing-- I was standing watch over all those dead bodies. I had to stand watch over that. That was my duty, and you couldn\u0027t tell one from the others.",
            "We felt like just we were getting a raw deal because we were the ones that were doing the dirty work. We were the ones that were fooling with the ammunition. So why shouldn\u0027t we have a leave of absence to get away to get your nerves settled. But that didn\u0027t happen.",
            "He told us-- he said \"Well, one thing I want to tell you is that you could be charged with mutiny if you don\u0027t go back to work.\"",
            "It was the cue. When he said you could be shot, then the fellows went to mumbling. You know, a lot of people are afraid to die.",
            "But then 50 of us decided we weren\u0027t going to go back to work. If we were going to get shot, they just had to shoot us because we weren\u0027t going to go back and load anymore ammunition.",
            "We didn\u0027t commit any mutiny. We didn\u0027t take over any ship. We didn\u0027t take over a base. We had no weapons. We didn\u0027t even have a pen. We only refused to go back to work. Now how could that be mutiny?",
            "Well, the mutiny trial-- it\u0027s just like a thing that is cut and dry. We were all sitting over here. All the white officers were over here. We weren\u0027t allowed to say anything but what they would ask us.",
            "The lowest sentence in there, I think, was eight years. I had 12 years. And some had 16.",
            "I used to not be able to talk about it because it would hurt. It would hurt inside. You didn\u0027t want your friends to know that you was in the service, and you had been charged with mutiny. You didn\u0027t want people to think that you didn\u0027t like your country or something, that you\u0027d do something like that. They\u0027re still in this country we knew about.",
            "We can think of ourselves as a hero because we stood up for our rights. We stood up because we knew that we did not commit mutiny.",
            "Long ways back. It doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s been 50 years, and it still hangs over us at 50 years.",
            "You\u0027d be down in the hold. Here come those big bombs and things coming down the ramp-way they had built. But sometimes, they let it come down too fast. And they hit together, and they made a loud noise."

            "After Pearl Harbor, the Navy opened to blacks for the first time. But rather than get sent out on ships, one large group of African American men found themselves stationed in one of the least desirable dumps. It was literally a dump, an ammo dump called Port Chicago. This is just north of San Francisco. Now, the place is called Concord Naval Weapons Station. Their job was to load ammunition onto ships, and conditions were so unsafe that it was the site of the worst stateside disaster of the war. On July 17, 1944, two ships blew up, killing 320 men and rocking all of San Francisco in what many people thought was just an earthquake.",
            "A court of inquiry blamed the sailors. It concluded-- here\u0027s a quote, \"The colored enlisted personnel are neither temperamentally nor intellectually capable of handling high explosives.\" Well, when survivors were ordered right back to work-- the guys who had survived the whole thing, they were sent right back to work. They were told, go back to work under the same conditions. 50 of them refused, and they were sentenced to up to 15 years of hard labor.",
            "Over the years since then, there have been many attempts to clear their names, including in 1944 by then civil rights attorney, Thurgood Marshall. Dan Collison spoke with five survivors of the incident about what really happened at Port Chicago.",
            "Albert Williams, Freddie Meeks, Joseph Small, Percy Robinson and Robert Routh talked to Dan Collison, who produced that story. Gary Covina was the editor. Funding for the story came from the Funding Exchange. The Navy has made it a policy never to discuss the Port Chicago case, and has never exonerated the sailors who were court-martialed. In 1999, President Clinton pardoned one of the survivors, Freddie Meeks."

Let the voicemail system answer it. This is your voicemail system manual. There are no personal phone calls allowed. These are your in and out boxes. You must pace your work. What do I mean? I\u0027m glad you asked that. We pace our work according to eight-hour workday. If you have twelve hours of work in your inbox, for example, you must compress that work into an eight-hour day. If you have one hour of work in your inbox, you must expand that to fill the eight-hour day. That was a good question. Feel free to ask questions. Ask too many questions, however, and you may be let go.",

For Amanda Pierce, it\u0027s just a tedious bus ride made less tedious by the idle nattering of Russell Nash. But for Russell Nash, it\u0027s the highlight of his day, It\u0027s the highlight of his life. Russell Nash has put on 40 pounds and grows fatter with each passing month, nibbling on chips and cookies while peeking glumly over the partition at Amanda Pierce, engorging himself at home on cold pizza and ice cream while watching adult videos on TV.",

Her cubicle is plastered from top to bottom with the boy\u0027s crayon artwork, sheet after sheet of precisely drawn concentric circles and ellipsis in black and yellow. She rotates them every other Friday. Be sure to comment on them. Amanda Pierce also has a husband who\u0027s a lawyer. He subjects her to an escalating array of painful and humiliating sex games to which Amanda Pierce reluctantly submits. But we\u0027re not supposed to know any of this. Do not let on. If you let on, you may be let go.",

You are not, however, allowed to cook food in the microwave oven. This is the refrigerator. You may put you lunch in it. Barry Hacker, who sits over there, steals food from the refrigerator. His petty theft is an outlet for his grief. Last New Year\u0027s Eve while kissing his wife, a blood vessel burst in her brain. Barry Hacker\u0027s wife was two months pregnant at the time and lingered in a coma for a half year before dying. It was a tragic loss for Barry Hacker. He hasn\u0027t been himself since. Barry Hacker\u0027s wife was a beautiful woman. She was also completely covered. Barry Hacker did not have to pay one dime.",

We\u0027ve seen the dim shadow of her face in our photocopies. She pencils herself into the receptionist\u0027s appointment book with the notation, \"To see Barry Hacker.\" She left messages in the receptionist\u0027s voicemail box, messages garbled by the electronic chirps and buzzes in the phone line, her voice echoing from an immense distance within the ambient hum. But the voice is hers, and beneath her voice, beneath the tidal whoosh of static and hiss, the gurgling and crying of a baby can be heard. In any case, if you bring a lunch, put a little something extra in it for Barry Hacker. We have four Barry\u0027s in the office. Isn\u0027t that a coincidence?",
            "This is the custodian\u0027s closet. You have no business to be in the custodian\u0027s closet. Kevin Howard sits in that cubicle over there. He is a serial killer, the one they call the Carpet Cutter, responsible for the mutilations across town. We\u0027re not supposed to know that, so do not let on. Don\u0027t worry. His compulsion inflicts itself only upon strangers, and the routine established is elaborate and unwavering. The victim must be a white male, a young adult no older than 30, heavyset with dark hair and eyes and the like. The victim must be chosen at random, before sunset, from a public place. The victim is followed home and must put up a struggle, et cetera. Kevin Howard does not let any of this interfere with his work. He is, in fact, our fastest typist. He types as if he were on fire. In any case, when Kevin Howard gets caught, act surprised. Say that he seemed like a nice person, a bit of a loner perhaps, but always quiet and polite."

She pencils herself into the receptionist\u0027s appointment book with the notation, \"To see Barry Hacker.\" She left messages in the receptionist\u0027s voicemail box, messages garbled by the electronic chirps and buzzes in the phone line, her voice echoing from an immense distance within the ambient hum. But the voice is hers, and beneath her voice, beneath the tidal whoosh of static and hiss, the gurgling and crying of a baby can be heard. In any case, if you bring a lunch, put a little something extra in it for Barry Hacker. We have four Barry\u0027s in the office. Isn\u0027t that a coincidence?"

He is a serial killer, the one they call the Carpet Cutter, responsible for the mutilations across town. We\u0027re not supposed to know that, so do not let on. Don\u0027t worry. His compulsion inflicts itself only upon strangers, and the routine established is elaborate and unwavering. The victim must be a white male, a young adult no older than 30, heavyset with dark hair and eyes and the like. The victim must be chosen at random, before sunset, from a public place. The victim is followed home and must put up a struggle, et cetera. Kevin Howard does not let any of this interfere with his work. He is, in fact, our fastest typist. He types as if he were on fire. In any case, when Kevin Howard gets caught, act surprised. Say that he seemed like a nice person, a bit of a loner perhaps, but always quiet and polite."
