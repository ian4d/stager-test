The more suspects she identified over the course of a season, the more confident she became.",

They crawl around the dining room floor, looking through purses, while the food sits in the kitchen, cooking itself. Come on now, think. Who uses a knife to commit a crime? In a world of guns, what kind of person would use a knife? Give up? It\u0027s just two little words, drug addict. It\u0027s just that simple. A professional thief would use a gun. But even a second-hand gun costs money. A drug addict can\u0027t afford a gun. They need all their money for their dope and smack, the hard stuff. These dopers have a habit to feed every minute of every day, which means they\u0027re always on the lookout for their next mark.

He took it last Thursday from that couple on Pamlico. You saw the report in the paper, the brand new Ford Mustang, remember? You thought it\u0027d been stolen by gypsies. And I said we don\u0027t even have gypsies in this part of the country. I said the car had been taken by a dope addict who\u0027d use it for a couple of burglaries before selling it to a chop shop.

It was always the work of a drug addict or a former police officer, a renegade, a rogue. To hear my mother talk, you\u0027d think the sunny, manicured streets of suburban Raleigh were crawling with heroin addicts, the needles poking through the sleeves of their tattered police uniforms.",
            "It embarrassed me to hear her use phrases like \"copping a fix\" and \"pusherman.\" \"I have to go now,\" she\u0027d say to the grocery clerk. \"My mother-in-law\u0027s back at the house, jonesing for her lunch.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" they\u0027d say, \"Come again?\" Only on network television did people talk this way.",
            "\"I call the TV,\" they\u0027d say. It didn\u0027t matter what you were watching when my mother or sister laid claim to one of the televisions. You surrendered it the same way cars gave up the road at the sight of an advancing ambulance.",
            "I couldn\u0027t bear the detective shows but made it a point to regularly check in with The Fugitive. This was the story of Dr. Richard Kimble, a man on the run. Falsely accused of a crime he did not commit, we were told in the opening credits that \"he changed his name and his identity.\" The notion of identity was illustrated by a can of shoe polish sitting on what appeared to be the scuffed surface of a motel dresser.",
            "This had me stumped for months. \"What?\" I asked. \"Would nobody recognize him with freshly shined shoes? Did he use it to blacken his face? I don\u0027t get it.\" \"His hair, stupid,\" my sister Lisa said. \"He used it to dye his hair.\"",
            "Lisa liked The Fugitive because, she said, \"He\u0027s easy on the eyes.\" The way she saw it, Dr. Kimble needed only two things, a one-armed suspect and the love of a good woman. She failed to understand that despite his brooding good looks, a man of his nature could never be happy. Unlike her nightly lineup of swinging gumshoes, the Fugitive had both a soul and a memory, and would remain a haunted man long after his wife\u0027s true killer had been brought to justice.",
            "Most programs discouraged you from concentrating on the hero\u0027s dark inner workings. If the girlfriend was gunned down at her makeup table, you knew there\u0027d be another one next week to replace her, no questions asked. The Fugitive had no fancy convertible or stylish wet bar. He was cut from a different cloth, my kind of cloth, the itchy kind. Lisa wouldn\u0027t know a sensitive loner if he crawled into her lap with a fistful of daisies. And it annoyed me when she labeled The Fugitive as \"my kind of show.\"",
            "It was one thing to sit in front of the television, second-guessing a third-rate detective program, but quite another to solve a real case. We were well into our summer reruns when our household was shaken by a series of very real crimes no TV detective could ever hope to crack. Someone in our family had taken to wiping their ass on the bath towels.",
            "What made this exceptionally disturbing was that all of our towels were fudge-colored. You\u0027d be drying your hair when too late, you\u0027d notice an unmistakable odor on your hands, head, and face. If nothing else, life in the suburbs promised that one might go from day to day without finding stool samples in their hair. This sudden turn of events tested our resolve to the core, leaving us to wonder who we were and where we, as a people, had gone wrong.",
            "Soul searching aside, it also called for plenty of hot water, gallons of shampoo, steel wool, industrial scrub brushes, and blocks of harsh, deodorizing soap. The criminal hit all three bathrooms, pausing just long enough to convince the rest of us that it was finally safe to let our guard down. I might spend 20 minutes carefully sniffing the towel, only to discover that this time, they\u0027d used to washcloth.",
            "\"Well,\" my mother said, thumbing through the newspaper one Sunday morning, \"the person doing this is one sick individual. That much we know for certain.\" \"And they eat corn,\" Lisa said, patting her head with a T-shirt. The most recent victim, she had washed her hair so many times it now resembled the wiry, synthetic mane of a troll doll.",
            "Everyone had their theories, but no one had any hard evidence. Discounting my parents, that still left six children and my grandmother, all possible suspects. I eliminated myself. And because the towels were carefully folded, I excused my brother, who, to this day, cannot manage such a complex activity.",
            "It must smart to use a towel for such a delicate purpose. And I watched as my family took their seats at the table, waiting for someone to cry out or flinch. But nothing came of it.",
            "My mother and sister had always thought themselves so wily and smart. But when pressed for a suspect, they said only that this case was beneath them. If someone were to be murdered or kidnapped, they\u0027d rise to the occasion and finger the guilty party within an hour.",
            "This particular case, however, fell under the category of aggravated mischief, and was therefore unworthy of their professional attention. Whoever it was would listen to their conscience and confess sooner or later. And in the meantime, my mother would stock the linen closet with white towels. Case closed.",
            "Later that month, someone went through my father\u0027s top drawer, stealing a knee sock packed with 112 liberty silver dollars. I knew my father\u0027s drawers as well as I knew my own. Everyone did. That was how you occupied your time when you had the house to yourself. You rifled through my father\u0027s drawers before moving on to his second hiding place in the shed.",
            "I had seen and counted these coins many times. We all had. But who would go so far as to steal them?",
            "My father gathered us together in the dining room and listened as we each took turns denying any involvement. \"Dollars come in silver? I never knew that. Does the government issue them in a knee sock, or was that your idea?\"",
            "\"OK,\" my father said. \"all right. I understand now. Nobody took my coins. I guess they just got tired of living cooped up in that dresser and decided to roll out the door and spend themselves on candy and magazines. That\u0027s what happened, isn\u0027t it? Oh, they\u0027re probably out there as we speak, having themselves a grand old time, aren\u0027t they?\"",
            "His voice visited its highest register, and he rubbed his hands together as if he were considering a tray of rich desserts. \"Free at last. Free at last, with their whole lives ahead of them. Can\u0027t you just feel the excitement? Doesn\u0027t it make you just want to throw up your hands and scream?\"",
            "He lowered his voice to deliver a series of ultimatums I didn\u0027t quite catch. My mind was snagged on the thought of those jubilant silver dollars, raucous and dizzy with their first feelings of independence. I pictured them splitting into groups and traveling by night to avoid any excess attention. It might prove difficult to roll over grass and leaves, so I imagined them huddled in the carport, deciding it best to stick to the roads and sidewalks.",
            "The thought of it made me laugh. And when I did, my father said, \"You think this is funny? You\u0027re getting a chuckle out of this, are you? I\u0027m glad you find it so amusing. Let\u0027s see how funny it is when I search your room, funny guy.\"",
            "On television, a search warrant guaranteed that your home would be trashed. And this was no different. Mine was the only clean room in the entire house. This was my shrine, my temple, and I watched in horror as my drawers were emptied and my closets brutally divorced of order.",
            "While searching my desk, he came across a gold-plated mechanical pencil my father recognized as his own. It had once occupied the same drawer as his coins. And I admitted that, yes, I had taken the pencil. But I hadn\u0027t really stolen it.",
            "There was a big difference between the two. You steal things that you covet, while you take things the original owner is incapable of appreciating. The pencil had spoken to me of its neglect, and I \u0027d offered to put it to good use.",
            "Taking is just borrowing without the formality. I\u0027d planned on returning it once it ran out of lead. What was the big deal?",
            "The moment my father and his pencil were reunited, I became the prime suspect, tried and convicted on circumstantial evidence. There was nothing I could say to change his mind. Falsely convicted of a crime I didn\u0027t commit, there was only one thing I could do. The shoe polish was kept in the linen closet. I chose black.",
            "The Fugitive\u0027s hair always looked perfectly natural. It blew in the breeze created by oncoming trucks as he stood beside the lonesome road, bidding farewell to a town unable to appreciate his unique gifts. My natural hair looked pretty much the same way. But once the polish dried, my hair hardened into a stiff, unified mass that covered my head like a helmet.",
            "I went to bed and found my sheets and pillow smudged and ruined. My face and arms were bruised-looking, and everything stank with the rigid, military odor of a buffing rag. It was no wonder the Fugitive was a loner. I liked the sheen and color of my new hair, but found I needed to slick it back in order to maintain a clean forehead.",
            "This hair of mine was bulletproof. Perhaps that\u0027s what the Fugitive saw in it. You could\u0027ve pounded my head with a golf club, and I wouldn\u0027t have felt a thing. I carried my soiled sheets into the woods, knowing that from here on out, things were going to be different. I had crossed over the edge, and there was no turning back.",
            "Having changed my identity, my next step was to find the real thief and clear my name. My mother and sister were fond of saying, \"The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" This was a bit of dime store wisdom picked up from one of their television programs, but I thought it might be worth a try.",
            "It was certainly true of whoever was wiping their ass on the towels. But then again, they had no choice. The bathroom was where we kept our toilet. And even if the criminal had changed their ways, they\u0027d still need to use the john.",
            "Aside from the silver dollars, my father\u0027s drawers were home to several pocket watches, a pair of cuff links shaped like dice, tie clips, fine cigarette lighters, and a deck of playing cards picturing an assortment of confident women wearing nothing but tool belts. Figuring the thief had good reason to return for more, I undertook a stakeout. My father\u0027s closet had shuttered, louvred doors which afforded a view of the entire room.",
            "My mother had a thing for detectives, be they old, blind, or paralyzed from the waist down, she just couldn\u0027t get enough. My older sister shared her interest. Detective worship became something they practiced together, swapping plot lines the way other mothers and daughters exchanged recipes or grooming tips.",
            "I took my place, waiting a full hour before my mother entered the room, shouting, \"I don\u0027t give a tinker\u0027s damn what they do on Mount Olympus. In this house, you don\u0027t boil a $7 steak.\" My intuition told me that she was talking to my grandmother.",
            "Slamming the door behind her, she took a seat on the edge of the unmade bed. She stared down at her bare feet and then, as if she expected them to apologize for some trouble they\u0027d recently caused, said, \"Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?\"",
            "She picked at her toenail for a moment before crossing the room to fetch a bottle of glossy polish from the top of the dresser. This was a new shade, the color of putty. Rather than highlighting the nails, it caused them to disappear into the surrounding flesh, creating a look both freakish and popular.",
            "I\u0027d never understood why anyone bothered painting their toenails, especially my mother, whose crusty, misshapen talons resembled the shattered, nugget-sized Fritos found huddled in the bottom of a bag. She stood before the mirror, shaking the bottle and frowning at the sight of her brittle, frosted hair, arranged into a listless style she referred to as \"the devil\u0027s stomping grounds.\" I watched then as she rummaged through her closet, returning with a tall, plastic box secured with the sort of latches you might find on a suitcase.",
            "I\u0027d been through my father\u0027s closet thousands of times, but never my mother\u0027s. \"If I have something of value, this is the last place I\u0027d put it,\" she\u0027d say. \"The goddamn moths don\u0027t even want what I\u0027ve got.\" My father\u0027s closets offered clues to his inner life.",
            "I enjoyed uncovering what I thought to be his secrets, but felt it best to honor my mother\u0027s privacy, not out of respect so much as fear. I didn\u0027t want any possible handcuffs or hooded leather mask interfering with the notion that this woman was first and foremost my mother.",
            "She carried the box to her dresser and unfastened the latches, lifting the lid to reveal a pale Styrofoam head supporting a sandy blonde wig, the hair sculpted into a series of cresting waves. This was a magnificent crown of hair, so perfect it might have been styled by God himself on one of those off days he was feeling creative, rather than vengeful.",
            "After carefully removing the pins, my mother placed the wig upon her head and studied herself in the mirror. She nodded her head this way and that, but the curls, defying all laws of nature, held their position. I knew the feeling, except that my rigid hairstyle was by this time basically cemented to my scalp. Fumes from the shoe polish were making me nauseous, and I had begun to perspire, the inky sweat running down my forehead and staining my shirt.",
            "\"What do you say to that, missy?\" my mother asked herself. She applied a coat of lipstick and brought her face close to the mirror, cocking her had and arching her eyebrows in a series of expressions that conveyed everything from heartfelt concern to full-throttle rage. Then she stepped away from the mirror, re-introducing herself slowly, as if her reflection were a guest she were meeting for the first time.",
            "\"What do you say we paint those toenails?\" she asked. \"Now?\" she answered. \"Sure,\" she said. \"Have a seat. It won\u0027t take but a minute. What\u0027s you\u0027re hurry? Sit down, for christ\u0027s sake. They can get along without you for half an hour. Sit.\"",
            "One television program would end and the next one begin, filling our house with the constant din of gunfire and squealing tires. Downstairs, the obese detective would collect his breath on the bow of the drug lord\u0027s pleasure craft, while up in the kitchen, his elderly colleague hurled himself over a low brick wall in pursuit of the baby-faced serial killer. \"How\u0027s your case coming?\" my mother would shout during commercial breaks. Cupping her hands to the side of her mouth, Lisa would yell, \"Tubby\u0027s still tracking down leads, but I\u0027m betting it\u0027s the Chinesey guy with the eye patch and the ponytail.\"",
            "My mother sat and opened the jar of polish. \"This is a new shade we call strained chicken,\" she said. \"All the girls are just crazy about it.\" I watched as she parted her toes and set to work, pausing every now and then to regard herself in the mirror.",
            "\"Pretty, isn\u0027t it?\" she said. \"You\u0027ll probably want to wear it with a sandal. That\u0027s what I\u0027d do, a sandal or an open-toed boot, whatever feels right for you. This is a good color for those quiet times when your weekend guests have finally passed out, and you\u0027ve got the pup tent all to yourself. I\u0027m assuming from the shape of these feet that you do a lot of hiking, am I right? No? My mistake. Ever walk over hot coals to earn yourself a little extra pocket money? I thought so. Well, you just sit back and relax. I\u0027m not here to judge.\"",
            "She finished her right foot and held it out for inspection. \"The good thing about this color is that it\u0027s forgiving. A little on the nail, a little on the toe, a little on the carpet, and everybody\u0027s happy.\"",
            "When the left foot was finished, she tossed the polish onto her dresser and fashioned a mound out of pillows, something so high that she could lie on her back without crushing her wig. It looked uncomfortable, but she seemed used to it. Spreading out her arms and legs, she closed her eyes and reclined as best she could. The unmade bed, the clothing and empty cigarette packets littering the floor, the room resembled a crime scene.",
            "Televised stake outs tend to condense the hours of monotonous waiting into a single moment of truth. The detective arrives just in time to overhear the ransom instructions or watch the jewel thief study blueprints to the bank. I stood for an hour with a headful of shoe polish, a fugitive, watching my chatty, harried nail stylist of a mother asleep in her wig. I waited and waited for something to reveal itself.",
            "After she\u0027d and left the room, I crept downstairs and washed my hair three times, taking care to rinse the tub with Comet and destroy my soiled shirt. At the sound of my father\u0027s footsteps coming through the front door, I darted into my bedroom, slapping my face and examining the glow on the darkened window. I wanted to be apple-cheeked, fresh and innocent when he rounded up the usual suspects, gathering us together in the dining room to solve the most troubling mystery of all. Who smeared his shirts and jackets with shoe polish?",
            "I take my seat beside the same people who had stolen the coins and wiped themselves on the towels and say, \"Did you say nail polish or shoe polish? On your suits? Today? No, sorry. I wouldn\u0027t know anything about that.\"",
            "Theirs was a world of obvious suspects. Looking for the axe murderer? Try the emotionally disturbed lumberjack loitering near the tool shed behind the victim\u0027s house. Who kidnapped the guidance counselor? Perhaps it\u0027s a 30-year-old 10th grader with a gym bag full of bloody rope.",
            "It was no wonder these cases were solved so quickly. Every clue was italicized with a burst of surging trumpets. And under questioning, the suspects snapped like toothpicks, buckling in less time than it took to soft boil an egg.",
            "\"You want to know who set fire to the skate ranch? All right, it was me. You satisfied now? That\u0027s right, me. I did it, me. Give me a pair of skates and a book of matches, and I\u0027ll burn this whole town down. Do you hear me?\""

            "Act One, Wannabe. Detectives are just one of those things, like amnesia, or asteroids hitting earth, or talking animals, or seven-year-olds with the wisdom of adults, one of those things that just seems to occur a lot more in the movies then they ever do in real life. But I suppose so many things fall into that category. Why detective stories, though?",
            "Somebody once said-- and I would agree with this-- that every good story is a detective story, meaning every good story in any genre raises some big question at the beginning, some thing that we want to find out. And then the process of the story, the reason why we keep reading or watching is that we just want to know. We want to know what is going to happen. What is the thing? We want the answer.",
            "Mysteries are just the purest form of this. They offer the satisfaction of this kind of story in the purest possible way. The question couldn\u0027t be clearer. There\u0027s a crime. Who did it? And by the end, all is revealed. Light is shed. We know the answer.",
            "So they\u0027re hard to resist. The problem, of course, is if you see so many detective stories, if you read so many, see so many TV shows, that you start believing that you can actually do what the fictional characters in the shows are able to do. We have this story from writer David Sedaris about his own family.",
            "David Sedaris. That story, \"True Detective,\" is in his book, Naked. His latest book is Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.",

            "Coming up, speeding through a car chase, sitting through surveillance, that all happens during two days I spent with a real private eye. That\u0027s in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues.",
            "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different stories on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Detectives, wannabe detectives, real detectives, and the difference between the two."

And so I\u0027m just going to admit up front that when I had the chance to go out with a real life private eye, this is what I expected. I expected that contrary to what you see on TV and in the movies, real detective work was going to turn out to be mundane, dull, long hours, not terribly glamorous.",
            "Today, she\u0027s supposed to be going out after work with her girlfriends from her job. We\u0027re going to wait by the store where she works and follow her to see if that\u0027s were she goes.",
            "Now, did he give you her picture or something? Do you know what she looks like?",

Somehow, based on a thousand detective stories, I\u0027d assumed that these would be middle-aged people, mature people, in a marriage that had gone stale over years. But the woman in this photo was 25 years old, beamingly happy, a suburban girl on vacation in Disneyland or someplace like that. And suddenly, it hit me, looking at this picture, the human tragedy of what was about to happen. If she were cheating on her husband, and we caught her, one way or another, her life was about to turn completely upside down, starting tonight.",
            "We circle the store where she works. And we find her car easily enough. It\u0027s out back. But finding out where we should go turns out to be surprisingly tricky. We can\u0027t just park in the alley, because she\u0027ll see us. So we have to park at one end of the alley. But then which end?",
            "If we choose the south end and she drives north, she could lose us. And then there\u0027s the fact that we need to see her without her noticing us. Fortunately, the client chooses that moment to call on Jonathan\u0027s cellular phone.",
            "And in fact, the first day I spent with detective Jonathan Rosenberg of Tower Investigations here in Chicago, I was not disappointed. When I arrived at his office, he was statementizing. That was the word he used, statementizing, meaning typing up statements from witnesses he\u0027d interviewed. Example.",
            "We find one position. But then a truck blocks our view. We move two more times. Who ever thought that this would be this complicated? Also, it\u0027s boring. I smoke one of Jonathan\u0027s Newport Lights simply to stay awake.",
            "Jonathan watches in his rear view mirror for the woman. He takes notes on the case. I take notes on him. And sitting in a car like this, in a way, it\u0027s just like you\u0027ve seen in those cop buddy movies. You really do start to talk about everything.",
            "Scarface, I didn\u0027t see Scarface. Was Scarface that good?",
            "Wow.",
            "All I heard about Scarface was it\u0027s just real violent, right? That\u0027s all I heard was it was just real violent.",
            "So you know what they call a Big Mac in France?",
            "What was it?",
            "A half hour passes, and another half hour. Someone who might have been the woman comes out, smokes a cigarette, goes back in, later, comes out again, goes back in again. If this woman was having an affair, she was in no hurry to get to the affair. Or possibly, the woman who we were waiting for left long ago through the front door of the shop, which we cannot see. Anyway, finally, after all the boredom, something happens.",
            "We spin around to follow her car, and we tail her for 15 minutes. Often, we are driving directly behind her, sometimes on nearly deserted streets. And still, she does not seem to notice, which Jonathan says is typical.",
            "And if this sounds incredible to you, OK, try this test. If you are hearing the sound of my voice in an automobile right now, let me ask you-- now don\u0027t look in your rear view mirror-- let me just ask you, what kind of car is behind you? And how long has it been there? No one pays attention to stuff like this.",
            "Not exactly The Rockford Files. Later, we drove out to an accident scene, where Jonathan took pictures and looked for witnesses, but didn\u0027t find anybody useful, which was unsurprising, really, because the accident had happened six weeks before. Also, Jonathan went to the federal courthouse to run background checks on the computers there. Jonathan says he wasn\u0027t one of those kids who read detective books and stories about g-men and dreamed of being a private eye.",
            "[PHONE RINGING]",
            "Finally, she pulls into a strip mall. She parks. We park a little down the way. Jonathan opens up a map, so we don\u0027t look so suspicious sitting there, though of course, with cameras and tape recorders, we are the most suspicious-looking car imaginable. Then he pulls out binoculars, which only helps the whole effect.",
            "And sitting there, suddenly, I realize I have no idea what is about to happen. The woman is sitting in front of a store like the same kind of store she works for. So, I think, perhaps it is possible she is going to be meeting friends who she knows from her job. On the other hand, all the women back at her job left separately in separate cars at separate times. So could they really be going out together?",
            "Why were we at this strip mall? Where were we headed next? In most jobs, you know pretty much what is going to happen when you arrive at work that morning. And it occurred to me at that moment that for Jonathan, that is simply not true.",
            "I got to tell you, you\u0027re blowing the premise for my story. I was going to come out with you. I was going to say, well, this private investigative work, you think it\u0027s really glamorous and really interesting if you see it on TV and the movies. But really, if you hang around with the guys, it\u0027s kind of boring. But now, I\u0027m out with you, and I think I\u0027m wrong. It is actually pretty interesting.",
            "And at that moment, the car we\u0027re following pulls out, and we pursue. And then she does something kind of strange, actually. She pulls into an alley. And she waits.",
            "Yeah. Do you think she\u0027s trying to lose us?",
            "We can\u0027t follow her without her noticing. So we circle the block. She backs up, then drives back into the alley. Then she circles the block.",
            "And finally we solve the mystery of what she\u0027s doing. Jonathan, the trained detective, is the one who figures this out. She is not on to us. She\u0027s looking for a parking space. She gets out of the car, heads into a restaurant. It\u0027s a big, cheap, family-style restaurant.",
            "You know something, I don\u0027t think that she\u0027s having an affair. And I tell you why. It\u0027s because if you were having an affair with somebody, you would not go to this particular restaurant. It\u0027s just not romantic enough.",
            "If you were out really for sex with somebody, and you\u0027ve only got a couple hours, you\u0027re not going to go here.",
            "But looked at another way, maybe she is going to be meet a guy here, quickly, where no one would suspect them.",
            "I feel like I keep just going back and forth on whether I think that she\u0027s seeing somebody. Are you doing that, too, or are you--",
            "In fact, Jonathan got into detective work by accident. His father was a lawyer. And from the time Jonathan was 19, he\u0027d go out for his dad, take pictures to use as evidence, track people down so they could be served legal papers. And from there, it wasn\u0027t much of a leap to a real job as a detective.",
            "You\u0027re neutral.",
            "Yeah, I know. But from moment to moment, don\u0027t you feel like you decide, \"Yes, she must be. No, no, she can\u0027t be. Yes, she must be. No, she can\u0027t be\"?",
            "Come on.",
            "And so we head into the restaurant. Jonathan leaves his cameras and his notepads in the car. I leave my tape recorder. Jonathan says we\u0027d be too conspicuous with that stuff.",
            "And when we walk in, we\u0027re pretty much convinced that she is meeting girlfriends from work, just like she told her husband. So we go in. And we spot her right away in a booth with a man.",
            "The way the restaurant is laid out, we can sit at the bar with our back to the couple and then watch everything they do in this big, plate glass mirror that\u0027s behind the bar. They don\u0027t serve Cherry Diet Coke at this bar. So Jonathan orders a regular Diet Coke. And we sit there.",
            "His cell phone rings. And it\u0027s the woman\u0027s husband. Jonathan gives him the news this way. He says, very quietly, \"Apparently, your suspicions were correct.\" The husband gets angry, which Jonathan says is unusual. For some reason, men in this situation, when they get this news, usually cry. Women get angry, in Jonathan\u0027s experience.",
            "Now he\u0027s 29, dressed for work in a black T-shirt and jeans, his hair starting to thin, but just long enough to be pulled into a little ponytail. A steady supply of Newport Lights and Diet Cherry Cokes gets him through the day. And unlike the hard-boiled detectives that you see in the movies, Jonathan Rosenberg is strikingly uncynical. The main impression that you get when you meet him is a decent, level-headed guy, someone who\u0027ll talk straight with you, treat you fairly. It\u0027s an impression that comes in handy in his line of work.",
            "I watch the couple in the mirror. She\u0027s telling the guy a story, gesturing with her hands. He laughs. And I think, \"You have no idea what\u0027s about to hit you.\"",
            "I watch. Someday, that woman\u0027s going to look back on this night. And she\u0027ll think, \"So when I drove to the restaurant, when I was driving there, I was being followed. When we sat talking that night, we were being watched. And I didn\u0027t know.\"",
            "She\u0027ll try to picture it, put it together in her mind. Where was the detective? Where did he wait? Where did he sit? What did he see her do?",
            "In the mirror, Jonathan and I watch the woman get a call on her cellular phone. And she pulls back a little bit from the man who she\u0027s with and withdraw into herself a little bit, talks on the phone. And we wonder, is that her husband? Is he just messing with her?",
            "She talks and hangs up. 30 seconds later, Jonathan\u0027s cell phone rings. It was him. He was messing with her.",
            "He\u0027s like, \"So, are you out with the girls? Uh-huh. Where are you guys. Yeah, who\u0027s there? What are you guys talking about?\" \"That lying bitch,\" he said to Jonathan. For some reason, it\u0027s hard at this moment to feel much sympathy for him.",
            "I have to tell you about the strangest thing about this entire scene. And that is that there\u0027s no sex vibe between these two people. In fact, the man is shoveling food in his mouth with a kind of circular motion of his hand that is the least sexy thing possible. It\u0027s just crude.",
            "You watch him, and you think, \"She is not going to bed with you, if you\u0027re going to eat like that.\" And in fact, when they come out of the restaurant, they go their separate ways without even a kiss, without a hug. Jonathan snaps a few pictures of them outside.",
            "We follow the guy home, get his license plate numbers, get his address. It\u0027s an unusual case, because 90% of the time, Jonathan says, when somebody suspects the spouse of having an affair, the detective catches them the first time out. This case, he\u0027s not very sure what\u0027s going on. He follows the woman for five more days, over $1,000 worth of surveillance, before finally, he catches her actually going home with the guy. In the car, later, I ask him if his job ever gives him the creeps, following people around, secretly watching them in these vulnerable moments, photographing them and videotaping them, gathering evidence that will probably destroy their marriages.",
            "Day two. The first thing you have to do before you go on surveillance, Jonathan tells me, is fill up the gas tank. You don\u0027t know how far you\u0027re going to have to drive tailing people.",
            "Jonathan\u0027s actually a newlywed. He\u0027s been married for only eight months. And he says, yes, having this job has affected his view of marriage.",
            "You were saying when we were inside that you guys joke about it, in fact.",
            "As for me, for the next few days after the surveillance, I had this experience I have never had in my life. I was completely suspicious of everyone. At one point, I was waiting for somebody outside a McDonald\u0027s. And a guy in a black Corolla zooms in, just tears into the parking lot, tears around the curve, pulls into a space.",
            "And I don\u0027t know why, I felt like, \"OK. I better start taking notes.\" I have them, right here. \"Man wore sunglasses, has crew cut. Loud music blares from car. Jumps out, beefy guy, gives me suspicious look. I give him suspicious look.\" And then below here, on the notes, I have his license plate number, just in case.",
            "About 40% of Jonathan\u0027s business is surveillance work on domestic cases, people who think their spouses are cheating on them. The rest of his work is accident investigations, tracking people down, serving them legal papers, and then various insurance and unemployment fraud cases. Today\u0027s client is a husband who\u0027s become suspicious of his wife and was willing to put up $50 an hour, plus expenses, to have her followed, 10 hours paid upfront. She\u0027s been going out a lot, with excuses that don\u0027t seem plausible."

Somehow, based on a thousand detective stories, I\u0027d assumed that these would be middle-aged people, mature people, in a marriage that had gone stale over years. But the woman in this photo was 25 years old, beamingly happy, a suburban girl on vacation in Disneyland or someplace like that. And suddenly, it hit me, looking at this picture, the human tragedy of what was about to happen. If she were cheating on her husband, and we caught her, one way or another, her life was about to turn completely upside down, starting tonight."
