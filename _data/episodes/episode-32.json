        "August 7-- I don\u0027t really expect anyone to answer the door of Bob Dole\u0027s house in Russell, Kansas. But I stop by anyway, just to see what might happen. When you travel with Dole, you see the world as it is constructed by the Dole campaign, until you almost forget there is a world outside of it, where people do the unexpected. Indeed, as I reach for the screen door, I half wonder if some SWAT team will leap out of the bushes and haul me back to Bob Dole\u0027s campaign plane, Citizenship, for questioning.",
        "But Dole is a few days behind me. And the neighborhood remains undisturbed by politics. The only sign that I\u0027m in the right place is the faded pink mat beneath my feet. \"Welcome to the home of the Doles,\" it reads. After a single ring, the front door swings open and an elderly woman steps outside.",
        "\"Just cleaning up before Bob gets here,\" she says. It\u0027s Bob Dole\u0027s sister, Gloria, and she\u0027s as matter-of-fact as Dole himself. She then disappears inside, leaving the door open for me to follow. I do.",
        "Bob Dole\u0027s boyhood home-- his official residence, in fact-- is instantly recognizable to anyone who had grandparents in the 1960s. 1960s old-person\u0027s furniture, low-backed lounge chairs; 1960s old-person colors, unnatural shades of green; and 1960s old-person smells, 1940s perfume. Over the roar of the 1960s vacuum cleaner, Gloria opens various drawers and tosses onto various counters items for me to inspect. The drawers contain hundreds of loose photographs of Dole in his youth that neither Gloria nor anyone else has looked at in years. One shot depicts Dole modeling clothes in a fashion show staged by a local department store. Another shows him shirtless, with his muscles slightly flexed. As a collection, they capture both Dole\u0027s natural obedience-- he always poses-- and his intense physical vanity. How many 18-year-olds in 1940 lifted weights?",
        "\"He looks like a movie star,\" I say to Gloria.",
        "\"He was a movie star,\" she says quickly. \"He is a movie star.\"",
        "The whole thing happened so fast, it seems only natural that I\u0027m ransacking the home of the Republican presidential nominee. After a thorough search of the premises, we move on to the garage, passing, beside Dole\u0027s bed, a strange pair of Little Black Sambo rag dolls of the sort they don\u0027t even allow in the South anymore. The inside of the garage is a welter of ancient possessions that have long since ceased to serve any useful purpose-- five-pound cameras, medicine balls, that sort of thing.",
        "The outside is equally unremarkable, save for the jury-rigged system of sausage-shaped weights that Dole used to rebuild his arm after the war. According to Gloria, the contraption has simply hung there for the past 50 years, untouched by time or fate. Dole just likes having it around.",
        "As I watch the white rope spool through the eye of the silver pulley, I realize I am also watching Bob Dole\u0027s campaign in microcosm. Somewhere in America, Dole is either giving a speech or preparing to give a speech in which he invokes the place where I now stand and the things he once did here.",
        "\"Now let\u0027s just take Bob Dole,\" he\u0027ll say, typically. \"Nothing special about me. Grew up in a small town. Dad wears overalls to work every day for 42 years, was proud of it. Grew up in a basement apartment, six of us, to make ends meet, in Russell, Kansas. Didn\u0027t have any money, but we had lots of values.\" Then he will allude artfully to his war wound and his heroic recovery from it.",
        "The insistence on the importance of events that have occurred 50 years ago in a place where he hasn\u0027t lived for 35 years is more than a little strange. It\u0027s as if Dole has made a bargain with himself, and with those who would judge him, which enables him to cease all serious self-examination after the age of 25. The deal is something like this. Dole agrees to believe that it was worth it to have his arm and his vanity shattered for the sake of his country. In return, the country agrees not to question what lurks inside him. Thanks to a single decision he made 50 years ago, he is forever the war hero. It\u0027s a strangely stunted view of 73 years on the planet.",
        "Morry Taylor asks me to meet him in the parking lot by the San Diego Convention Center. But the convention center is closed and the police who surround it have no idea where to find the parking lot. After a half-hour search, I ask a cop if he\u0027s seen 5,000 people on Harley-Davidson motorcycles-- the number Morry promised to deliver to the Dole campaign. The police officer looks at me as if I am mad.",
        "\"How many?\" he asks incredulously.",
        "\"5,000,\" I say.",
        "\"There is no way you get 5,000 motorcycles anywhere near here,\" he says. For the first time since I met him seven months ago, I doubt Morry\u0027s ability to throw a party. How do you find 5,000 bikers anyway?",
        "Soon enough, I find the parking lot. It lies directly behind a small cluster of protesters, a half mile or so from the convention center. It consists of maybe four acres of concrete at the back of which is a stage. Over the stage is an American flag. And in front of the flag is a huge banner. It reads, \"Titan-- America\u0027s Newest Tire Company.\" That\u0027s Morry\u0027s company.",
        "On the stage are five large black men playing loud instruments, each of whom wears a bandanna that says, \"The Grizz.\" That\u0027s Morry.",
        "At the front of the stage, with a cigar jutting straight out from his mouth, gyrating slightly to the funk, is Morry.",
        "The roar of approaching motorcycles soon drowns out everything. Not 5,000, but 7,000 motorcycles are streaming across a bridge. They are ridden by 7,000 Republicans and led by half the United States Congress and various local bigwigs-- Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Dick Armey. But from the moment the bikers arrive at the gates, the Dole campaign ensures that pretty much everything goes wrong. Dole\u0027s promise to attend causes the police to keep 6,800 bikers out on the highway. Letting them in will prove too much of a security risk, they say.",
        "The thick line dutifully comes to a halt. And the bikers wait restlessly. The Dole campaign goes back and forth until everyone involved is thoroughly unhappy. An hour or so later, the Dole campaign finally admits that Dole won\u0027t be coming. The effect is immediate. The senators and congressmen vanish. As the politicians exit out the back gate, the 3,000 or so bikers who remain on the highway enter through the front.",
        "Morry claims that most of the bikers are actually doctors and lawyers. But these are doctors and lawyers with wild, big bellies and long facial hair. To a man, they are covered in patches that identify them as ardent champions of the American way. Their most popular cause, by far, is the Vietnam War. Everyone is either a veteran or a friend of a veteran. \"Hanoi Jane-- traitor by choice, commie by injection,\" reads a typical armband.",
        "The event quickly degenerates into an enjoyable experience. The glee on Morry\u0027s face as the bikers-- he\u0027s already calling them \"my bikers\"-- roar into the lot calls to mind a small child on Christmas morning. The bikers, for their part, seem thrilled, especially when Morry moonwalks across the stage and hurls Grizz T-shirts into the raucous crowd. As he does, the band strikes up a new song, \"It\u0027s your thing, do what you gotta to. I can\u0027t tell you what not to do.\"",
        "Five hours later, I sit behind Ollie North\u0027s family watching Pat Buchanan take the stage at a rally in Escondido. Buchanan is going to remain inside the Republican Party. That much we know from the advance copies of the speech distributed by his staff. What we don\u0027t know is how his followers will take the news.",
        "One moment at the start of the ceremony speaks volumes about what Buchanan\u0027s followers are up to, as opposed to what Buchanan claims he\u0027s up to. After the Pledge of Allegiance, a claque at the back of the room tacks on a pro-life appendix. \"Born and unborn,\" they shout. When I express astonishment that they have dared to amend the Pledge of Allegiance, a fellow journalist gives me a where-have-you-been look and explains that they\u0027ve also rewritten \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to incorporate some pro-life language.",
        "Nothing illustrates so well how anti-conservative Buchanan\u0027s movement truly is. Its goal is not to conserve the past but to advance a radical agenda. The constant invocation of the past-- the founding fathers, the declaration, et cetera, is more of a smokescreen than anything else. Given this, it will be difficult to yoke these people to an old-fashioned conservative cause like the Dole campaign. It\u0027s like trying to transform a lightning bolt into usable current. That\u0027s Dole\u0027s real problem here. Temperamentally, he\u0027s a conservative. Every fiber in his body is intent on denying anything radical from ever again changing his life.",
        "By late afternoon I finally find Morry again, wandering the convention floor. He looks surprised whenever anyone recognizes him. One Fox television crew even stopped to interview him.",
        "\"Mr. Taylor,\" began the reporter.",
        "\"What do you mean with this \u0027Mr. Taylor\u0027 [BEEP]?\" asked Morry.",
        "\"Morry?\" said the reporter uncertainly.",
        "\"The Grizz,\" boomed Morry.",
        "I tell him that just a few hours earlier, a man named Ed Harrison took the podium and started his speech with the immortal words, \"Now, I\u0027m not a politician and I\u0027m not a lawyer. I\u0027m a businessman.\" He had stolen Morry\u0027s precise words. This, too, Morry can\u0027t quite believe. He hasn\u0027t entirely grasped the power of the modern media.",
        "I have decided it\u0027s finally time to leave him, and I\u0027m wondering how to break the news. The Taylor campaign has come to an end, at least for the moment. I have forgotten the general rule of American politics-- if you hang with Morry Taylor, the action will follow. The rule continues to obtain. We\u0027re sitting in the section reserved for the primary candidates, when Pat Buchanan appears for the first time on the convention floor. He\u0027s already got maybe 50 journalists with him. He quickly accumulates another 100, plus several hundred delegates keen to shake his hand.",
        "The result is a human tsunami that breaks across about a third of the conventional hall and lays waste to anything in its path. \"People are being trampled,\" an enormous security guard shouts into his wrist mic. \"Send me 50 people.\"",
        "The crowd at the convention has its own logic, however. People merely attract more people. For every added security man, three curiosity seekers join in. So as Buchanan circles the hall, the tension rises. He\u0027s like a ball bearing in a roulette wheel trying to decide where to settle. At length, he comes to rest in the seat directly behind Morry. Fully one third of the convention is watching him and ignoring George W. Bush, who is speaking piously from the podium.",
        "\"Open up a child daycare center at your church or synagogue.\" That sort of thing.",
        "\"I need more help here,\" blares the guard into his wrist. \"Send help. Send help.\"",
        "Then Buchanan notices Morry. \"Morry Taylor is the problem here,\" he shouts mockingly. \"He\u0027s ruined the convention.\"",
        "\"Did they do this to you when you got here, Morry?\" shouts Bay Buchanan, joining her brother and ganging up on Morry. It seems needlessly cruel. Morry stands alone watching.",
        "\"It\u0027s you, Pat,\" says Morry. \"Leave Shelley with me and take these people out in the street.\"",
        "The two former rivals vie to condescend to one another. Buchanan is winning on points until he pushes it one inch too far.",
        "\"Where\u0027s the keg, Morry?\" he shouts. \"Go get the keg.\"",
        "Morry looks up, licks his lip and says, \"Hey, Pat, you\u0027re unemployed now.\" Then he turns to the cameras. \"He needs a job,\" Morry explains to the world\u0027s news media. \"Or else he\u0027ll have to take unemployment.\"",
        "Gerald Ford and George Bush speak. But no one around Buchanan listens. All eyes focus on the troublemaker who is giving serial interviews to the networks. At last, Nancy Reagan appears to eulogize Ronny, which is strange. Republicans behave as if he has already died, whereas Nixon, who has actually died, is treated as if he were still alive. She is followed by Colin Powell.",
        "Then comes what I am sure will be the defining moment of the convention. Powell raises his voice above the crowd and proclaims his belief in abortion rights. The convention rises to its feet to applaud. I turn around and meet Buchanan\u0027s gaze.",
        "\"Any reaction?\" I ask idiotically. In these circumstances it is, as a rule, impossible to think of a decent question.",
        "\"What?\" he says.",
        "\"Any reaction?\" I shout. But the noise from the crowd is too loud.",
        "Just in front of Morry, oddly enough, there is a man dressed in a monk\u0027s robe. On the back of the robe is a sign. It reads, \"Diogenes went through the streets carrying a lantern. He held it up to strangers and said he was looking for an honest man.\"",
        "Dole has invited Morry to join him on the stage Thursday night. But Morry has, for the second time in as many days, declined Dole\u0027s invitation. He figures it will merely be another meaningless free-for-all with everyone who ever thought of running for office crammed on to the stage. Although Morry\u0027s aides plead with me to try to change his mind, I can\u0027t honestly tell him he\u0027s wrong. It\u0027s nothing personal, though he\u0027s still irritated that Dole lacked the sense to address 7,000 raving loyalists on motorcycles. It\u0027s just that convention life is less than it\u0027s cracked up to be, he\u0027s decided. In the morning his plane will take him and his friends to Las Vegas."

So as Buchanan circles the hall, the tension rises. He\u0027s like a ball bearing in a roulette wheel trying to decide where to settle. At length, he comes to rest in the seat directly behind Morry. Fully one third of the convention is watching him and ignoring George W. Bush, who is speaking piously from the podium.",
        "By late afternoon I finally find Morry again, wandering the convention floor. He looks surprised whenever anyone recognizes him. One Fox television crew even stopped to interview him.",
        "\"Any reaction?\" I ask idiotically. In these circumstances it is, as a rule, impossible to think of a decent question.",
        "\"There is no way you get 5,000 motorcycles anywhere near here,\" he says. For the first time since I met him seven months ago, I doubt Morry\u0027s ability to throw a party. How do you find 5,000 bikers anyway?",
        "Dole has invited Morry to join him on the stage Thursday night. But Morry has, for the second time in as many days, declined Dole\u0027s invitation. He figures it will merely be another meaningless free-for-all with everyone who ever thought of running for office crammed on to the stage. Although Morry\u0027s aides plead with me to try to change his mind, I can\u0027t honestly tell him he\u0027s wrong. It\u0027s nothing personal, though he\u0027s still irritated that Dole lacked the sense to address 7,000 raving loyalists on motorcycles. It\u0027s just that convention life is less than it\u0027s cracked up to be, he\u0027s decided. In the morning his plane will take him and his friends to Las Vegas.",
        "Gerald Ford and George Bush speak. But no one around Buchanan listens. All eyes focus on the troublemaker who is giving serial interviews to the networks. At last, Nancy Reagan appears to eulogize Ronny, which is strange. Republicans behave as if he has already died, whereas Nixon, who has actually died, is treated as if he were still alive. She is followed by Colin Powell.",
        "August 7-- I don\u0027t really expect anyone to answer the door of Bob Dole\u0027s house in Russell, Kansas. But I stop by anyway, just to see what might happen. When you travel with Dole, you see the world as it is constructed by the Dole campaign, until you almost forget there is a world outside of it, where people do the unexpected. Indeed, as I reach for the screen door, I half wonder if some SWAT team will leap out of the bushes and haul me back to Bob Dole\u0027s campaign plane, Citizenship, for questioning.",
        "\"Just cleaning up before Bob gets here,\" she says. It\u0027s Bob Dole\u0027s sister, Gloria, and she\u0027s as matter-of-fact as Dole himself. She then disappears inside, leaving the door open for me to follow. I do.",
        "\"What?\" he says.",
        "At the front of the stage, with a cigar jutting straight out from his mouth, gyrating slightly to the funk, is Morry.",
        "Just in front of Morry, oddly enough, there is a man dressed in a monk\u0027s robe. On the back of the robe is a sign. It reads, \"Diogenes went through the streets carrying a lantern. He held it up to strangers and said he was looking for an honest man.\"",
        "\"Any reaction?\" I shout. But the noise from the crowd is too loud.",
        "Five hours later, I sit behind Ollie North\u0027s family watching Pat Buchanan take the stage at a rally in Escondido. Buchanan is going to remain inside the Republican Party. That much we know from the advance copies of the speech distributed by his staff. What we don\u0027t know is how his followers will take the news."

      "statements": [
        "Hello, my name is Dan Savage and I am the Republican Party in my neighborhood. I am the Republican Precinct Committee Officer, PCO, for Precinct 1846 in the 43rd District in Seattle, Washington. If you have any questions about the Republican Party, our platform, or any of our candidates, feel free to give me a call.",
        "Now you\u0027re probably wondering how a commie, pinko, drag-fag, sex advice columnist found a home in the hate-mongering, gay-bashing, neo-fascist Republican Party. Well, let me tell you something, pal-- the Republican Party is a big tent, a huge tent. There were no ideological litmus tests at the Republican Party caucuses or conventions that I attended. I didn\u0027t have to produce a voter registration card, or a picture ID even, at my very first caucus-- a measure, I believe, of the respect the Republican Party has for the rights of the individual. I just walked through the door, signed on the dotted line-- Dan Savage certifies that he/she considers himself/herself a Republican-- and that was it. Who knew that going over to the dark side could be so simple?",
        "A couple of weeks after I\u0027d traveled over to the dark side, Daniel Mead Smith, chairman of the 43rd Republican Party, wrote me a letter. \"I think you\u0027ll be surprised that the hate-mongering, gay-bashing, neo-fascist Republican Party does not exist in the 43rd,\" Smith wrote. \"I invite you to come to one of our meetings and see for yourself.\" So I went to one of Smith\u0027s meetings to see for myself, the 43rd District Republican Caucus.",
        "I arrived at the Montlake Community Center for the 1996 43rd District Republican Caucuses at 8:00 AM. I paid my $5, signed in, grabbed a seat, and waited for the work to begin. We were there to elect delegates to the State Republican Convention coming up Memorial Day weekend and vote on non-binding resolutions. The caucus began with a prayer. We asked God to guide us in selecting delegates. And then we were ready to pledge allegiance to the flag. Only trouble was, no one brought a flag. I thought about suggesting we pledge allegiance to the fag-- hey that\u0027s me-- but I didn\u0027t want to be disruptive. Someone found some red, white, and blue bunting in the back room, tossed it over an easel, and we pledged allegiance to that. The easel was needed post-pledge. So the red, white, and blue bunting to which we had just pledged our allegiance was tossed on the floor.",
        "We had to elect delegates before we could get to the resolutions. I won\u0027t bore you with the Robert\u0027s Rules of Order stuff or the impossibly convoluted process by which the 80 of us in that cramped, steeple-roofed, fluorescent-lit room elected 17 delegates to the State Republican Convention. Suffice to say, it was crushingly dull. To entertain us while we waited for the ballots to be counted four times, Republican Party activists and candidates gave little speeches. Some of these speeches were pure fantasy. One woman read a prepared speech about the United Nations working in concert with abortionists to take over the country.",
        "The other recurring fantasy had to do with us, the 43rd District Republicans, retaking the 43rd for the Republican Party. One man reminisced about the time, not too long ago, when the 43rd was a solidly Republican district. \"We can make this district Republican again, just like it was when I joined the party 25 years ago. All we have to do is get out there and doorbell and identify the voters in this district who are sympathetic to our issues.\"",
        "Heart pounding, I stuck my hand in the air. \"Have any of you been out of the house or walked down Broadway in the last 25 years?\" I asked, standing and looking around at the toughest crowd I\u0027ve probably ever played. The 43rd District, I pointed out, had gone all gay all of a sudden. So long as the Republican Party was identified with homophobes and anti-gay, bigot activists, the Republican Party could kiss the 43rd District goodbye.",
        "When I sat down, a little old lady sitting behind me pointed out that she knew a very nice gay couple in the Republican Party. In other words, she, and by extension the party, was not homophobic. And I was wrong.",
        "She said to me, \"The party isn\u0027t against gay people. That\u0027s just a false impression you have.\" Gee, I wonder where I could have picked up that false impression? Maybe from Jesse Helms, Bob Dornan, Bob \"$1,000\" Dole, anti-gay rights rallies in Iowa during the primaries attended by all the Republican presidential hopefuls-- even moderate Lamar Alexander-- Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Newt Gingrich, Linda Smith, Ellen Craswell, Spokane County Coroner Dexter Amend, the Washington State Legislature, state legislatures all across the country, the Christian Coalition.",
        "During a break, an attractive middle-aged man approached me. He was a little angry. \"I was offended by you forcing me to take responsibility for Jesse Helms.\" As if the Republican Party isn\u0027t responsible for Jesse Helms. One woman wanted to know why she should support gay people since gay people didn\u0027t support her when her home was burned down by arsonists. The arsonists weren\u0027t gay or anything. But where were gay people when she needed them? Another pointed out that some gays had broken the windows of the Republican Party headquarters, so who\u0027s oppressing who?",
        "Another man took me aside during a break to let me know that the gay bashing within the Republican Party wasn\u0027t for real. It was only to get out the vote and motivate the front lines. Well, then, I guess that makes it OK. I\u0027m happy to be vilified and scapegoated and denied my civil rights, so long as it motivates people to go to the polls. Disenfranchisement is a small price to pay to increase voter turnout.",
        "A few weeks later, the big day arrived. The King County Republican Convention, my first major party function-- hats, speeches, amendments. I bounded out of bed at 7:00 AM, and ran to meet my new friend, Steve, at the QFC on Broadway. Steve attended his precinct caucuses way back in March with the intention of getting himself elected a delegate to the county and state Republican conventions. Like me, he joined the Republican Party out of a sincere desire to move the GOP to the center. Kindred spirits, we decided to attend the county convention together.",
        "The doors opened at 7:30 AM. After the crowd settled down, a preacher read an alarming opening invocation which pretty much set the tone for what was to come. \"Please forgive our leaders for endorsing perversion. And God, deliver us from spineless compromise.\" Then we bellowed the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. I slipped up to the merchandise tables on the second floor where I bought myself a red, white, and blue \"Craswell for Governor\" hat.",
        "It must have been fate. On my way back down from the merchandise tables, I ran smack dab into Ellen Craswell herself. I said hello, and looking very serious in my little red, white, and blue hat asked, \"What are we going to do about the homosexual problem, Miss Craswell? What is the final solution to all this homosexual nonsense?\"",
        "\"So long as they stay inside, we can let them alone,\" Ellen Craswell confided in me. \"But when they organize and demand special rights, we must oppose them. We can\u0027t give special rights to something that is an abomination in the eyes of God.\"",
        "Now, Ellen didn\u0027t seem interested in elaborating on just what it is we\u0027re supposed to stay inside of-- the closet, our apartments, the priesthood. So I said goodbye, promising to vote for her in the primary. You see, the better Ellen does in the primary, the better the Democratic candidate for governor will do in the fall.",
        "I made it back to the convention floor just in time for the opening of debate on the party platform. The King County Republican Platform is a document drawn up by committee that lays out what the King County Republican Party stands for. And here\u0027s the beautiful part-- delegates are allowed to propose amendments. Once an amendment is proposed, the amendment\u0027s sponsor is allowed to speak, followed by a few people in favor, a few opposed. After that, the sponsor gets another minute or so to address the floor. I was a delegate. I had amendments. And so I would get to address the convention over and over and over again. And as amendments are time-consuming, determined delegates can grind the convention to a halt.",
        "The first section we were to vote on was the preamble, in which we acknowledged God to be our creator and the family as the foundation of our culture. We embraced free markets, recognized that tax and regulatory burdens are a threat to our freedoms, yadda, yadda, yadda. Before we could vote on the preamble-- and it hadn\u0027t occurred to me to amend the preamble-- a delegate proposed that a line be added stating that the party was open to all who accept its basic principles, regardless of race, religion, sex, or national origin.",
        "After debate, the first resolution of the day passed by a distressingly narrow margin. Race, creed, sex, national origin-- something was missing.",
        "Steve approached the microphone and proposed that the just-passed amendment also be amended to include the words \"sexual orientation.\" Well, Steve\u0027s amendment was soundly defeated by a voice vote that, though untabulated, sounded to me like 1,589 to 11. Then the liberty section was up for a vote.",
        "I dashed to a microphone wearing my Ellen Craswell hat and proposed this amendment. \"As respect for the rights of the individual are the bedrock of Republican values, the King County Republican Party hereby recognizes the fundamental human rights of gay and lesbian American citizens. We reject elements on the fringe of the Republican Party that would exploit fear and hatred of gay and lesbian American citizens for short-term political gain.\"",
        "Through the shouting, I pointed out that we King County Republicans can\u0027t have it both ways. We can\u0027t say in one breath that we oppose discrimination and with our next breath, support discrimination against gay and lesbian American citizens. So let\u0027s vote on it. Do we, the Republicans of King County, recognize the fundamental rights of gay and lesbian American citizens, or do we not? Well, we do not. After some heated debate-- the names I was called-- pervert, sodomite, Democrat-- my amendment was voted down.",
        "After my amendment failed, a woman in a Craswell hat approached me. \"Why are you wearing that hat?\" she briskly inquired.",
        "\"Because I\u0027m for Craswell.\"",
        "\"You know where she stands on gay things, don\u0027t you?\" Having recently had a conversation with Ellen herself, I most certainly did.",
        "\"But I\u0027m not,\" I smilingly inform my new friend and fellow Craswell supporter, \"a single-issue voter.\"",
        "Try to imagine now that you\u0027re a homophobic, Republican jerk-off-- which might be a triple redundancy-- at your county convention. You came for the speeches, an anti-Clinton T-shirt for your collection, and a hot dog. This is what you do for fun. Woohoo. But these three guys keep introducing pro-gay-rights amendments, moving to have anti-gay amendments struck, and generally messing with your afternoon.",
        "You didn\u0027t come to the convention to defend your party\u0027s homophobia. And you certainly didn\u0027t come expecting to listen to gay men giving speeches all day long. Who are these guys? And why is that one wearing a Craswell hat? OK, you\u0027re this person. What do you do? You get mad-- very, very mad.",
        "One delegate decided to get even. In what can only be described as a David Lynch moment, a palsied delegate staggered up to the microphone and proposed a change in the rules. No further discussion of homosexuality allowed. His resolution needed a 2/3 majority to pass because it was a rules change, not a simple amendment. And pass it did, to hoots and hollers and cheers.",
        "But we had yet to vote on the education section, which contained a plank about homosexuality. When we got to education, all hell broke loose. Robert\u0027s Rules of Order fetishists leapt to their feet insisting that the anti-gay plank in the Education section would have to be struck. If we can\u0027t discuss homosexuality, we can\u0027t vote on it, for voting is a discussion. Uh-oh, we were talking about homosexuality again. People were booing, shouting. Oh, the humanity.",
        "The chair, bringing the room to order, calmly ruled that the no-further-discussion resolution applied only to pro-gay discussions. We could discuss homosexuality, he said, but only if we weren\u0027t saying anything nice about it. And the convention limped to a close, most of the day having been wasted debating gay rights, gay marriage, what makes people gay, and my hat.",
        "What I learned. Here\u0027s what I learned about Republicans that weekend. They don\u0027t like homos very much. They certainly don\u0027t like having to talk about us. And they certainly like listening to us even less. But they do like beating up on us in their platforms. So King County Republicans, I\u0027ll make you a deal. Leave us out of your platform in \u002798-- the next convention cycle-- and I\u0027ll stay away from your convention. But if we\u0027re in the platform, I intend to return."

        "We had to elect delegates before we could get to the resolutions. I won\u0027t bore you with the Robert\u0027s Rules of Order stuff or the impossibly convoluted process by which the 80 of us in that cramped, steeple-roofed, fluorescent-lit room elected 17 delegates to the State Republican Convention. Suffice to say, it was crushingly dull. To entertain us while we waited for the ballots to be counted four times, Republican Party activists and candidates gave little speeches. Some of these speeches were pure fantasy. One woman read a prepared speech about the United Nations working in concert with abortionists to take over the country.",
        "It must have been fate. On my way back down from the merchandise tables, I ran smack dab into Ellen Craswell herself. I said hello, and looking very serious in my little red, white, and blue hat asked, \"What are we going to do about the homosexual problem, Miss Craswell? What is the final solution to all this homosexual nonsense?\"",
        "Now you\u0027re probably wondering how a commie, pinko, drag-fag, sex advice columnist found a home in the hate-mongering, gay-bashing, neo-fascist Republican Party. Well, let me tell you something, pal-- the Republican Party is a big tent, a huge tent. There were no ideological litmus tests at the Republican Party caucuses or conventions that I attended. I didn\u0027t have to produce a voter registration card, or a picture ID even, at my very first caucus-- a measure, I believe, of the respect the Republican Party has for the rights of the individual. I just walked through the door, signed on the dotted line-- Dan Savage certifies that he/she considers himself/herself a Republican-- and that was it. Who knew that going over to the dark side could be so simple?",
        "Another man took me aside during a break to let me know that the gay bashing within the Republican Party wasn\u0027t for real. It was only to get out the vote and motivate the front lines. Well, then, I guess that makes it OK. I\u0027m happy to be vilified and scapegoated and denied my civil rights, so long as it motivates people to go to the polls. Disenfranchisement is a small price to pay to increase voter turnout.",
        "But we had yet to vote on the education section, which contained a plank about homosexuality. When we got to education, all hell broke loose. Robert\u0027s Rules of Order fetishists leapt to their feet insisting that the anti-gay plank in the Education section would have to be struck. If we can\u0027t discuss homosexuality, we can\u0027t vote on it, for voting is a discussion. Uh-oh, we were talking about homosexuality again. People were booing, shouting. Oh, the humanity.",
        "Hello, my name is Dan Savage and I am the Republican Party in my neighborhood. I am the Republican Precinct Committee Officer, PCO, for Precinct 1846 in the 43rd District in Seattle, Washington. If you have any questions about the Republican Party, our platform, or any of our candidates, feel free to give me a call.",
        "A few weeks later, the big day arrived. The King County Republican Convention, my first major party function-- hats, speeches, amendments. I bounded out of bed at 7:00 AM, and ran to meet my new friend, Steve, at the QFC on Broadway. Steve attended his precinct caucuses way back in March with the intention of getting himself elected a delegate to the county and state Republican conventions. Like me, he joined the Republican Party out of a sincere desire to move the GOP to the center. Kindred spirits, we decided to attend the county convention together.",
        "I arrived at the Montlake Community Center for the 1996 43rd District Republican Caucuses at 8:00 AM. I paid my $5, signed in, grabbed a seat, and waited for the work to begin. We were there to elect delegates to the State Republican Convention coming up Memorial Day weekend and vote on non-binding resolutions. The caucus began with a prayer. We asked God to guide us in selecting delegates. And then we were ready to pledge allegiance to the flag. Only trouble was, no one brought a flag. I thought about suggesting we pledge allegiance to the fag-- hey that\u0027s me-- but I didn\u0027t want to be disruptive. Someone found some red, white, and blue bunting in the back room, tossed it over an easel, and we pledged allegiance to that. The easel was needed post-pledge. So the red, white, and blue bunting to which we had just pledged our allegiance was tossed on the floor.",
        "One delegate decided to get even. In what can only be described as a David Lynch moment, a palsied delegate staggered up to the microphone and proposed a change in the rules. No further discussion of homosexuality allowed. His resolution needed a 2/3 majority to pass because it was a rules change, not a simple amendment. And pass it did, to hoots and hollers and cheers.",
        "During a break, an attractive middle-aged man approached me. He was a little angry. \"I was offended by you forcing me to take responsibility for Jesse Helms.\" As if the Republican Party isn\u0027t responsible for Jesse Helms. One woman wanted to know why she should support gay people since gay people didn\u0027t support her when her home was burned down by arsonists. The arsonists weren\u0027t gay or anything. But where were gay people when she needed them? Another pointed out that some gays had broken the windows of the Republican Party headquarters, so who\u0027s oppressing who?",
        "The first section we were to vote on was the preamble, in which we acknowledged God to be our creator and the family as the foundation of our culture. We embraced free markets, recognized that tax and regulatory burdens are a threat to our freedoms, yadda, yadda, yadda. Before we could vote on the preamble-- and it hadn\u0027t occurred to me to amend the preamble-- a delegate proposed that a line be added stating that the party was open to all who accept its basic principles, regardless of race, religion, sex, or national origin.",
        "You didn\u0027t come to the convention to defend your party\u0027s homophobia. And you certainly didn\u0027t come expecting to listen to gay men giving speeches all day long. Who are these guys? And why is that one wearing a Craswell hat? OK, you\u0027re this person. What do you do? You get mad-- very, very mad.",
        "Heart pounding, I stuck my hand in the air. \"Have any of you been out of the house or walked down Broadway in the last 25 years?\" I asked, standing and looking around at the toughest crowd I\u0027ve probably ever played. The 43rd District, I pointed out, had gone all gay all of a sudden. So long as the Republican Party was identified with homophobes and anti-gay, bigot activists, the Republican Party could kiss the 43rd District goodbye.",
        "A couple of weeks after I\u0027d traveled over to the dark side, Daniel Mead Smith, chairman of the 43rd Republican Party, wrote me a letter. \"I think you\u0027ll be surprised that the hate-mongering, gay-bashing, neo-fascist Republican Party does not exist in the 43rd,\" Smith wrote. \"I invite you to come to one of our meetings and see for yourself.\" So I went to one of Smith\u0027s meetings to see for myself, the 43rd District Republican Caucus.",
        "The chair, bringing the room to order, calmly ruled that the no-further-discussion resolution applied only to pro-gay discussions. We could discuss homosexuality, he said, but only if we weren\u0027t saying anything nice about it. And the convention limped to a close, most of the day having been wasted debating gay rights, gay marriage, what makes people gay, and my hat."

            "At some point during this soiree, someone introduces me to a congressional candidate named Chuck Wojslaw. He\u0027s a retired professor of electronics engineering, running in a mostly Democratic district on the east side of San Jose. Until 10 years ago, he was a Democrat. Now he stands among Republicans in the afternoon sun, wearing a red, white, and blue bicentennial tie. He spent his time at the convention attending seminars run by GOPAC. That\u0027s Newt Gingrich\u0027s former political action committee. And these seminars are on how to be an effective candidate in the last two months of the campaign-- how to do fund-raising, how to manage your time and your people in the last two months, how to respond to the Democratic Party propaganda about Medicare and Medicaid, how to bridge the gender gap, get through to more women.",
            "But don\u0027t they think that one of the reasons why there\u0027s a gender gap isn\u0027t because of the way the Republicans talk about the issues, but because on the specific issues, women, as a group, don\u0027t tend to agree as often with the Republican positions?",
            "Chuck Wojslaw has never run for public office before this. And talking to him, you can tell. He is so much more emotionally present than any normal political candidate who you meet. He looks you in the eye. When you ask him a question, he actually answers the question. And he has none of that robotic, not-quite-human, pod-people affect that many political candidates end up having.",

He seemed completely sincere about what he was doing. We talked for a while. And later, as I was climbing off the boat, I passed him as he huddled with another reporter. He was talking into her tape recorder. It wasn\u0027t hard to overhear. He was telling the same story about his daughter in the same words and the same heartfelt tone.",
            "Monday night, depending on where you sat in the convention hall or which network you happened to be watching, you could clearly hear a mix of boos and cheers when General Colin Powell made his big plea for inclusiveness in the Republican Party. It is unclear how inclusive the party really is or wants to be. One persistent and widespread rumor all week long was that gay Republicans had asked for a block of hotel rooms, for their organization the Log Cabin Republicans, and that the party told them no hotel rooms seemed to be available in San Diego or in the surrounding counties, and booked them rooms over the border in Tijuana. That is, the only acceptable place for them was actually outside the borders of the United States of America. This turned out to be false. Not true at all. But the party\u0027s attitude about including dissenters is so confused that every time it was said, it had the sound of something that actually might be true.",
            "By midweek, everybody knew that inclusion was the word of the week. Everyone was claiming to be inclusive. Even if you were urging people not to yield to others\u0027 beliefs, you did it in the language of inclusion. Witness, for example, Pat Buchanan at a Texas delegation breakfast. To give you the setting here, picture him-- here\u0027s where he\u0027s standing. He\u0027s standing in front of a 20-foot-tall cowboy made entirely of red and black and blue balloons.",
            "What\u0027s it mean to be a Republican, to be a conservative? These questions even extended to the dance floor in San Diego. Early in the week, one of the conservative magazines published, in a special convention issue, an article that questions the kinds of music played at Republican parties. It is, of course, amoral, pop music that does not promote family values, some of it by musicians like the Village People who live a lifestyle the Republican delegates do not approve of.",
            "Well, Wednesday night, the Iowa delegation ended up in a bar called Dick\u0027s Last Resort. This was late. It\u0027s a place with bras strung up over the bar like spoils of war, a big dance floor. And when AC/DC kicked onto the sound system, a sensible-looking delegate named [? Laurie ?] [? Leapholdt, ?] in a sensible skirt, sensible shoes, sensible haircut, wife of a police officer back home, wearing a sticker that said, \"Life of the party\"-- \"life\" in big, red letters-- that many of the right-to-life delegates wore. Anyway, she jumped onto the stage and executed what I have to say is the most incredible display of air guitar work I have seen in my life. Literally, people were cheering. She hurled herself to her knees on the power chords, and she just generally rocked out. When I walked up to her afterwards with my tape recorder and asked where she was from, she replied very quickly, France. But then admitted, no, Des Moines.",

And so we had key speeches during primetime by pro-choice moderates like Colin Powell and Susan Molinari. Well, in addition to all that, the leadership told right-wing advocacy groups, like the National Rifle Association and the right-to-life organizations, that they would not be allowed to set up booths inside the convention hall. So a renegade vice chairman from the California Republican Party named [? Bach ?] [? Pan ?] arranged to have a 70-foot boat docked just outside the convention hall. The hall happens to stand next to a marina. And three times a day, he organized receptions on that boat for different right-wing groups. He stood on the deck and explained."

So he showed up at his local Republican caucus, which in the 43rd is a small group of Republican holdovers in a big gay neighborhood.",
            "And at this point, his story took a surprising turn. Once he arrived, he found out that because he was the only person from the little precinct that he lives in-- each caucus is divided up into a lot of little precincts-- because of that, he was automatically made a precinct committee officer and then automatically won a seat at the county Republican convention. Well, he wrote up the experience that he had at the caucus in the most damning partisan tone humanly possible and published it in the paper. But, as he found out, his adventure had barely begun.",
            "To his surprise, at this meeting, Dan Savage talked the caucus into approving a resolution that affirmed the rights of gays and lesbians and rejected elements of the party who would exploit fear and hatred of homosexuals for short-term political gain. He could not wait, after this victory, to get to the county convention. As an official delegate, Dan Savage would be allowed to vote there. He\u0027d be allowed to make amendments. He would really be allowed to play a role. He planned to vote, in the straw polls they have at these things, for the most conservative Republican candidates-- in this case, Pat Buchanan for president. And for the governor of Washington State, he was going to vote for Ellen Craswell, who opposes gun control, and gay rights, and moral decay, and who he loathes.",

            "Hello, my name is Dan Savage and I am the Republican Party in my neighborhood. I am the Republican Precinct Committee Officer, PCO, for Precinct 1846 in the 43rd District in Seattle, Washington. If you have any questions about the Republican Party, our platform, or any of our candidates, feel free to give me a call.",
            "Now you\u0027re probably wondering how a commie, pinko, drag-fag, sex advice columnist found a home in the hate-mongering, gay-bashing, neo-fascist Republican Party. Well, let me tell you something, pal-- the Republican Party is a big tent, a huge tent. There were no ideological litmus tests at the Republican Party caucuses or conventions that I attended. I didn\u0027t have to produce a voter registration card, or a picture ID even, at my very first caucus-- a measure, I believe, of the respect the Republican Party has for the rights of the individual. I just walked through the door, signed on the dotted line-- Dan Savage certifies that he/she considers himself/herself a Republican-- and that was it. Who knew that going over to the dark side could be so simple?",
            "A couple of weeks after I\u0027d traveled over to the dark side, Daniel Mead Smith, chairman of the 43rd Republican Party, wrote me a letter. \"I think you\u0027ll be surprised that the hate-mongering, gay-bashing, neo-fascist Republican Party does not exist in the 43rd,\" Smith wrote. \"I invite you to come to one of our meetings and see for yourself.\" So I went to one of Smith\u0027s meetings to see for myself, the 43rd District Republican Caucus.",
            "I arrived at the Montlake Community Center for the 1996 43rd District Republican Caucuses at 8:00 AM. I paid my $5, signed in, grabbed a seat, and waited for the work to begin. We were there to elect delegates to the State Republican Convention coming up Memorial Day weekend and vote on non-binding resolutions. The caucus began with a prayer. We asked God to guide us in selecting delegates. And then we were ready to pledge allegiance to the flag. Only trouble was, no one brought a flag. I thought about suggesting we pledge allegiance to the fag-- hey that\u0027s me-- but I didn\u0027t want to be disruptive. Someone found some red, white, and blue bunting in the back room, tossed it over an easel, and we pledged allegiance to that. The easel was needed post-pledge. So the red, white, and blue bunting to which we had just pledged our allegiance was tossed on the floor.",
            "We had to elect delegates before we could get to the resolutions. I won\u0027t bore you with the Robert\u0027s Rules of Order stuff or the impossibly convoluted process by which the 80 of us in that cramped, steeple-roofed, fluorescent-lit room elected 17 delegates to the State Republican Convention. Suffice to say, it was crushingly dull. To entertain us while we waited for the ballots to be counted four times, Republican Party activists and candidates gave little speeches. Some of these speeches were pure fantasy. One woman read a prepared speech about the United Nations working in concert with abortionists to take over the country.",
            "The other recurring fantasy had to do with us, the 43rd District Republicans, retaking the 43rd for the Republican Party. One man reminisced about the time, not too long ago, when the 43rd was a solidly Republican district. \"We can make this district Republican again, just like it was when I joined the party 25 years ago. All we have to do is get out there and doorbell and identify the voters in this district who are sympathetic to our issues.\"",
            "Heart pounding, I stuck my hand in the air. \"Have any of you been out of the house or walked down Broadway in the last 25 years?\" I asked, standing and looking around at the toughest crowd I\u0027ve probably ever played. The 43rd District, I pointed out, had gone all gay all of a sudden. So long as the Republican Party was identified with homophobes and anti-gay, bigot activists, the Republican Party could kiss the 43rd District goodbye.",
            "When I sat down, a little old lady sitting behind me pointed out that she knew a very nice gay couple in the Republican Party. In other words, she, and by extension the party, was not homophobic. And I was wrong.",
            "She said to me, \"The party isn\u0027t against gay people. That\u0027s just a false impression you have.\" Gee, I wonder where I could have picked up that false impression? Maybe from Jesse Helms, Bob Dornan, Bob \"$1,000\" Dole, anti-gay rights rallies in Iowa during the primaries attended by all the Republican presidential hopefuls-- even moderate Lamar Alexander-- Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Newt Gingrich, Linda Smith, Ellen Craswell, Spokane County Coroner Dexter Amend, the Washington State Legislature, state legislatures all across the country, the Christian Coalition.",
            "During a break, an attractive middle-aged man approached me. He was a little angry. \"I was offended by you forcing me to take responsibility for Jesse Helms.\" As if the Republican Party isn\u0027t responsible for Jesse Helms. One woman wanted to know why she should support gay people since gay people didn\u0027t support her when her home was burned down by arsonists. The arsonists weren\u0027t gay or anything. But where were gay people when she needed them? Another pointed out that some gays had broken the windows of the Republican Party headquarters, so who\u0027s oppressing who?",
            "Another man took me aside during a break to let me know that the gay bashing within the Republican Party wasn\u0027t for real. It was only to get out the vote and motivate the front lines. Well, then, I guess that makes it OK. I\u0027m happy to be vilified and scapegoated and denied my civil rights, so long as it motivates people to go to the polls. Disenfranchisement is a small price to pay to increase voter turnout.",
            "A few weeks later, the big day arrived. The King County Republican Convention, my first major party function-- hats, speeches, amendments. I bounded out of bed at 7:00 AM, and ran to meet my new friend, Steve, at the QFC on Broadway. Steve attended his precinct caucuses way back in March with the intention of getting himself elected a delegate to the county and state Republican conventions. Like me, he joined the Republican Party out of a sincere desire to move the GOP to the center. Kindred spirits, we decided to attend the county convention together.",
            "The doors opened at 7:30 AM. After the crowd settled down, a preacher read an alarming opening invocation which pretty much set the tone for what was to come. \"Please forgive our leaders for endorsing perversion. And God, deliver us from spineless compromise.\" Then we bellowed the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. I slipped up to the merchandise tables on the second floor where I bought myself a red, white, and blue \"Craswell for Governor\" hat.",
            "It must have been fate. On my way back down from the merchandise tables, I ran smack dab into Ellen Craswell herself. I said hello, and looking very serious in my little red, white, and blue hat asked, \"What are we going to do about the homosexual problem, Miss Craswell? What is the final solution to all this homosexual nonsense?\"",
            "\"So long as they stay inside, we can let them alone,\" Ellen Craswell confided in me. \"But when they organize and demand special rights, we must oppose them. We can\u0027t give special rights to something that is an abomination in the eyes of God.\"",
            "Now, Ellen didn\u0027t seem interested in elaborating on just what it is we\u0027re supposed to stay inside of-- the closet, our apartments, the priesthood. So I said goodbye, promising to vote for her in the primary. You see, the better Ellen does in the primary, the better the Democratic candidate for governor will do in the fall.",
            "I made it back to the convention floor just in time for the opening of debate on the party platform. The King County Republican Platform is a document drawn up by committee that lays out what the King County Republican Party stands for. And here\u0027s the beautiful part-- delegates are allowed to propose amendments. Once an amendment is proposed, the amendment\u0027s sponsor is allowed to speak, followed by a few people in favor, a few opposed. After that, the sponsor gets another minute or so to address the floor. I was a delegate. I had amendments. And so I would get to address the convention over and over and over again. And as amendments are time-consuming, determined delegates can grind the convention to a halt.",
            "The first section we were to vote on was the preamble, in which we acknowledged God to be our creator and the family as the foundation of our culture. We embraced free markets, recognized that tax and regulatory burdens are a threat to our freedoms, yadda, yadda, yadda. Before we could vote on the preamble-- and it hadn\u0027t occurred to me to amend the preamble-- a delegate proposed that a line be added stating that the party was open to all who accept its basic principles, regardless of race, religion, sex, or national origin.",
            "After debate, the first resolution of the day passed by a distressingly narrow margin. Race, creed, sex, national origin-- something was missing.",
            "Steve approached the microphone and proposed that the just-passed amendment also be amended to include the words \"sexual orientation.\" Well, Steve\u0027s amendment was soundly defeated by a voice vote that, though untabulated, sounded to me like 1,589 to 11. Then the liberty section was up for a vote.",
            "I dashed to a microphone wearing my Ellen Craswell hat and proposed this amendment. \"As respect for the rights of the individual are the bedrock of Republican values, the King County Republican Party hereby recognizes the fundamental human rights of gay and lesbian American citizens. We reject elements on the fringe of the Republican Party that would exploit fear and hatred of gay and lesbian American citizens for short-term political gain.\"",
            "Through the shouting, I pointed out that we King County Republicans can\u0027t have it both ways. We can\u0027t say in one breath that we oppose discrimination and with our next breath, support discrimination against gay and lesbian American citizens. So let\u0027s vote on it. Do we, the Republicans of King County, recognize the fundamental rights of gay and lesbian American citizens, or do we not? Well, we do not. After some heated debate-- the names I was called-- pervert, sodomite, Democrat-- my amendment was voted down.",
            "After my amendment failed, a woman in a Craswell hat approached me. \"Why are you wearing that hat?\" she briskly inquired.",
            "\"Because I\u0027m for Craswell.\"",
            "\"You know where she stands on gay things, don\u0027t you?\" Having recently had a conversation with Ellen herself, I most certainly did.",
            "\"But I\u0027m not,\" I smilingly inform my new friend and fellow Craswell supporter, \"a single-issue voter.\"",
            "Try to imagine now that you\u0027re a homophobic, Republican jerk-off-- which might be a triple redundancy-- at your county convention. You came for the speeches, an anti-Clinton T-shirt for your collection, and a hot dog. This is what you do for fun. Woohoo. But these three guys keep introducing pro-gay-rights amendments, moving to have anti-gay amendments struck, and generally messing with your afternoon.",
            "You didn\u0027t come to the convention to defend your party\u0027s homophobia. And you certainly didn\u0027t come expecting to listen to gay men giving speeches all day long. Who are these guys? And why is that one wearing a Craswell hat? OK, you\u0027re this person. What do you do? You get mad-- very, very mad.",
            "One delegate decided to get even. In what can only be described as a David Lynch moment, a palsied delegate staggered up to the microphone and proposed a change in the rules. No further discussion of homosexuality allowed. His resolution needed a 2/3 majority to pass because it was a rules change, not a simple amendment. And pass it did, to hoots and hollers and cheers.",
            "But we had yet to vote on the education section, which contained a plank about homosexuality. When we got to education, all hell broke loose. Robert\u0027s Rules of Order fetishists leapt to their feet insisting that the anti-gay plank in the Education section would have to be struck. If we can\u0027t discuss homosexuality, we can\u0027t vote on it, for voting is a discussion. Uh-oh, we were talking about homosexuality again. People were booing, shouting. Oh, the humanity.",
            "The chair, bringing the room to order, calmly ruled that the no-further-discussion resolution applied only to pro-gay discussions. We could discuss homosexuality, he said, but only if we weren\u0027t saying anything nice about it. And the convention limped to a close, most of the day having been wasted debating gay rights, gay marriage, what makes people gay, and my hat.",
            "What I learned. Here\u0027s what I learned about Republicans that weekend. They don\u0027t like homos very much. They certainly don\u0027t like having to talk about us. And they certainly like listening to us even less. But they do like beating up on us in their platforms. So King County Republicans, I\u0027ll make you a deal. Leave us out of your platform in \u002798-- the next convention cycle-- and I\u0027ll stay away from your convention. But if we\u0027re in the platform, I intend to return."

We could discuss homosexuality, he said, but only if we weren\u0027t saying anything nice about it.

I didn\u0027t have to produce a voter registration card, or a picture ID even, at my very first caucus-- a measure, I believe, of the respect the Republican Party has for the rights of the individual. I just walked through the door, signed on the dotted line-- Dan Savage certifies that he/she considers himself/herself a Republican-- and that was it.

We were there to elect delegates to the State Republican Convention coming up Memorial Day weekend and vote on non-binding resolutions. The caucus began with a prayer. We asked God to guide us in selecting delegates. And then we were ready to pledge allegiance to the flag. Only trouble was, no one brought a flag. I thought about suggesting we pledge allegiance to the fag-- hey that\u0027s me-- but I didn\u0027t want to be disruptive. Someone found some red, white, and blue bunting in the back room, tossed it over an easel, and we pledged allegiance to that. The easel was needed post-pledge.

            "August 7-- I don\u0027t really expect anyone to answer the door of Bob Dole\u0027s house in Russell, Kansas. But I stop by anyway, just to see what might happen. When you travel with Dole, you see the world as it is constructed by the Dole campaign, until you almost forget there is a world outside of it, where people do the unexpected. Indeed, as I reach for the screen door, I half wonder if some SWAT team will leap out of the bushes and haul me back to Bob Dole\u0027s campaign plane, Citizenship, for questioning.",
            "But Dole is a few days behind me. And the neighborhood remains undisturbed by politics. The only sign that I\u0027m in the right place is the faded pink mat beneath my feet. \"Welcome to the home of the Doles,\" it reads. After a single ring, the front door swings open and an elderly woman steps outside.",
            "\"Just cleaning up before Bob gets here,\" she says. It\u0027s Bob Dole\u0027s sister, Gloria, and she\u0027s as matter-of-fact as Dole himself. She then disappears inside, leaving the door open for me to follow. I do.",
            "Bob Dole\u0027s boyhood home-- his official residence, in fact-- is instantly recognizable to anyone who had grandparents in the 1960s. 1960s old-person\u0027s furniture, low-backed lounge chairs; 1960s old-person colors, unnatural shades of green; and 1960s old-person smells, 1940s perfume. Over the roar of the 1960s vacuum cleaner, Gloria opens various drawers and tosses onto various counters items for me to inspect. The drawers contain hundreds of loose photographs of Dole in his youth that neither Gloria nor anyone else has looked at in years. One shot depicts Dole modeling clothes in a fashion show staged by a local department store. Another shows him shirtless, with his muscles slightly flexed. As a collection, they capture both Dole\u0027s natural obedience-- he always poses-- and his intense physical vanity. How many 18-year-olds in 1940 lifted weights?",
            "\"He looks like a movie star,\" I say to Gloria.",
            "\"He was a movie star,\" she says quickly. \"He is a movie star.\"",
            "The whole thing happened so fast, it seems only natural that I\u0027m ransacking the home of the Republican presidential nominee. After a thorough search of the premises, we move on to the garage, passing, beside Dole\u0027s bed, a strange pair of Little Black Sambo rag dolls of the sort they don\u0027t even allow in the South anymore. The inside of the garage is a welter of ancient possessions that have long since ceased to serve any useful purpose-- five-pound cameras, medicine balls, that sort of thing.",
            "The outside is equally unremarkable, save for the jury-rigged system of sausage-shaped weights that Dole used to rebuild his arm after the war. According to Gloria, the contraption has simply hung there for the past 50 years, untouched by time or fate. Dole just likes having it around.",
            "As I watch the white rope spool through the eye of the silver pulley, I realize I am also watching Bob Dole\u0027s campaign in microcosm. Somewhere in America, Dole is either giving a speech or preparing to give a speech in which he invokes the place where I now stand and the things he once did here.",
            "\"Now let\u0027s just take Bob Dole,\" he\u0027ll say, typically. \"Nothing special about me. Grew up in a small town. Dad wears overalls to work every day for 42 years, was proud of it. Grew up in a basement apartment, six of us, to make ends meet, in Russell, Kansas. Didn\u0027t have any money, but we had lots of values.\" Then he will allude artfully to his war wound and his heroic recovery from it.",
            "The insistence on the importance of events that have occurred 50 years ago in a place where he hasn\u0027t lived for 35 years is more than a little strange.

Over the roar of the 1960s vacuum cleaner, Gloria opens various drawers and tosses onto various counters items for me to inspect. The drawers contain hundreds of loose photographs of Dole in his youth that neither Gloria nor anyone else has looked at in years. One shot depicts Dole modeling clothes in a fashion show staged by a local department store. Another shows him shirtless, with his muscles slightly flexed. As a collection, they capture both Dole\u0027s natural obedience-- he always poses-- and his intense physical vanity. How many 18-year-olds in 1940 lifted weights?",

Over the roar of the 1960s vacuum cleaner, Gloria opens various drawers and tosses onto various counters items for me to inspect. The drawers contain hundreds of loose photographs of Dole in his youth that neither Gloria nor anyone else has looked at in years. One shot depicts Dole modeling clothes in a fashion show staged by a local department store. Another shows him shirtless, with his muscles slightly flexed. As a collection, they capture both Dole\u0027s natural obedience-- he always poses-- and his intense physical vanity. How many 18-year-olds in 1940 lifted weights?"

Dole agrees to believe that it was worth it to have his arm and his vanity shattered for the sake of his country. In return, the country agrees not to question what lurks inside him. Thanks to a single decision he made 50 years ago, he is forever the war hero. It\u0027s a strangely stunted view of 73 years on the planet."

            "\"You\u0027ll see democracy in action,\" Daddy promised. \"Yes, history in the making. You\u0027ll be the only kid in school to see Dick Nixon in person.\"",
            "I wasn\u0027t impressed. I had just seen Soupy Sales at the state fair. And Nixon was only a vice president. Besides, I\u0027d seen his face every morning when I came downstairs for breakfast. Above the fireplace, in a kind of Republican shrine, surrounded by a grey china elephant and a stack of \"I Like Ike\" buttons, hung a photo of my father, John Smith, and Richard Nixon shaking hands. It was taken in 1958 when Nixon was vice president and Daddy was one of nine Young Republican Vice Chairmen.",
            "They are standing toe to toe, wingtip to wingtip, their hands clasped in a no-nonsense handshake. They even look a little alike, same height and build, the same oversize square head, shiny gray suit, intent, unwavering stare. I understand now that these photos were staged for the party faithful. But in 1960, I thought that Dick Nixon and my father were best friends, blood brothers who had cut their palms and clasped them together in a sacred ceremony preserved on film.",
            "Daddy was proud of that photo-- framed it, bragged on it, and made sure his daughters kept it dusted. As far as he was concerned, he and Dick were comrades from the front lines. His old friend was about to be promoted from vice president to president. And we were traveling to Chicago to cheer him on.",
            "We\u0027d been in Chicago a couple of days, and Mother and I still couldn\u0027t get into the convention. Every morning, Daddy had left us waiting while he searched for spectator tickets. When we finally got inside, the seats were in the nosebleed section. I was troubled. If Nixon and my daddy are such good friends, why are we sitting up here?",
            "The next day we were in luck. The Republican women had planned to wear yellow dresses to a demonstration. Mother wore hers and we slipped onto the convention floor. What can I tell you about a convention from the eyes of a 10-year-old? Mostly, I saw belt buckles, breasts, and bellies. Red, white, and blue balloons, the crush of bodies, funny hats, popcorn, the smell of Old Spice and Aqua Velva, grown-ups shouting and pushing like a bunch of kids, crushed toes, Texans in 10-gallon hats, and Goldwater delegates who never gave up trying to make you wear their buttons.",
            "We joined the parade of Republican women marching round and round the floor demonstrating for or against something. Somehow we were spotted as frauds and led through the exit doors and into the midday sun.",
            "The international amphitheater was in the middle of the stockyards. And although most of the slaughterhouses had closed, the smell of death was everywhere. Nearby, Darling and Company, the last of the rendering firms, was boiling down hides, hooves, heads, tails into glue. When the wind was right, you could smell it as far as Hyde Park, four miles away.

And so we had key speeches during primetime by pro-choice moderates like Colin Powell and Susan Molinari. Well, in addition to all that, the leadership told right-wing advocacy groups, like the National Rifle Association and the right-to-life organizations, that they would not be allowed to set up booths inside the convention hall. So a renegade vice chairman from the California Republican Party named [? Bach ?] [? Pan ?] arranged to have a 70-foot boat docked just outside the convention hall. The hall happens to stand next to a marina. And three times a day, he organized receptions on that boat for different right-wing groups. He stood on the deck and explained."

I still haven\u0027t found a political home. This year, the Republican talk about inclusion makes me nervous. They repeat it too often and with too little evidence. But this week, for the first time since 1960, I had a calm political discussion with my father. I was surprised. Although he\u0027s proud of Colin Powell and still likes Republican economics, he feels as left out as I do."

I never did what they told me.\" And for the first time, he explained to me the reason we didn\u0027t get tickets to the convention floor in 1960. The state party leaders wanted him to run for the one office usually reserved for blacks. Instead, he ran for a mainstream position and won. And that\u0027s how we ended up in a vacant lot that smelled of death, pounding on the doors to get in."
