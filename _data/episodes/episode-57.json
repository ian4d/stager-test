All the names of the buildings are like the hub, and the super hub, and the mega hub, and the ultra hub. Anyway so Tabitha Tate stands there, and she has memorized 700 FedEx destination codes. And she stands by a bin of packages, and she grabs one with her left hand and one with her right.

        "A few guys said they\u0027d heard of other guys having sex on their routes. And weirdly, the setting for these events was always the same.",
        "She got in the truck with him?",
        "In the back of the truck. And they had sex.",
        "On the shelf, which brings me to a question. Who are all these people that other people know who like having sex in these places that sound so uncomfortable?",
        "It turns out that asking UPS drivers whether they have sex on their route is pretty much like asking any other group of mostly straight men about sex. Very quickly, you find yourself talking about an elevator, a mirror, or a nymphomaniac.",
        "How come it always happens in the van? I\u0027ve never heard people, where the guy comes into the house. It\u0027s always the woman going into the van.",
        "The bottom line about the whole UPS sex connection, what actually happens to real people-- and this is going to blow your mind-- is that sometimes women ask their UPS man out on a date. An off-hours, let\u0027s have lunch, let\u0027s have dinner, regular kind of date. Just like you and me. And aside from that, with very few exceptions, I believe it is all simply lies.",

        "And I believe I now have the empirical evidence necessary to put everyone\u0027s mind at rest here. UPS delivery guys, as a group, are not having more sex than you are. Here\u0027s how I know. When you ask them what sexual experiences they have personally had while on the job, you instantly get into really boring territory."

        "You knew when the record was beatable because you would be halfway through your route, and, let\u0027s say, you\u0027d done it in 45 minutes. And you knew that if you just gave it a little extra energy that you could get through the day. But I remember one day, OK, I was halfway through my route, and there was this woman in front of me at this intersection. And the light turned yellow, and she slowed down.",
        "And she really could have gone through the yellow light. And I could have gone through, and it would have been perfect. And I had all the lights timed. And she slowed down. And I was sitting in my truck, and I lost it.",
        "And I lost it to the point where before the light turned green, I put it in neutral-- I was on a slight hill-- and I just sort of bumped her. And then immediately, the minute I bumped her, this huge guilt washed over me. And I\u0027m like, \"OK, that was violent. OK, it\u0027s one thing to be screaming and yelling in your truck, listening to Motorhead. It\u0027s another thing to physically violate somebody like that.\" So then I realized, OK, I crossed some line that I guess you just shouldn\u0027t cross.",
        "The psychology, I think, of the delivery driver is that the job is so boring. And it\u0027s stressful. There\u0027s no more stressful job than driving in traffic, especially in an urban environment. And so then it all gets reduced to minutiae.",
        "It gets reduced to this guy who\u0027s in this little car ahead of you, who somehow becomes your archenemy. And so it just creates an environment where you get very hostile and everybody is an inconvenience. And all you want to do is get from point A to point B.",
        "Then there was the one part of delivery job which was always-- there you are. You\u0027re screaming, you\u0027re yelling, or you\u0027re just having these outbursts. And then there\u0027s the beautiful secretary walking to work with the short skirt.",
        "And it would be like this-- all the noise would stop, and you\u0027d just have this momentary calm. And then all of a sudden, she would disappear from view. And then you were thrust right back into the craziness of traffic and trying to get to where you\u0027re going. But that would always save the day, actually.",
        "Everybody had their own routes. And there were sort of expected times that you would finish your routes in. And part of the reasons why we had so many accidents, especially me, was because I was obsessed with doing my route faster than anybody else. And I would literally shave-- I think when I first started the route, I shaved an hour off of-- so instead of doing it in three hours, I would do it in two hours.",
        "But along the way, I would wipe out people\u0027s cars. I wouldn\u0027t talk to the clients. I would drop off the potatoes, and they would try to engage me in a conversation, and all I could think about is, \"Let me just get the hell out of here and get on my way.\"",
        "The way I would shave the time is I ran a lot of red lights. I would drive 65 miles an hour down a city street. It got to the point though where I realized that after, whatever, a year of driving that I was getting into increments of 1 minute, 30 seconds. Literally, I would drive 100 miles an hour into the loading bay, slam on the brakes, and look at the clock.",
        "I remember one day driving along 50 miles an hour down this street. And I see it\u0027s a two lane, one-way street. And I see in the right-hand lane about two blocks ahead of me just your nondescript, white rental car just going along and can\u0027t decide if they want to go right or left. And two blocks away from them, I go, \"If I really wanted to, I could slow down right now because I know they\u0027re going to do something really stupid.\"",
        "But then there was this part of me that said, \"Well, the hell with that. I am on my route. I have to do what I have to do.\" And of course, as I got within 20 feet of them, they decided to turn left from the right lane, right in front of me.",
        "I completely totaled their car. And my first reaction was to get out of the car, and I wanted to yell at them. It wasn\u0027t like, \"You could have prevented this. You saw this coming.\" But it was like, \"You have now slowed me down. You\u0027ve screwed up my whole day.\"",
        "And really, if it wasn\u0027t for this group of PG\u0026E workers, electrical workers, working on the street out there who saw this and somehow decided that I was in the right-- because I guess it was like this blue collar bonding thing, like, \"He\u0027s a truck driver. There is no way these people in this rent-a-car can be right.\"-- I think I would have really gotten into trouble because I obviously was speeding like a maniac. I sort of walked through my whole job that way except the time I ran into the Bank of America building.",
        "You\u0027re in this very surreal world. Nobody else is up. You\u0027re bombing down the streets. I think that\u0027s part of the problem. When all of a sudden people appear on the streets, you\u0027re like, \"Look, I\u0027ve been on the streets already for three hours. Just get out of my way.\""

Even at the very bottom, you meet people like this. Tabitha Tate, for example. She stands in a row of a dozen people who do what\u0027s called the secondary sort for belt two.",
            "I have to say, when you wander around FedEx, they\u0027re constantly telling you things like, OK, here\u0027s the secondary sort, and here\u0027s where the matrix begins, and here\u0027s the other matrix. All the names of the buildings are like the hub, and the super hub, and the mega hub, and the ultra hub. Anyway so Tabitha Tate stands there, and she has memorized 700 FedEx destination codes. And she stands by a bin of packages, and she grabs one with her left hand and one with her right. And she barely glances at them as she pitches them into 10 different destination slots faster than you would think is humanly impossible.",

            "Act Three, the world premiere of a new radio drama by David Sedaris. It\u0027s kind of a radio experiment. We gave him a sound effects record and this challenge, to create a radio play using only the effects on this one record and using all the effects on the record. We hear what he came up with. Act Four, Check Out The Package On That Guy. An investigation into whether UPS men actually do have sex with the customers on their route. Act Five, an unhappy customer gets a phone call from the CEO of Federal Express and still keeps his personal boycott going of the company. Stay with us.",
            "The planes land every 45 seconds or so for two hours, 130 jets here at the Memphis hub of Federal Express. 1.2 million pieces of cargo are unloaded, slid down ramps and conveyor belts, scanned and sorted and rerouted and rescanned by 8,500 people, under lights, in the middle of the night. And three hours after they start, the packages are packed onto planes to their destinations, and the airlift out of Memphis begins. It\u0027s frantic.",
            "Meanwhile, somewhere, probably sleeping, are hundreds of thousands of Americans in one big, big hurry to get their stuff delivered to them on time, in one day. In the middle of the Memphis airport, come midnight, we look like one very anxious nation.",
            "Everywhere around the Federal Express hub, there are television screens with two times on them. One is the current time. The other is the time that the sort will go down, that is, the time that they hope that they will stop taking in new packages. All the planes will be in, all the packages will go in. If everything goes perfectly, good weather, no maintenance problems, the sort goes down at 2:07. And for every minute they go over 2:07, the cost per minute?",
            "That\u0027s employee costs, extra flights to get packages where they\u0027ll need to go, refunds to customers whose packages were delayed because the sort went late. They guy who explained this to me, Ron Nichols, is 31, and he sits in the hot seat himself. A few nights a week, he\u0027s the one who determines when the sort goes down.",
            "If a plane with 50,000 packages is going to be late, should he hold the sort? How long? In 10 minutes, this 31-year-old can cost Federal Express $1 million. He likes the pressure."

            "You knew when the record was beatable because you would be halfway through your route, and, let\u0027s say, you\u0027d done it in 45 minutes. And you knew that if you just gave it a little extra energy that you could get through the day. But I remember one day, OK, I was halfway through my route, and there was this woman in front of me at this intersection. And the light turned yellow, and she slowed down.",
            "And she really could have gone through the yellow light. And I could have gone through, and it would have been perfect. And I had all the lights timed. And she slowed down. And I was sitting in my truck, and I lost it.",
            "And I lost it to the point where before the light turned green, I put it in neutral-- I was on a slight hill-- and I just sort of bumped her. And then immediately, the minute I bumped her, this huge guilt washed over me. And I\u0027m like, \"OK, that was violent. OK, it\u0027s one thing to be screaming and yelling in your truck, listening to Motorhead. It\u0027s another thing to physically violate somebody like that.\" So then I realized, OK, I crossed some line that I guess you just shouldn\u0027t cross.",
            "The psychology, I think, of the delivery driver is that the job is so boring. And it\u0027s stressful. There\u0027s no more stressful job than driving in traffic, especially in an urban environment. And so then it all gets reduced to minutiae.",
            "It gets reduced to this guy who\u0027s in this little car ahead of you, who somehow becomes your archenemy. And so it just creates an environment where you get very hostile and everybody is an inconvenience. And all you want to do is get from point A to point B.",
            "Then there was the one part of delivery job which was always-- there you are. You\u0027re screaming, you\u0027re yelling, or you\u0027re just having these outbursts. And then there\u0027s the beautiful secretary walking to work with the short skirt.",
            "And it would be like this-- all the noise would stop, and you\u0027d just have this momentary calm. And then all of a sudden, she would disappear from view. And then you were thrust right back into the craziness of traffic and trying to get to where you\u0027re going. But that would always save the day, actually.",
            "Everybody had their own routes. And there were sort of expected times that you would finish your routes in. And part of the reasons why we had so many accidents, especially me, was because I was obsessed with doing my route faster than anybody else. And I would literally shave-- I think when I first started the route, I shaved an hour off of-- so instead of doing it in three hours, I would do it in two hours.",
            "But along the way, I would wipe out people\u0027s cars. I wouldn\u0027t talk to the clients. I would drop off the potatoes, and they would try to engage me in a conversation, and all I could think about is, \"Let me just get the hell out of here and get on my way.\"",
            "The way I would shave the time is I ran a lot of red lights. I would drive 65 miles an hour down a city street. It got to the point though where I realized that after, whatever, a year of driving that I was getting into increments of 1 minute, 30 seconds. Literally, I would drive 100 miles an hour into the loading bay, slam on the brakes, and look at the clock.",
            "I remember one day driving along 50 miles an hour down this street. And I see it\u0027s a two lane, one-way street. And I see in the right-hand lane about two blocks ahead of me just your nondescript, white rental car just going along and can\u0027t decide if they want to go right or left. And two blocks away from them, I go, \"If I really wanted to, I could slow down right now because I know they\u0027re going to do something really stupid.\"",
            "But then there was this part of me that said, \"Well, the hell with that. I am on my route. I have to do what I have to do.\" And of course, as I got within 20 feet of them, they decided to turn left from the right lane, right in front of me.",
            "I completely totaled their car. And my first reaction was to get out of the car, and I wanted to yell at them. It wasn\u0027t like, \"You could have prevented this. You saw this coming.\" But it was like, \"You have now slowed me down. You\u0027ve screwed up my whole day.\"",
            "And really, if it wasn\u0027t for this group of PG\u0026E workers, electrical workers, working on the street out there who saw this and somehow decided that I was in the right-- because I guess it was like this blue collar bonding thing, like, \"He\u0027s a truck driver. There is no way these people in this rent-a-car can be right.\"-- I think I would have really gotten into trouble because I obviously was speeding like a maniac. I sort of walked through my whole job that way except the time I ran into the Bank of America building.",
            "You\u0027re in this very surreal world. Nobody else is up. You\u0027re bombing down the streets. I think that\u0027s part of the problem. When all of a sudden people appear on the streets, you\u0027re like, \"Look, I\u0027ve been on the streets already for three hours. Just get out of my way.\""

And just like there\u0027s a euphoria for the people who are under so much pressure at Federal Express in the middle of the night, there\u0027s this euphoria to moving through traffic and racing the clock to get your stuff where it\u0027s supposed to go.

            "Twice this year, Wayne\u0027s cheated on his wife, and I\u0027ve heard it all, the before and the after. The last time, his wife nearly tossed his ass out to the dogs. Neither of the women seemed worth it to me. One of them was even younger than Charlene.",
            "Wayne can be a moody guy, and this is one of those nights. He slouches in the driver\u0027s seat and swerves through traffic, riding other people\u0027s bumpers like I\u0027ve told him not to do. I don\u0027t need a collision or a four-hour silent treatment, so I try to forget that I think his wife is good people and ask him if Charlene\u0027s given him any signals. He slows the truck down. \"Signals like you wouldn\u0027t believe,\" he says.",
            "The second time we bring the Gold Crown, the heavy curtain next to the door swings up like a Spanish fan. A woman stares at me, and Wayne\u0027s too busy knocking to see. \"Muneca,\" I say. She\u0027s black and unsmiling, and then the curtain drops between us, a whisper on the glass.",
            "She had on a t-shirt that said, \"No problem,\" and didn\u0027t look like she owned the place. She looked more like the help and couldn\u0027t have been older than 20. And from the thinness of her face, I pictured the rest of her skinny. We stared at each other for a second at the most, not enough for me to notice the shape of her ears or if her lips were chapped. I\u0027ve fallen in love on less. Later, in the truck on the way back to the showroom, Wayne mutters, \"This guy is dead. I mean it.\"",
            "The girlfriend calls sometimes, but not often. She has found herself a new boyfriend, some zangano who works at a record store. Dan is his name. And the way she says it, so painfully gringo, makes the corner of my eyes narrow. The last time I saw her in person was in Hoboken. She was with Dan, and hadn\u0027t yet told me about him, and hurried across the street in her high clogs to avoid me and my boys.",
            "The first time we tried to deliver the Gold Crown, the lights are on in the house, but no one lets us in. I bang on the front door, and Wayne hits the back, and I can hear our double drums shaking the windows. Right then, I have this feeling that someone is inside laughing at us. \"This guy better have a good excuse,\" Wayne says. \"This is bull [BLEEP].\" \"You\u0027re telling me,\" I say.",
            "A month before the zangano, I went to her house, a friend visiting a friend. And her parents asked me how business was, as if I balanced the books or something. \"Business is outstanding,\" I said. \"That\u0027s really wonderful to hear,\" the father said. \"You betcha.\"",
            "He asked me to help him mow his lawn. And while we were dribbling gas into the tank, he offered me a job, a real one that you can build on. \"Utilities,\" he said, \"is nothing to be ashamed of.\"",
            "The boss nearly kicked our asses over the Gold Crown. The customer, an ass [BLEEP] named Pruitt called up crazy, said we were delinquent. That\u0027s how the boss put it, \"delinquent.\" We knew that\u0027s what the customer called us because the boss doesn\u0027t use words like that. \"Look boss,\" I said, \"we knocked like crazy. I mean, we knocked like federal marshals, like Paul Bunyan.\" The boss wasn\u0027t having it. He tore us for a good two minutes and then dismissed us.",
            "For most of the night, I didn\u0027t think I had a job, so I hit the bars, fantasizing that I would bump into this cabron out with that black woman, while me and my boys were cranked. But the next morning, Wayne came by with the Gold Crown again. Both of us had hangovers. \"One more time,\" he said. \"An extra delivery. No overtime.\"",
            "We hammered on the door for 10 minutes, but no one answered. I jimmied with the window and the back door. And I could\u0027ve sworn I heard her behind the patio door. I knocked hard and heard footsteps.",
            "We called the boss and told him what was what. And the boss called the house, but no one answered. \"OK,\" the boss said, \"Get those card tables done.\" That night, as we lined up the next day\u0027s paperwork, we got a call from Pruitt, and he didn\u0027t use the word \"delinquent.\" Pruitt said he was contrite and determined and asked us to come again. His maid was sure to let us in.",
            "We park in front of Pruitt\u0027s house and bang on the door. I give Wayne a hard look when I see no car in the garage. \"Yes?\" I hear a voice inside say. \"We\u0027re the delivery guys,\" I yell. A bolt slides, a lock turns, the door opens. She stands in our way, wearing black shorts and a gloss of red on her lips, and I\u0027m sweating.",
            "\"Come in, yes?\" she stands back from the door, holding it open. \"Sounds like Spanish,\" Wayne says. \"No [BLEEP],\" I say, switching over. \"Do you remember me?\" \"No,\" she says.",
            "I look over at Wayne. \"Can you believe this?\" \"I can believe anything, kid.\" \"You heard us, didn\u0027t you? The other day, that was you.\" She shrugs and opens the door wider.",
            "\"You better tell her to prop that with a chair.\" Wayne heads back to unlock the truck. \"You hold that door,\" I say.",
            "But Wayne\u0027s the one who takes his job too seriously. He pounds some more on the door, his face jiggling. A couple of times, he raps on the windows, tries squinting through the curtains. I take a more philosophical approach. I walk over to the ditch that\u0027s been cut next to the road, a drainage pipe half-filled with water, and sit down.",
            "She stays in the kitchen while we work. I can hear her humming. Wayne\u0027s shaking his right hand like he\u0027s scalded his fingertips. \"Yeah, she\u0027s fine.\"",
            "She has her back to me, her hands stirring around in a full sink when I walk in. I try to sound conciliatory. \"You\u0027re from the city?\" A nod. \"Where about?\" \"Washington Heights.\"",
            "\"Dominicana,\" I say, \"Quisqueyana.\" She nods. \"What street?\" \"I don\u0027t know the address,\" she says. \"I have it written down. My mother and my brothers live there.\"",
            "\"I\u0027m Dominican,\" I say. \"You don\u0027t look it.\" I get a glass of water. We\u0027re both staring out at the muddy lawn.",
            "She says, \"I didn\u0027t answer the door because I wanted to make him mad.\" \"Make who mad?\" \"I want to get out of here,\" she says. \"Out of here?\" \"I\u0027ll pay you for a ride.\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I say.",
            "\"Aren\u0027t you from Neuva York?\" \"No.\" \"Then why did you ask the address?\" \"Why? I have family near there.\" \"Would it be that big of a problem?\"",
            "I say in English that she should have her boss bring her. But she stares at me blankly. I switch over. \"He\u0027s a pendejo,\" she says, suddenly angry. I put down the glass, move next to her to wash it.",
            "She\u0027s exactly my height, and smells of liquid detergent, and has tiny, beautiful moles on her neck. \"Here,\" she says, putting out her hand. But I finish it and go back to the den. \"Do you know what she wants us to do?\" I say to Wayne.",
            "Wayne is sinking the bolts into the slate with the Makita. \"You can\u0027t do it,\" he says. \"Why not?\" \"Kid, we have to finish this.\"",
            "\"I\u0027ll be back before you know it. A quick trip, in, out.\" \"Kid,\" he stands up slowly. He\u0027s nearly twice as old as me.",
            "I smoke and watch a mama duck and her three ducklings scavenge the grassy bank and then float downstream like they\u0027re on the same string. \"Beautiful,\" I say, but Wayne doesn\u0027t hear. He\u0027s banging on the door with a staple gun.",
            "I go to the window and look out. New ginkgos stand in rows beside the driveway. A thousand years ago, when I was still in college, I learned something about them. Living fossils, unchanged since their inception millions of years ago.",
            "\"You tagged Charlene, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Sure did,\" he answers. I take the truck keys out of the toolbox. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" I promise.",
            "We reach the Washington bridge without saying a word. \"Is this the best way?\" she asks. The bridge doesn\u0027t seem to impress her. \"It\u0027s the shortest way.\" \"That\u0027s what he said when I arrived last year. I wanted to see the countryside. There was too much rain to see anything anyway.\"",
            "I want to ask her if she loves her boss, but I ask her instead, \"How do you like the States?\" She swings her head across the billboards. \"I\u0027m not surprised by any of it,\" she says.",
            "As we cross over the bridge, I drop my hand into her lap. I leave it there, palm up, fingers slightly curled. Sometimes you just have to try even if you know it won\u0027t work. She turns her head slowly, facing out beyond the bridge cables, out to Manhattan and the Hudson.",
            "Everything in Washington Heights is Dominican. You can\u0027t go a block without passing a Quisqueya bakery, or a Quisqueya supermercado, or a Hotel Quisqueya. If I were to park the truck and get out, nobody would take me for a delivery man. I could be the guy who was on the corner selling Dominican flags. I could be on my way home to my girl.",
            "When we reach her block, I ask a kid with a sag for the building, and he points out the stoop with his pinkie. She gets out of the truck and straightens the front of her sweatshirt before following the line that the kid\u0027s finger has cut across the street. \"Cuidate,\" I say.",
            "Wayne works on the boss, and a week later, I\u0027m back, on probation, painting the warehouse. Wayne brings me meatball sandwiches from out on the road, skinny things with a seam of cheese gumming the bread. \"Was it worth it?\" he asks me. He\u0027s watching me close. I tell him it wasn\u0027t.",
            "\"Did you at least get some?\" \"Hell, yeah,\" I say. \"Are you sure?\"",
            "\"Why would I lie about something like that? Homegirl was an animal. I still have the teeth marks.\" \"Damn,\" he says.",
            "At 9:00, Wayne picks me up at the showroom. And by then, I have our route planned out. The order form tells me everything I need to know about the customers we\u0027ll be dealing with that day.",
            "We\u0027re back on the road a week later, Buckinghams, Imperials, Gold Crowns, and dozens of card tables. I keep a copy of Pruitt\u0027s paperwork. And when the curiosity finally gets to me, I call. The first time, I get the machine. The next two times I\u0027m in the Bedminster area, Pruitt picks up and says, \"Yes?\"",
            "But on the fourth time, she answers. And the sink is running on her side of the phone. And she shuts it off when I don\u0027t say anything. \"Was she there?\" Wayne asks in the trunk. \"Of course she was.\"",
            "He hands me the map, and my fingers trace our deliveries, stitching city to city. \"Looks like we\u0027ve gotten everything,\" I say. \"Finally,\" he yawns. \"What\u0027s first tomorrow?\" We won\u0027t really know until morning when I\u0027ve gotten the paperwork in order, but I take guesses anyway.",
            "One of our games. It passes the time, gives us something to look forward to. I close my eyes and put my hand down on the map. So many towns, so many cities to choose from.",
            "Some places are sure bets, but more than once I\u0027ve gone for the long shot and been right. You can\u0027t imagine how many times I\u0027ve been right. But this time, nothing comes. No magic, no nothing. It could be anywhere.",
            "I open my eyes and see that Wayne is still waiting. \"Edison,\" I say, pressing my thumb down. \"Edison, New Jersey.\"",
            "If someone is just getting a 52-inch card table delivered, then you know they aren\u0027t going to give you too much of a hassle, but they also aren\u0027t going to tip. Those are your Spotswood, Sayreville, and Perth Amboy deliveries. The pool tables go north to the rich suburbs, Livingston, Ridgewood, Bedminster. You should see our customers, doctors, diplomats, surgeons, presidents of universities, ladies in slacks and silk tops who sport thin watches you could trade in for a car.",
            "Most of them prepare for us by laying down a path of yesterday\u0027s Washington Post from the front door to the game room. I make them pick it all up. I say, \"Carajo, what if we slip? Do you know what 200 pounds of slate could do to a floor?\" The threat of property damage puts the chop-chop in their step.",
            "Sometimes the customer has to jet to the store for cat food or a newspaper while we\u0027re in the middle of a job. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be all right,\" they say. They never sound too sure. \"Of course,\" I say, \"just show us where the silver\u0027s at.\" The customers ha-ha, and we ha-ha. And then they agonize over leaving, linger by the front door, trying to memorize everything they own, as if they don\u0027t know where to find us, who we work for.",
            "Once they\u0027re gone, I don\u0027t have to worry about anyone bothering me. I put down the ratchet, crack my knuckles, and explore, usually while Wayne is smoothing out the felt and doesn\u0027t need help. I take cookies from the kitchen, razors from the bathroom cabinets. Some of these houses have 20, 30 rooms."

            "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a wide variety of writers, reporters, and performers to take a whack at that theme with radio monologues, documentaries, short fiction, and, occasionally, short radio dramas. Our program today is called Deliveries, about deliveries. And we\u0027ve arrived at Act Three, World Premiere.",
            "\"The Heart of Times Square,\" by David Sedaris, performed by Toby Wherry and Penelope Boyer.",
            "David Sedaris is a frequent contributor to our program, author of the new book of stories called Naked, an occasional commentator on NPR\u0027s Morning Edition. And a few weeks ago, we gave him this assignment, to write a radio play using only the sound effects from one sound effects record. And he had to use every sound on the record somewhere in the drama. He accepted the challenge.",
            "We chose as our sound effects record this volume I hold in my hand. It is called Ultimate Sound Effects over one hour-- I guess that isn\u0027t part of the title-- volume 5, CD 8093-2. \"Compose\" is the label. The effects on here, just so you can follow, the challenge that faced the playwright, in order, on the CD anyway, are \"Horse-drawn Carriage On Street,\" \"Swamp Noises,\" \"Time Bomb Through Airport Security.\" You see that on a CD record, and you wonder, \"How much call is there for something like this in our radio production world?\" \"Steam Trains At Station,\" \"Exterior Airport,\" \"Construction Site,\" \"Bowling Alley,\" \"Jet Takes Off,\" \"Native Americans Dance,\" \"Busy Harbor,\" \"Animals At Riverside,\" \"Big Cats,\" \"Old Clock Chimes,\" \"Car Accident,\" \"Five-Minute War,\" \"Barnyard Sounds,\" \"Workshop,\" \"Aviary,\" and \"The Sound Of A Beating Human Heart.\"",
            "We asked David, also, to keep the play short, possibly the hardest part of the assignment. I read him the list of effects over the phone. And he took as part of the assignment-- he decided to do them in exactly the order that they appear on the CD. Here is the world premiere of the radio play that he created."

            "He said to leave. I said, call the police. The attending rent-a-cop looked sheepishly at the ground. The stalemate broke when Larry promised to call me the next day. He never did.",
            "I did get a call from FedEx security. They said, they considered the package stolen. Maxwell was right. Several days later, FedEx personnel called to assure me that I\u0027d be happy to know they were fixing the problem by terminating Maxwell. \"Why,\" I said \"were they going to fire the only employee I dealt with who represented the company well?\" \"He shouldn\u0027t have said FedEx packages are often stolen,\" the FedEx rep answered.",
            "\"But he was right. Doesn\u0027t honesty count for anything?\" \"Unfortunately, no,\" she snapped, just before hanging up.",
            "Meanwhile, the letter I faxed to Gateway\u0027s CEO wound its way to upper management. One afternoon, a Gateway vice president called to grovel and offered to donate computers to the Anti-Defamation League. The problem is I hate the Anti-Defamation League. The only thing I trust more than capitalism is free speech. To the ADL, Gateway\u0027s offhand remark might as well have been a pogrom.",
            "Their reaction to the offer confirmed my suspicions. They didn\u0027t want to \"be bought off\" with a few computers. They wanted apologies and sensitivity training. I explained to the ADL spokeswoman that I was happy with the letter of apology Gateway\u0027s CEO had sent me, and I didn\u0027t believe in sensitivity training.",
            "Back in Memphis, FedEx\u0027s security chief went on vacation, the reimbursing agent filled out the form wrong, and Edward Maxwell was looking for another job. I informed FedEx that I was writing a story about my ordeal. Within a few hours, I received a flurry of calls. The claims agent called, three supervisors, a media relations expert, a vice president, and, finally, the CEO.",
            "\"FedEx was ashamed,\" they told me. They would refund my money right away. \"Can I overnight you a check?\" said one. \"You\u0027ll get it Friday.\" I asked them to send it UPS.",
            "I know it\u0027s not fashionable, but I believe in big business.",
            "No, they didn\u0027t. They sent it FedEx. They said it was their policy.",
            "It would\u0027ve been. I thought of just putting \"Return to Sender\" at the top. Until this incident, I was a FedEx lover. There was nothing I loved more than FedEx.",
            "I got the software. I would call the 1-800-number, type in my tracking number on the phone, and listen, \"Your package is now in Washington. Your package is en route to Chicago. Your package is now delivered.\" I would do this hour after hour. 3:00 in the morning, I would call FedEx.",
            "Your package has experienced turbulence. When Fred Smith, who\u0027s the CEO of Federal Express, and I talked, he said that Washington actually was the worst office.",
            "Yeah, it did. They had a secretary call, but the person who answers the phones at The New Republic kept saying, I was in a meeting with an editor and kept voicemailing him, which I\u0027m sure he didn\u0027t like.",
            "So he called on his own later. And we talked. And the first thing he said is, \"Well, you probably don\u0027t want to hear about all the technology that we\u0027re developing in order to track packages.\" And of course, being a total FedEx fiend, I said, \"Yes, I do.\" And we were on the phone for quite some time, talking about all the different types of new computers they\u0027re putting in. But none of these computers were able to find my package.",
            "Right, of course. My point was that these computers are great, but they don\u0027t stop the problem, which is if someone just walks off with a package on the truck.",
            "He said I had a good point. And that\u0027s when I got my refund.",
            "It\u0027s because I trust the business world so much that my harrowing, recent run-ins with several of its most respected citizens came as such a shock. Last summer, I excitedly ordered a laptop from Gateway 2000, the mail order giant.",
            "After repeated delays, I called their 800-number to complain. 10 calls later, a customer service representative told me I could only get an answer to my question if I called at a specific hour. When I protested that I couldn\u0027t call at the time since it was Rosh Hashanah, the woman muttered, \"Then the kike will have to wait.\" Enraged, I faxed a letter to Gateway\u0027s CEO, but got no response.",
            "Finally, the computer arrived. It was delivered to my parents\u0027 house in Chicago, so my father shipped it to me in Washington via Federal Express, the trusty, always-on-time mail company I had cited as proof that we need to privatize the postal service. The package was late. I called. They said, it was on its way. Routine, right?",
            "A dozen phone calls later, I began to worry. I nervously dialed the dispatcher. \"You\u0027re making me look bad,\" she snapped. \"If you call the 800-number again, I won\u0027t look for your box.\" Deprived of phone privileges, I drove to FedEx\u0027s Washington warehouse.",
            "There, I met a counter worker named Edward Maxwell. He launched a Watergate-level investigation, interviewed three drivers, combed through the depths of the warehouse, and personally examined dozens of trucks. But my package never turned up.",
            "Later, Maxwell asked me what was in the box. I told him it contained a laptop computer. And in a V-8 moment, he hit his head with his open palm. \"Oh, computer. They walk out of here all the time,\" he said. \"Never, never send one through FedEx.\" Another employee told me I should always use UPS."
