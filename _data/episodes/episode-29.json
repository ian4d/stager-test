And today, we bring you perspectives on Bob Dole. Because at this point, there\u0027s something oddly mesmerizing about what\u0027s going on in that campaign. Barely a day goes by without some odd quote or strange gaffe."

In response to Buchanan\u0027s complaints, the Dole people tell reporters that Buchanan is doing the calling to a few of his supporters to tar Dole. It takes a special sort of credulity to believe them. I stopped half a dozen people carrying Buchanan signs who told the same stories of strange phone calls in the night."

The political analysis gets encased in these scenes, in these little stories. And it\u0027s just a complete pleasure to read.

Every night after a day with Dole, I return home and recall to my mind a pair of mental images that the day has badly blemished. The first is the one of Dole recuperating from his war wounds, as described by Richard Ben Cramer, hanging by his bad right arm and trying to straighten it out until he was sweating and crying from pain. The second is a windy afternoon last June in a graveyard on the French coast, when, Dole now says, he realized he had to run for president one last time."

He knows that the throngs cheering for him today will be cheering for someone else tomorrow, that enthusiasm is fickle, that real support for someone like him always has something completely contingent about it.

        "I asked five different Dole aides the identity of the baby held by Dole in the photograph he gave to Forbes. It seems an innocent enough query. After all, this was the picture Dole had selected for publication. I get no answer.",
        "The basic pose of the Dole campaign is the less anyone finds out about their candidate, the better. You can spot the Dole office in the row of glass boxes on the ground floor of the New Hampshire Holiday Inn. It\u0027s the one with the newspaper taped up on the glass to prevent people from outside looking in. Dole himself remains largely out of sight. He makes two or three very brief appearances each day and is otherwise unavailable for interviews.",
        "Dole\u0027s speeches add nothing to the general blank picture. A dozen times I listened to his talk, pen poised idly over paper. Nothing, not a thought, not an image, not a quote.",
        "It took me a while to figure out why this was, but then it struck me. Bob Dole wasn\u0027t running for president. The concept of Bob Dole was running. The man himself had subcontracted out all the dirty work to people who make their careers out of this sort of thing. That was why he was referring to himself in the third person. He wasn\u0027t there, at least not in any meaningful way.",
        "It turns out that everything I will discover about Bob Dole, I will discover by stealth. My first discovery? He\u0027s embarrassed by his own vanity. I catch him in a back room at one event, just before he\u0027s about to go onstage. He thinks no one is looking. He checks out his reflection furtively. His hair is sprayed and dyed. And then he whips out of his pocket a tiny canister and squirts two quick blasts of breath spray into his mouth.",
        "Also, his wit is genuine. It\u0027s not just an act. I stalk him through the snow at the world dog sledding championships and watch him meet and greet the pooches. A schoolgirl approaches as he\u0027s about to leave and after nabbing a photo, asks him if he\u0027s having fun. \"You learn a lot out here campaigning,\" Dole says, motioning to a sled of 20 dogs. \"They\u0027re all nice dogs, too, not like the Congress.\" He thinks no one is listening. He\u0027s said it just for the fun of it.",
        "All other data about Bob Dole must be inferred from the world he has created around himself. The Dole campaign consists of slick young men in blue suits, forever whispering to each other in dark corners. The campaign pays top dollar for everything. And I get the feeling that most who work for it have some personal financial stake in Dole soldiering on, and that they\u0027ll be the last to tell him that he really shouldn\u0027t be doing this again.",
        "You also get the feeling that there is very little the campaign would not do. One of their favorite techniques has been to hire telemarketing firms to call Buchanan supporters and, in the guise of pollsters, relate damning untruths. In response to Buchanan\u0027s complaints, the Dole people tell reporters that Buchanan is doing the calling to a few of his supporters to tar Dole. It takes a special sort of credulity to believe them. I stopped half a dozen people carrying Buchanan signs who told the same stories of strange phone calls in the night.",
        "One afternoon, I abandoned the Dole campaign for the steam room at the Manchester YMCA to purge myself of the dreadful feeling coming over me. A few minutes later, an extremely fat old man waddles in, spies me, drops his towel, and sits on a plastic stool right next to me. \"You\u0027re a new face,\" he says. \"I always notice a new face.\" I say, \"That\u0027s nice,\" grab for a towel, and tell him I came for the campaign.",
        "He shifts on his stool and says, \"I\u0027m a Buchanan man, myself.\" Buchanan men are the kind of guys who can sidle up to other guys in steam rooms without the slightest fear of being thought gay. Moments later, he\u0027s complaining about the calls he\u0027s getting at home. Here, roughly, is what he said.",
        "\"A guy calls. He says, \u0027Hi. My name is William, and I\u0027m calling from the Dole campaign. Are you aware that Pat Buchanan is an extremist?\u0027 And I say, \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 And he says, \u0027Pat wants to give nuclear weapons to South Korea and Japan.\u0027",
        "So I ask him, \u0027Where does this information come from.\u0027 He says he doesn\u0027t know. So I ask him, \u0027What does Bob Dole think about that?\u0027 And this kid doesn\u0027t know that, either. He knows absolutely nothing about Bob Dole.",
        "So I ask, \u0027Who are you, anyway?\u0027 And he says he\u0027s with an organization called the National Research Institute in Houston. So I ask him for his phone number. And he says he can\u0027t give it to me. Then he hangs up. There is, of course, no listing in Houston for the National Research Institute.\"",
        "In short, the Dole campaign is a lot like what a lot of people probably suspect the Buchanan campaign is, closed, secretive, smug, a bit nasty. Maybe that\u0027s what happens when you lose once too often. You stop trusting the voters.",
        "And yet I still want badly to like Dole. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s the guy in the race that people most badly want to like, but can\u0027t quite figure out how to do it. Every night after a day with Dole, I return home and recall to my mind a pair of mental images that the day has badly blemished. The first is the one of Dole recuperating from his war wounds, as described by Richard Ben Cramer, hanging by his bad right arm and trying to straighten it out until he was sweating and crying from pain. The second is a windy afternoon last June in a graveyard on the French coast, when, Dole now says, he realized he had to run for president one last time.",
        "I traveled there on Clinton\u0027s plane to witness the D-Day celebrations. But about halfway through, I lost interest in writing about it and just started watching. You gaze down the cliff onto the beach and just marvel. How did these men do this?",
        "Just before Clinton addressed the veterans of the Normandy invasion, I found myself walking alone through the rows of white crosses, until I reached a place where there was no one else but a pair of veterans. They seemed ancient, though of course, they could not have been much older than Bob Dole. They were trembling and leaning on each other as they looked down on a cross. And at first, I thought it was just from the strains of age.",
        "Then I saw the name and place on the cross, Stenson, I\u0027ll say, from Mississippi. The boy had died at the age of 19 on the first day of the invasion. The old men wore name tags, too. Stenson, from Mississippi.",
        "Two of three brothers had survived that day. They were crying without tears. That\u0027s a bit like Dole, I would like to believe. He\u0027s crying without tears. He has the emotions, or at least, you can sense them lurking inside them. But he has no idea how to give them proper expression.",
        "February 19. The act, I should say, is always the same. The announcer brings on stage, one at a time, all the politicians who have endorsed Dole. They race out onto the stage like ballplayers before a game. Dole waits in the background until the crowd reaches a low fever pitch. A quick squirt of the breath spray, and he\u0027s on.",
        "He stands at the podium with his left foot and left side jutted forward, though he\u0027s right-handed. His crippled right hand rests on the podium, but it\u0027s not a prop. He\u0027ll start in with something self-deprecating. \"That\u0027s a lot better than the speech is going to be.\" Something like that.",
        "Presently, the voice of Dole emanates from the Milford, New Hampshire, town hall\u0027s facade. It\u0027s not so much a speech as a series of disconnected phrases uttered in an elegiac tone, some of which cause the people around me to break out into giggles. \"Like everyone else in this room, I was born,\" Dole says. A Dole speech sounds like the sort of thing a red brick building would say if a red brick building could speak.",
        "He pulls the rhythms of his \"one America\" refrain up short, just as it starts to flow. \"We\u0027re not rich. We\u0027re not poor. We\u0027re not urban. We\u0027re not rural. We\u0027re not black. We\u0027re not white. You can go on and on and on.\" I have a dream, kind of. And gentleman in England now abed, well, I don\u0027t know. Maybe they should just get up.",
        "It is more like the Cliff Notes of a great speech than the speech itself. The only lines Dole can deliver with any kind of strength sound like they were cribbed from Robert\u0027s Rules of Order. \"Start the hearings. Go through the process. Do it in an orderly way.\"",
        "The whole time Dole is speaking, it is as if he is saying, \"This is the speech I would give to you if I was the sort of person who gives speeches.\" I\u0027m not sure whether Dole is actually modest or simply embarrassed by immodesty. I leave thinking that a man like this runs for the presidency not because he thinks he should be president. He thinks no one else should be president, so it might as well be him.",
        "May 27. You never saw a more unhappy-looking group than the journalists assigned to follow Dole into New Jersey on Memorial Day. \"I got the best seat in the house to the worst show in town,\" rumbles a cameraman as we board the plane at National Airport. \"I just came in case he got shot or something,\" says a reporter, who doesn\u0027t even bother to take notes.",
        "I, too, have my misgivings. Usually, my campaign notebooks are crammed with anecdotes, observations, and incidents. Whenever I\u0027m with Dole, however, they simply refuse to fill up. The Dole campaign remains an arid, sterile place. Not much grows there.",
        "Today is a kind of prelude to the general campaign, which will be relaunched in earnest tomorrow with a bold journey across the country. Dole marches for a dozen blocks through Clifton, New Jersey, in front of the parade\u0027s single float, bookended by his wife, Elizabeth, and Governor Christie Todd Whitman. The crowd is quiet and sparse, less than one deep.",
        "The parade climaxes in a park, where Dole is meant to make a few remarks and lay a wreath on a symbolic grave site. I wait there for him, watching members of the local veterans organization subtly jockey for position. Six old men form the color guard, dressed in red jackets, VFW caps covered with patches and buttons, and the apprehensive air of people who fear they might be asked to improvise.",
        "But the really striking thing about them is how old they look, at least compared to Dole. They could almost be a different generation. \"Any veterans of the first World War here?\" I ask. \"We just buried our last one last fall,\" says one, who sports a POW-MIA pin in his cap. \"Don\u0027t come around here 10 years from now,\" says the man beside him, \"or we won\u0027t be here, either.\"",
        "May 28. It turns out that we are flying all the way across the country to spend less than 24 hours in California before picking up and flying back. First to Chicago, where we\u0027ll spend tomorrow night, and then to Ohio, on May the 28th, five months before the election. The only reason it doesn\u0027t seem insane is that several hundred seemingly sober men in dark suits follow Dole wherever he goes. There is a kind of ambitious young person who mistakes frenetic movement for advancement in the world. They\u0027ll call you from the road and say, \"I\u0027m in Bangladesh on business, heading for Iceland.\" And you know that he thinks this is sufficient explanation of his purpose in life.",
        "The Dole campaign has something of this feeling. As long as the candidate keeps moving, everyone traveling with him is exempt from serious self-examination. Which is a shame, since they have no idea why they are doing what they are doing. It\u0027s frequent flyer politics.",
        "And within a couple of hours, I\u0027m having my first Admiral Stockdale moment. Who am I? What am I doing here?",
        "Early the second morning, we descend, in our motorcade of 13 cars and 2 buses, on a seemingly tranquil park in Redondo Beach. The point of the event and the trip is to illustrate that Dole is against crime. The trouble is that Clinton is against crime, too. So Dole needs to show that he\u0027s more fervently against crime than Clinton, who at this very moment is on route to New Orleans to deliver his own anti-crime speech. Dole and Clinton are like Time and Newsweek. No matter how much they claim to differ, they still run the same covers, week after week.",
        "The park is being celebrated as an example of a neighborhood reclaiming public space from urban violence. But as various political dignitaries loudly disapprove of drive-by shootings, a small group of dissenters forms on the fringe. All but one are the Hispanics who bear the brunt of the new anti-crime esprit. They\u0027re hauled off to jail for all sorts of odd crimes, carrying baseball bats into the park after 7 o\u0027clock in the evening, for instance.",
        "The exception is a gentle old soul named Art Campbell, who for decades has cleaned the park, coached the local kids, and groomed the playing fields. The ball field at the center of the park is named for him. Art Campbell is a Dole supporter. \"I\u0027m for the man,\" he says. \"I don\u0027t go by the party.\" But he\u0027s mildly perplexed by the anti-crime rally. \"It isn\u0027t as bad as all that,\" he says.",
        "A policeman on the scene confirms that the crime statistics in Redondo Beach are in line with those of the nation as a whole. Violent crime has declined steadily here, as it has in other cities, over the past 20 years. More to the point, he cannot recall a single violent crime in the park. \"A few years ago, someone shot a gun in the air as he drove past the park,\" he says, \"But no one was hurt.\"",
        "Campbell stops the park custodian, a Hispanic man who speaks poor English. \"Do you think this Dole thing is a good idea?\" he asks the man. The man takes one look at my notepad and says, \"I no want to say.\" He\u0027s afraid of offending his employers. The greatest fear in the park is the fear of offending the people on the platform who are spearheading the anti-crime initiative.",
        "Having successfully fed, and fed off of, the fear of crime, we wearily board the bus. I am now certain that nothing interesting will ever occur in the close-cropped frame of the staged Dole event. Where do politics come from, anyway? Not from listening to Bob Dole deliver a speech written by someone else to a group of people he knows nothing about in a place to which he\u0027ll never return.",
        "Many of the criticisms about Dole can be made of Clinton, too, of course. You can\u0027t say anything about Dole\u0027s use of push polls, or about the cynicism of his staged events, without having some seasoned reporter look at you as if you were a child and say, \"So what? They all do that.\"",
        "The next week, the New York Times will carry a putatively positive piece about Dole\u0027s campaign manager, Scott Reed. Toward the end of it, almost by-the-by, we read this astonishing revelation about Dole\u0027s senate resignation. Quote, \"The element of surprise was essential, Mr. Dole and Reed decided, if the announcement were to appear bold and make an impression on voters. \u0027If it had leaked,\u0027 Mr. Reed said, \u0027he probably wouldn\u0027t have done it.\u0027\"",
        "Think of it. Just a few weeks ago, the man stood before us and brought tears to our eyes by saying that you do not lay claim to the office you hold. It lays claim to you. Your obligation is to bring to it the gifts you can, of labor and honesty, and then to part with grace.",
        "But according to Reed, Dole\u0027s decision to end his wonderful senate career was baldly conceived as a PR stunt. Journalists are often accused of being cynical. But the cynicism of journalists does not compare to that of serious presidential candidates."

Maybe he won\u0027t be interviewing the Gores or the Clintons because Elizabeth Dole gave him the plug in the book and that emphatic, sternly scolding \"Larry\" at the end. And then Larry King points his gatling gun mouth at Elizabeth, who, with a big old smile on her face, is like, \"I thought we were there to talk about the book, Larry.\" Like, how harsh is Elizabeth Dole? I seriously would never want to be on Elizabeth Dole\u0027s bad side.",
        "Next, they\u0027re going on and on about how badly the campaign is doing. And Elizabeth Dole is talking about how no one is engaged because it\u0027s summer vacation. And Larry King is all, \"Well, you know the media. Today\u0027s mistake is tomorrow\u0027s headline.\" And how weird to hear Mr. Media Manipulation himself talk about the goings-on of the media as if they are a totally natural state of affairs that he himself has nothing to do with. How annoying is that?",
        "And then Bob Dole, instead of casually dropping his buzzwords one by one into the conversation, just reels off a whole bunch of them wholesale. And meanwhile, Larry King is still stuck on the whole tax thing and is trying to pin Bob dole down. And I have to wonder whether Larry King has really bad breath or something, because Bob Dole kept making these faces as if that might be the case.",
        "So then Elizabeth Dole is talking about Bob Dole\u0027s message and Bob Dole\u0027s agenda, and then it\u0027s her turn to start reeling off a list of agenda bullet points. And then Bob Dole basically says that without television, a politician can\u0027t campaign, which is a pretty scary thing, if you ask me. And then he adds in all the bullet points of what Bill Clinton has done wrong so far. And then Bob Dole is saying how he\u0027s glad to be the underdog and that the real campaign is going to kick off with a powerful acceptance speech by Bob Dole at the Republican National Convention.",
        "And then Bob Dole announces that Susan Molinari is going to be the keynote speaker, since she is young and dynamic. And Elizabeth Dole adds that Molinari believes strongly in what Bob Dole stands for. And it\u0027s almost at the point where if you couldn\u0027t see the TV picture, you might very well wonder if Bob Dole is still in the room or not, since everyone, including Bob Dole, keeps saying \"Bob Dole.\"",
        "Meanwhile, Larry King is milking the whole Susan Molinari thing. And he\u0027s like, \"That\u0027s a big statement about cities.\" And Bob Dole adds women to that list. And then he starts going on and on about all this stuff he\u0027s done for women all these years.",
        "And all I know is that I was taking the M7 uptown bus the other day, and we were going through Midtown. And there were these two women seated in front of me. And in Midtown, there\u0027s this big clock which shows a readout of the national debt getting higher and higher. And this one woman is like, \"Look, the national debt just gets higher and higher.\" Like maybe they should take the money that everyone saves with MCI, which is another huge number readout in Midtown, and put that money toward paying off the national debt.",
        "So then she asks her friend, \"Who are you voting for?\" And the second lady is like, \"I don\u0027t like the situation we\u0027re in one bit. I don\u0027t see anyone with any high morals or good ideas, and I don\u0027t like Bob Dole. I don\u0027t like his stance on issues. Plus, I think he\u0027s too old.\"",
        "And the first lady\u0027s like \"Too old.\" And the second lady is like, \"Too old. He would be a one-term president.\" And the other lady is like, \"Definitely a one-term president.\" So maybe Bob Dole should ride around on New York mass transit to get a sense of what he should be doing. And then Bob Dole goes on about what he\u0027s done for women, saying, \"I\u0027ve been living with a woman,\" which was a really, really weird thing to say.",
        "So then we get an advertisement about health insurance sponsored by the Republican National Committee, showing this smirking kid breathing through a tube while his mother goes on about what we need. And then there\u0027s a commercial for life insurance featuring these crying statues in the rain. And I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s such a good idea to remind people about sickness and death when Bob Dole is on the program.",
        "And Larry King brings up Susan Molinari again, like, \"Yeah, Larry, we get your little prearranged scoop. Quit working it so much.\" And Larry King is like, \"How did you get involved in this tobacco thing?\" And Bob Dole is like, \"Just blew in, I guess.\" And then you realize that Bob Dole keeps looking at himself in the monitor, or else someone is there backstage that he\u0027s looking at for cues.",
        "And how sick is it to refer to the undeniable pull of tobacco company money in Bob Dole\u0027s pocket as something that \"just blew in\"? And then Bob Dole says he\u0027s not a scientist and so couldn\u0027t know that smoking is addictive, which is weird, because later he refers to relatives who were sick due to smoking-related problems. How much evidence do you personally need, Bob Dole?",
        "And then Larry King is like, \"Would you tell Americans to stop smoking?\" And Bob Dole is like, \"Yeah, all of you stop smoking.\" And Elizabeth Dole qualifies that with \"pregnant women and elderly people with respiratory disorders.\" Where do you think most respiratory disorders come from, Elizabeth Dole?",
        "And then Bob Dole is like, \"It\u0027s not good for you. It\u0027s bad for your health. Don\u0027t do it.\" And having said that, like he was about to go on, but Elizabeth Dole interrupts him and goes, \"That\u0027s it.\" And they all laugh. And we get an arthritis pain medication commercial and a denture cream commercial.",
        "So then Larry King is asking Elizabeth Dole about what she\u0027s going to be doing as First Lady. And she starts going on about being a supportive spouse. And Bob Dole makes a joke about calling her up for a transfusion. And then he looks at the monitor again. And meanwhile, Elizabeth Dole is going on about going around the country to places where mentally challenged youths are making beautiful products. And I swear to god, if she got any more condescending, I was going to seriously put my foot through the television.",
        "So then Bob Dole goes on the record as not speaking about Clinton\u0027s character by listing Whitewater and Filegate as two things he hasn\u0027t talked about, even though he just did. And then Larry King brings up more records. And then Bob Dole goes, \"Trust.\"",
        "And then Elizabeth Dole starts going on about how Bob Dole was a poor farmboy whose family moved their kids into the basement to rent out the house to make ends meet. How depressing is that? No wonder Bob Dole has a sour demeanor all the time, since he grew up with no windows.",
        "And then Elizabeth Dole goes on some more, like maybe she should let her husband talk just a little bit. And then Larry King brings up the Jimmy Carter question. \"Can you say you would never tell a lie?\" And Bob Dole goes, \"Yes.\" And Elizabeth Dole goes, \"Yes.\" Whose question is that?",
        "And then they go on and on about affirmative action. And then Larry King promises to take phone calls for, like, the 50th time. Maybe no one is calling in or something. And then we get that health insurance commercial again and an ad for some ginseng-based energizing dietary supplement to help you feel not so old.",
        "Next, they\u0027re talking about the stock market. And we finally go to calls, but Larry doesn\u0027t seem to know how to work the phones. And the caller\u0027s from Georgia. And I was hoping it was that guy who called up when Jesse Helms was on, thanking him for all his work in controlling blacks, only he didn\u0027t say blacks. But it was only some guy asking about running mates again. The one call that they take on the show, and it is some yokel who didn\u0027t get that they weren\u0027t going to talk about possible running mates.",
        "So finally, we get Susan Molinari on the phone from a restaurant somewhere, gushing on and on about Bob Dole to the point where they probably should have cut her off. And Larry King asks whether Susan Molinari thinks her pro-choice abortion stand is going to be a problem. And Susan Molinari is going on about how, \"This is the man to bring the convention together, and there is no greater honor in the world than to speak on behalf of the gentleman currently on your show.\" You would think Susan Molinari just found God or something, the way she was going on about it.",
        "And all I want to know is does Susan Molinari on the phone to Larry King count as a paid Republican advertisement for Bob Dole, especially when Larry King points out that Bob Dole is the guest who\u0027s appeared most on the Larry King show? And then Larry King makes a point of reminding all the news flunkies out there that the two points from his show to remember are \"Never lie\" and \"Susan Molinari.\" And I don\u0027t think November could be any scarier in my mind at this point.",
        "So I\u0027m watching Larry King Live the other night, and Bob Dole is wearing a dark gray suit and a powerish, reddish tie. And Elizabeth Dole is wearing a blue, blue dress and Red Cross red lipstick, which I guess means she\u0027s going for that red, white, and blue effect. And the first question is about the statement made by somebody that Hillary should debate Elizabeth.",
        "And Bob Dole is like, \"It was a joke.\" And Elizabeth Dole is like, \"It was in jest, Larry.\" And then Elizabeth Dole goes on and on about how the emphasis should be on the presidential candidates, which is funny, because she doesn\u0027t let poor Bob Dole get a word in edgewise.",
        "So next, Larry King is asking whether there are any women on \"the list\" for vice president, since Elizabeth Dole said that in our lifetime, there would be women presidential candidates. And Bob Dole goes on and on about his process for picking a VP. And Larry King, sounding like someone out of The Godfather, is like, \"But you know all of these guys. What do you need a process for?\"",
        "And Bob Dole starts to list the things he looks for in a vice president. And two of them are health and age, which I thought kind of weird. Like maybe Bob Dole shouldn\u0027t be allowed to say the words health and age at all. And all I could imagine was a room full of Dole campaign handlers in Larry King\u0027s green room going \"Damn!\" at the top of their lungs."

        "And Dan Aykroyd kind of does the bully Dole from the \u002770s. Dole back then was sort of a Nixon protege. And then I figured I\u0027d take it a little further and make it a little munchkin-like.",
        "\"Because Bob Dole tends to, when he rolls, when he keeps going, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], you\u0027ll be hist-- you\u0027ll be hist-- you\u0027ll be history.\" That kind of thing. Then I figured out that Bob Dole is actually the tree from The Wizard of Oz. He\u0027s not a munchkin. He\u0027s actually--",
        "Mayor of Munchkinland, you know. \"And she\u0027s not really, really dead. She\u0027s really most sincerely dead.\" Kind of sounds like Bob Dole. \"Not really-diddily dead. She\u0027s really-- let me tell you something. Bill Clinton\u0027s campaign is dead.\"",
        "But anyway, what he\u0027s really like is The Wizard of Oz tree, which is, \"I\u0027m Bob Dole. How\u0027d you like it if somebody took apples off of you?\"",
        "[LAUGHTER]",
        "You know, he\u0027s even got the same expression as the tree. And he\u0027s tragic in the way the tree is. People are constantly pulling apples off, and they\u0027re not tasting them. I\u0027ve got about five minutes more on this analogy.",
        "Pshaw. Nonsense, Conan O\u0027Brien. Now you listen to me. Bob Dole wasn\u0027t last night. Bob Dole\u0027s the new president of the United States, that\u0027s right.",
        "Dole\u0027s on a roll. Dole topped the polls. That\u0027s right. Dole\u0027s in control. Dole\u0027s riding a bull-Dole-zer. Shoot that punk. Shoot that punk, smoke that Dole.",
        "On Conan? Yeah.",
        "Oh, well, I\u0027m just imagining his deepest thoughts. And he\u0027s just letting them out at 12:30 at night, when no one\u0027s watching. That\u0027s sort of the premise. Like, \"Bob Dole\u0027s the next president of the United States. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Sing with me, O\u0027Brien.\" And I would make him sing, you know, \"Happy Happy Dole Dole.\"",
        "--Dole de-Dole de-Dole.",
        "Dole de-Dole, Dole de-Dole. Dole-de--",
        "Dole.",
        "When I do a politician on that show, I\u0027m almost always doing the id of that politician. It\u0027s basically nonsense. And sometimes I just have Dole giggling, and just--",
        "Bow down to me, Conan O\u0027Brien. Bow down to the next senate majority leader, most powerful man in the world.",
        "Yeah, I really-- it\u0027s hard not to like Bob Dole anyway. I mostly feel sorry for him. To me, it just seems like it\u0027s only going to get worse for Bob Dole. At the point where he\u0027s supposed to catch up, where everybody expects that it\u0027s going to tighten, that\u0027s when they\u0027re going to debate. And Bob Dole needs to have a 20-point lead before they start debating.",
        "Unconsciously, yeah, sometimes. I just got a puppy, and I find it very effective training.",
        "Very effective, just when I put on the Bob Dole voice at the puppy. \"Sit! You listen to me, puppy. You poop.\"",
        "My tombstone will say \"Da Corpse,\" I think.",
        "That\u0027s right. That\u0027s how I used the Bob Dole thing there. He\u0027s lost track of who Bob Dole is. \"Why won\u0027t Bob Dole debate me? Bob Dole is hiding. Somebody--\" And then he turned around and started yelling at the people behind him, like he thought they were the audience all the sudden.",
        "Well, we\u0027ve made fun of that on the Conan show, too, you know.",
        "Yeah. Well, we\u0027ve segued from him going, \"I tell you, Bill Clinton\u0027s going to jail. Hillary Clinton\u0027s going to jail. Socks the cat\u0027s going to jail. Oh, what am I talking about? What\u0027s happening to Dole?",
        "Like that, O\u0027Brien? That\u0027s a new Dole. New Dole cries. New Dole cries. Boo-hoo. Like it?\" This man has cried more-- I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a politician who\u0027s cried in public more than Bob Dole. It\u0027s such an amazing flip side to the guy, who\u0027s looked down as such a hardass.",
        "Nixon\u0027s funeral. He cried in Russell, Kansas. He cried a little bit when he announced his resignation this year from the senate. And he cried when he went to Russell, Kansas. I mean, that\u0027s twice this spring. And then he cried at Nixon\u0027s funeral.",
        "[LAUGHTER]",
        "Do I buy it? Yeah. Well, I buy the Nixon\u0027s funeral one. There didn\u0027t seem to be any political upside in that one.",
        "So if you buy that one, then you have to think that it\u0027s possible that he was sincere in the other two. I can imagine the senate one would be hard for him. The Russell, Kansas thing, that stretches credibility a little bit. Because basically, he only goes to Russell, Kansas to cry. Supposedly he\u0027s never there except to make a speech once every eight years, when he runs for president.",
        "Got to go to Russell. Oh my god, I\u0027m feeling a little bummed.",
        "You mean just physical moves?",
        "All right. Well, Bob Dole, I sort of walked you through Bob Dole. Start with the test pattern, \"Nnnnn.\"",
        "\"Dole, and everything is monotone after that. And he says the same thing in the same tone of voice, speaks very rapidly, Dole.\" And then putting an \"Nn\" before the Dole makes him seem older. \"Nn-Dole,\" that kind of thing.",
        "Well, it depends on how far you want to take one. If you want to do the crazy Clinton, then that\u0027s easy. You start with Bruce Springsteen.",
        "And it\u0027s just, \"Hey, little Mary with your daddy home. Hey, man. How you doing? How\u0027s it going, everybody? Whee-haw.\"",
        "But then there\u0027s more of a-- the more accurate Clinton is kind of the caring guy who\u0027s just sort of a gentle thing. And it takes very little, very little energy. You just barely, barely breathe, hardly at all.",
        "When I\u0027m doing this, yeah. I feel the air. That\u0027s very good, yes. I feel the air pushing toward the back of my throat.",
        "Instantly, I thought of Dan Aykroyd\u0027s impression, which was ingrained in my head from working at Saturday Night Live. And what I try to do is find something and take it further, because otherwise, it\u0027s just boring to do what Dan Aykroyd did. And so I started with the monotone thing. It\u0027s sort of how you have to get into it is just, \"Bob Dole. Bob Dole pronounces, emphasizes every word about the same way. It\u0027s kind of like a test pattern, [? Dooooole. ?] That kind of thing.\""

And today, we bring you perspectives on Bob Dole. Because at this point, there\u0027s something oddly mesmerizing about what\u0027s going on in that campaign. Barely a day goes by without some odd quote or strange gaffe.",
            "Just at the end of this past week, there was a thing in the news how the Republicans have booked themself into a convention hall for the Republican Convention. And it\u0027s like 14 feet tall. And TV Guide was quoted in there saying that he doesn\u0027t want to make them look bad or anything, but there is literally no way to film them, to shoot them for TV, which is the entire point of a modern political convention. There\u0027s no way to shoot them without them looking like ants on a postage stamp.",

            "See, this is the kind of event the Bob Dole campaign should have staged when he turned 73 this past week. They should have surrounded him with lively, young people, a big, happy event celebrating his vigor. A few of you may not know that particular piece of tape. It\u0027s a pretty famous piece of tape. It\u0027s Marilyn Monroe singing to John Kennedy in 1963, which in my view, makes it even more appropriate for Bob Dole to use.",

            "That\u0027s The Handsome Family, a Chicago band. We\u0027ll have more campaign diaries from Michael Lewis in a second. First, I wanted to read a little bit from this piece written by Andrew Sullivan, also in The New Republic. Figured we\u0027re doing one, might as well do the other. It\u0027s this lovely little piece of writing from a couple weeks ago.",
            "He begins this thing by talking about this sketch that apparently, they\u0027re doing on Saturday Night Live. It\u0027s a spoof of MTV\u0027s show, The Real World. And in the real show, The Real World it\u0027s a bunch of young people in their 20s, Generation X-ers, living in a home somewhere. And they locate the home in different places.",
            "In the spoof, it\u0027s the same setup, except apparently, Bob Dole is living there with them. And then that\u0027s the big joke, that this gruff, 70-something person is living with the 20-somethings. And Andrew Sullivan makes the case, no, no, there\u0027s actually something to be learned from this. There\u0027s actually a deeper truth that we can find in this. He writes the following.",
            "\"Bob Dole, very unlike his rival for the presidency, is actually, I think, a natural Gen X-er, someone whose ironic detachment, bleak humor, and occasional bursts of dark sentiment make him far more intelligible to the under-35 crowd than most politicians. At 72, he is in some ways the ultimate 20-something candidate. To wit, his remarkable, revealing, and insistent use of that quintessential Generation X mantra, \u0027whatever.\u0027\"",
            "And then he\u0027s got a whole bunch of examples of Bob Dole using the word whatever, whoever, wherever, the various permutations. Here are some. Let\u0027s see.",
            "\"Well, I think Lowell Weicker probably did more in the Congress of the United States for disabled people in this country, children, adults, whatever.\" Or, \"That\u0027s one way to address it for some people. But you\u0027re right, all economic classes, whether you\u0027re white, black, whatever.\"",
            "The hint here, Andrew Sullivan writes, is that Bob Dole knows he\u0027s reciting a list of groups that he should feel deeply sincere about. But he can\u0027t at that moment feel completely sincere about them. So he gently undercuts the blather he\u0027s required to express by adding the W word.",
            "We know he\u0027s in favor of helping the poor, underprivileged, disabled, veterans, whomever. But we also know he\u0027s not exactly smitten with empathy for their plight as he utters the words. He cares, but with an understandable and often funny level of detachment.",
            "Compare with Clinton. A \"whatever\" barely passes the president\u0027s lips. There is nary a scintilla of detachment from his sympathy for everyone and anyone at all times, and indeed a fear, even panic, that anyone might suspect otherwise. Dole is different.",
            "Sullivan goes on in a little section of this to argue that this ironic distance is actually something admirable, in a certain way. He quotes a couple more examples of him saying \"whatever\" in different situations. He says, \"There are signs that Dole is aware of the complete silliness of much of what passes for political ritual. He knows that the throngs cheering for him today will be cheering for someone else tomorrow, that enthusiasm is fickle, that real support for someone like him always has something completely contingent about it. So he condescends to it under his breath in a throwaway, that wistful grin snickering up his face toward his black, darting eyes.",
            "Like the members of Generation X, Dole is post-just-about-everything. The difference, of course, is that he lived through it, and they were born after it. Dole, it\u0027s clear, has few illusions about the world. He\u0027s seen white-shirted revolutionaries have their moment and leave nothing but a deficit behind. His irony is not, as some boomers would have it, an expression of ennui or listlessness or cynicism. It\u0027s the sanest response to the real world, if you\u0027ll pardon the expression.",
            "Members of Generation X, despite the fashionable assumption, are not disillusioned. They\u0027re merely un-illusioned. Their wariness is endemic. Dole gets this. Clinton never will.\"",
            "Anyway, that\u0027s by Andrew Sullivan. Let\u0027s go to more of my Michael Lewis\u0027s campaign diaries.",
            "There we go. This first little diary entry is from back during the primaries. This is February 15. This is after the final New Hampshire debate. And this is this debate where there was this one moment where Dole kind of got into a little shouting match with Steve Forbes. Remember him?",
            "And Dole basically said to Forbes-- Forbes was running all these negative ads. And Dole\u0027s staff or Dole came up with this stunt where Dole would say \"Those ads are really inaccurate. And plus, if you\u0027re going to be talking about me, you could at least use a decent picture.\" And then Dole hands him these pictures, which Forbes snaps back at him, this and that.",
            "OK. So all that gets covered in the press. But after the debate, people leave. The stage is empty. And our little Michael Lewis heads out onto the stage. And he\u0027s looking at all the detritus left over, the notes the candidates write themselves, all this stuff that nobody else really bothers with writing about.",
            "And then he sees the photographs. I\u0027m going to read from this campaign diary, and then we\u0027ll go to Michael reading. He says, \"I noticed the photographs. They lay on the shelf beneath Forbes\u0027s podium. They were not prints but originals, curled and soiled, as if they\u0027d been sitting in some shoebox for years, until Dole stumbled across them late one night while he was worrying about how to retaliate against Steve Forbes in the big debate.",
            "Two are color, a bad one of Liddy, Dole\u0027s wife, who\u0027s stunning in the flesh, looking here tired and plain. A better one of dole\u0027s dog, Leader, rubbing noses with a yellow lab. The third is a black and white, of Dole smiling broadly, holding a baby. He looks 20 years younger. The black pen he clutches to keep his right arm in place juts up and is set off by the baby\u0027s white gown. Dole is looking at the camera. The baby is looking at Dole\u0027s gnarled, wounded hand.\" Here\u0027s Michael Lewis."

            "I asked five different Dole aides the identity of the baby held by Dole in the photograph he gave to Forbes. It seems an innocent enough query. After all, this was the picture Dole had selected for publication. I get no answer.",
            "The basic pose of the Dole campaign is the less anyone finds out about their candidate, the better. You can spot the Dole office in the row of glass boxes on the ground floor of the New Hampshire Holiday Inn. It\u0027s the one with the newspaper taped up on the glass to prevent people from outside looking in. Dole himself remains largely out of sight. He makes two or three very brief appearances each day and is otherwise unavailable for interviews.",
            "Dole\u0027s speeches add nothing to the general blank picture. A dozen times I listened to his talk, pen poised idly over paper. Nothing, not a thought, not an image, not a quote.",
            "It took me a while to figure out why this was, but then it struck me. Bob Dole wasn\u0027t running for president. The concept of Bob Dole was running. The man himself had subcontracted out all the dirty work to people who make their careers out of this sort of thing. That was why he was referring to himself in the third person. He wasn\u0027t there, at least not in any meaningful way.",
            "It turns out that everything I will discover about Bob Dole, I will discover by stealth. My first discovery? He\u0027s embarrassed by his own vanity. I catch him in a back room at one event, just before he\u0027s about to go onstage. He thinks no one is looking. He checks out his reflection furtively. His hair is sprayed and dyed. And then he whips out of his pocket a tiny canister and squirts two quick blasts of breath spray into his mouth.",
            "Also, his wit is genuine. It\u0027s not just an act. I stalk him through the snow at the world dog sledding championships and watch him meet and greet the pooches. A schoolgirl approaches as he\u0027s about to leave and after nabbing a photo, asks him if he\u0027s having fun. \"You learn a lot out here campaigning,\" Dole says, motioning to a sled of 20 dogs. \"They\u0027re all nice dogs, too, not like the Congress.\" He thinks no one is listening. He\u0027s said it just for the fun of it.",
            "All other data about Bob Dole must be inferred from the world he has created around himself. The Dole campaign consists of slick young men in blue suits, forever whispering to each other in dark corners. The campaign pays top dollar for everything. And I get the feeling that most who work for it have some personal financial stake in Dole soldiering on, and that they\u0027ll be the last to tell him that he really shouldn\u0027t be doing this again.",
            "You also get the feeling that there is very little the campaign would not do. One of their favorite techniques has been to hire telemarketing firms to call Buchanan supporters and, in the guise of pollsters, relate damning untruths. In response to Buchanan\u0027s complaints, the Dole people tell reporters that Buchanan is doing the calling to a few of his supporters to tar Dole. It takes a special sort of credulity to believe them. I stopped half a dozen people carrying Buchanan signs who told the same stories of strange phone calls in the night.",
            "One afternoon, I abandoned the Dole campaign for the steam room at the Manchester YMCA to purge myself of the dreadful feeling coming over me. A few minutes later, an extremely fat old man waddles in, spies me, drops his towel, and sits on a plastic stool right next to me. \"You\u0027re a new face,\" he says. \"I always notice a new face.\" I say, \"That\u0027s nice,\" grab for a towel, and tell him I came for the campaign.",
            "He shifts on his stool and says, \"I\u0027m a Buchanan man, myself.\" Buchanan men are the kind of guys who can sidle up to other guys in steam rooms without the slightest fear of being thought gay. Moments later, he\u0027s complaining about the calls he\u0027s getting at home. Here, roughly, is what he said.",
            "\"A guy calls. He says, \u0027Hi. My name is William, and I\u0027m calling from the Dole campaign. Are you aware that Pat Buchanan is an extremist?\u0027 And I say, \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 And he says, \u0027Pat wants to give nuclear weapons to South Korea and Japan.\u0027",
            "So I ask him, \u0027Where does this information come from.\u0027 He says he doesn\u0027t know. So I ask him, \u0027What does Bob Dole think about that?\u0027 And this kid doesn\u0027t know that, either. He knows absolutely nothing about Bob Dole.",
            "So I ask, \u0027Who are you, anyway?\u0027 And he says he\u0027s with an organization called the National Research Institute in Houston. So I ask him for his phone number. And he says he can\u0027t give it to me. Then he hangs up. There is, of course, no listing in Houston for the National Research Institute.\"",
            "In short, the Dole campaign is a lot like what a lot of people probably suspect the Buchanan campaign is, closed, secretive, smug, a bit nasty. Maybe that\u0027s what happens when you lose once too often. You stop trusting the voters.",
            "And yet I still want badly to like Dole. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s the guy in the race that people most badly want to like, but can\u0027t quite figure out how to do it. Every night after a day with Dole, I return home and recall to my mind a pair of mental images that the day has badly blemished. The first is the one of Dole recuperating from his war wounds, as described by Richard Ben Cramer, hanging by his bad right arm and trying to straighten it out until he was sweating and crying from pain. The second is a windy afternoon last June in a graveyard on the French coast, when, Dole now says, he realized he had to run for president one last time.",
            "I traveled there on Clinton\u0027s plane to witness the D-Day celebrations. But about halfway through, I lost interest in writing about it and just started watching. You gaze down the cliff onto the beach and just marvel. How did these men do this?",
            "Just before Clinton addressed the veterans of the Normandy invasion, I found myself walking alone through the rows of white crosses, until I reached a place where there was no one else but a pair of veterans. They seemed ancient, though of course, they could not have been much older than Bob Dole. They were trembling and leaning on each other as they looked down on a cross. And at first, I thought it was just from the strains of age.",
            "Then I saw the name and place on the cross, Stenson, I\u0027ll say, from Mississippi. The boy had died at the age of 19 on the first day of the invasion. The old men wore name tags, too. Stenson, from Mississippi.",
            "Two of three brothers had survived that day. They were crying without tears. That\u0027s a bit like Dole, I would like to believe. He\u0027s crying without tears. He has the emotions, or at least, you can sense them lurking inside them. But he has no idea how to give them proper expression.",
            "February 19. The act, I should say, is always the same. The announcer brings on stage, one at a time, all the politicians who have endorsed Dole. They race out onto the stage like ballplayers before a game. Dole waits in the background until the crowd reaches a low fever pitch. A quick squirt of the breath spray, and he\u0027s on.",
            "He stands at the podium with his left foot and left side jutted forward, though he\u0027s right-handed. His crippled right hand rests on the podium, but it\u0027s not a prop. He\u0027ll start in with something self-deprecating. \"That\u0027s a lot better than the speech is going to be.\" Something like that.",
            "Presently, the voice of Dole emanates from the Milford, New Hampshire, town hall\u0027s facade. It\u0027s not so much a speech as a series of disconnected phrases uttered in an elegiac tone, some of which cause the people around me to break out into giggles. \"Like everyone else in this room, I was born,\" Dole says. A Dole speech sounds like the sort of thing a red brick building would say if a red brick building could speak.",
            "He pulls the rhythms of his \"one America\" refrain up short, just as it starts to flow. \"We\u0027re not rich. We\u0027re not poor. We\u0027re not urban. We\u0027re not rural. We\u0027re not black. We\u0027re not white. You can go on and on and on.\" I have a dream, kind of. And gentleman in England now abed, well, I don\u0027t know. Maybe they should just get up.",
            "It is more like the Cliff Notes of a great speech than the speech itself. The only lines Dole can deliver with any kind of strength sound like they were cribbed from Robert\u0027s Rules of Order. \"Start the hearings. Go through the process. Do it in an orderly way.\"",
            "The whole time Dole is speaking, it is as if he is saying, \"This is the speech I would give to you if I was the sort of person who gives speeches.\" I\u0027m not sure whether Dole is actually modest or simply embarrassed by immodesty. I leave thinking that a man like this runs for the presidency not because he thinks he should be president. He thinks no one else should be president, so it might as well be him.",
            "May 27. You never saw a more unhappy-looking group than the journalists assigned to follow Dole into New Jersey on Memorial Day. \"I got the best seat in the house to the worst show in town,\" rumbles a cameraman as we board the plane at National Airport. \"I just came in case he got shot or something,\" says a reporter, who doesn\u0027t even bother to take notes.",
            "I, too, have my misgivings. Usually, my campaign notebooks are crammed with anecdotes, observations, and incidents. Whenever I\u0027m with Dole, however, they simply refuse to fill up. The Dole campaign remains an arid, sterile place. Not much grows there.",
            "Today is a kind of prelude to the general campaign, which will be relaunched in earnest tomorrow with a bold journey across the country. Dole marches for a dozen blocks through Clifton, New Jersey, in front of the parade\u0027s single float, bookended by his wife, Elizabeth, and Governor Christie Todd Whitman. The crowd is quiet and sparse, less than one deep.",
            "The parade climaxes in a park, where Dole is meant to make a few remarks and lay a wreath on a symbolic grave site. I wait there for him, watching members of the local veterans organization subtly jockey for position. Six old men form the color guard, dressed in red jackets, VFW caps covered with patches and buttons, and the apprehensive air of people who fear they might be asked to improvise.",
            "But the really striking thing about them is how old they look, at least compared to Dole. They could almost be a different generation. \"Any veterans of the first World War here?\" I ask. \"We just buried our last one last fall,\" says one, who sports a POW-MIA pin in his cap. \"Don\u0027t come around here 10 years from now,\" says the man beside him, \"or we won\u0027t be here, either.\"",
            "May 28. It turns out that we are flying all the way across the country to spend less than 24 hours in California before picking up and flying back. First to Chicago, where we\u0027ll spend tomorrow night, and then to Ohio, on May the 28th, five months before the election. The only reason it doesn\u0027t seem insane is that several hundred seemingly sober men in dark suits follow Dole wherever he goes. There is a kind of ambitious young person who mistakes frenetic movement for advancement in the world. They\u0027ll call you from the road and say, \"I\u0027m in Bangladesh on business, heading for Iceland.\" And you know that he thinks this is sufficient explanation of his purpose in life.",
            "The Dole campaign has something of this feeling. As long as the candidate keeps moving, everyone traveling with him is exempt from serious self-examination. Which is a shame, since they have no idea why they are doing what they are doing. It\u0027s frequent flyer politics.",
            "And within a couple of hours, I\u0027m having my first Admiral Stockdale moment. Who am I? What am I doing here?",
            "Early the second morning, we descend, in our motorcade of 13 cars and 2 buses, on a seemingly tranquil park in Redondo Beach. The point of the event and the trip is to illustrate that Dole is against crime. The trouble is that Clinton is against crime, too. So Dole needs to show that he\u0027s more fervently against crime than Clinton, who at this very moment is on route to New Orleans to deliver his own anti-crime speech. Dole and Clinton are like Time and Newsweek. No matter how much they claim to differ, they still run the same covers, week after week.",
            "The park is being celebrated as an example of a neighborhood reclaiming public space from urban violence. But as various political dignitaries loudly disapprove of drive-by shootings, a small group of dissenters forms on the fringe. All but one are the Hispanics who bear the brunt of the new anti-crime esprit. They\u0027re hauled off to jail for all sorts of odd crimes, carrying baseball bats into the park after 7 o\u0027clock in the evening, for instance.",
            "The exception is a gentle old soul named Art Campbell, who for decades has cleaned the park, coached the local kids, and groomed the playing fields. The ball field at the center of the park is named for him. Art Campbell is a Dole supporter. \"I\u0027m for the man,\" he says. \"I don\u0027t go by the party.\" But he\u0027s mildly perplexed by the anti-crime rally. \"It isn\u0027t as bad as all that,\" he says.",
            "A policeman on the scene confirms that the crime statistics in Redondo Beach are in line with those of the nation as a whole. Violent crime has declined steadily here, as it has in other cities, over the past 20 years. More to the point, he cannot recall a single violent crime in the park. \"A few years ago, someone shot a gun in the air as he drove past the park,\" he says, \"But no one was hurt.\"",
            "Campbell stops the park custodian, a Hispanic man who speaks poor English. \"Do you think this Dole thing is a good idea?\" he asks the man. The man takes one look at my notepad and says, \"I no want to say.\" He\u0027s afraid of offending his employers. The greatest fear in the park is the fear of offending the people on the platform who are spearheading the anti-crime initiative.",
            "Having successfully fed, and fed off of, the fear of crime, we wearily board the bus. I am now certain that nothing interesting will ever occur in the close-cropped frame of the staged Dole event. Where do politics come from, anyway? Not from listening to Bob Dole deliver a speech written by someone else to a group of people he knows nothing about in a place to which he\u0027ll never return.",
            "Many of the criticisms about Dole can be made of Clinton, too, of course. You can\u0027t say anything about Dole\u0027s use of push polls, or about the cynicism of his staged events, without having some seasoned reporter look at you as if you were a child and say, \"So what? They all do that.\"",
            "The next week, the New York Times will carry a putatively positive piece about Dole\u0027s campaign manager, Scott Reed. Toward the end of it, almost by-the-by, we read this astonishing revelation about Dole\u0027s senate resignation. Quote, \"The element of surprise was essential, Mr. Dole and Reed decided, if the announcement were to appear bold and make an impression on voters. \u0027If it had leaked,\u0027 Mr. Reed said, \u0027he probably wouldn\u0027t have done it.\u0027\"",
            "Think of it. Just a few weeks ago, the man stood before us and brought tears to our eyes by saying that you do not lay claim to the office you hold. It lays claim to you. Your obligation is to bring to it the gifts you can, of labor and honesty, and then to part with grace.",
            "But according to Reed, Dole\u0027s decision to end his wonderful senate career was baldly conceived as a PR stunt. Journalists are often accused of being cynical. But the cynicism of journalists does not compare to that of serious presidential candidates."

            "And Dan Aykroyd kind of does the bully Dole from the \u002770s. Dole back then was sort of a Nixon protege. And then I figured I\u0027d take it a little further and make it a little munchkin-like.",
            "\"Because Bob Dole tends to, when he rolls, when he keeps going, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], you\u0027ll be hist-- you\u0027ll be hist-- you\u0027ll be history.\" That kind of thing. Then I figured out that Bob Dole is actually the tree from The Wizard of Oz. He\u0027s not a munchkin. He\u0027s actually--",
            "Mayor of Munchkinland, you know. \"And she\u0027s not really, really dead. She\u0027s really most sincerely dead.\" Kind of sounds like Bob Dole. \"Not really-diddily dead. She\u0027s really-- let me tell you something. Bill Clinton\u0027s campaign is dead.\"",
            "But anyway, what he\u0027s really like is The Wizard of Oz tree, which is, \"I\u0027m Bob Dole. How\u0027d you like it if somebody took apples off of you?\"",
            "[LAUGHTER]",
            "You know, he\u0027s even got the same expression as the tree. And he\u0027s tragic in the way the tree is. People are constantly pulling apples off, and they\u0027re not tasting them. I\u0027ve got about five minutes more on this analogy.",
            "Pshaw. Nonsense, Conan O\u0027Brien. Now you listen to me. Bob Dole wasn\u0027t last night. Bob Dole\u0027s the new president of the United States, that\u0027s right.",
            "Dole\u0027s on a roll. Dole topped the polls. That\u0027s right. Dole\u0027s in control. Dole\u0027s riding a bull-Dole-zer. Shoot that punk. Shoot that punk, smoke that Dole.",
            "On Conan? Yeah.",
            "Oh, well, I\u0027m just imagining his deepest thoughts. And he\u0027s just letting them out at 12:30 at night, when no one\u0027s watching. That\u0027s sort of the premise. Like, \"Bob Dole\u0027s the next president of the United States. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Sing with me, O\u0027Brien.\" And I would make him sing, you know, \"Happy Happy Dole Dole.\"",
            "--Dole de-Dole de-Dole.",
            "Dole de-Dole, Dole de-Dole. Dole-de--",
            "Dole.",
            "When I do a politician on that show, I\u0027m almost always doing the id of that politician. It\u0027s basically nonsense. And sometimes I just have Dole giggling, and just--",
            "Bow down to me, Conan O\u0027Brien. Bow down to the next senate majority leader, most powerful man in the world.",
            "Yeah, I really-- it\u0027s hard not to like Bob Dole anyway. I mostly feel sorry for him. To me, it just seems like it\u0027s only going to get worse for Bob Dole. At the point where he\u0027s supposed to catch up, where everybody expects that it\u0027s going to tighten, that\u0027s when they\u0027re going to debate. And Bob Dole needs to have a 20-point lead before they start debating.",
            "Unconsciously, yeah, sometimes. I just got a puppy, and I find it very effective training.",
            "Very effective, just when I put on the Bob Dole voice at the puppy. \"Sit! You listen to me, puppy. You poop.\"",
            "My tombstone will say \"Da Corpse,\" I think.",
            "That\u0027s right. That\u0027s how I used the Bob Dole thing there. He\u0027s lost track of who Bob Dole is. \"Why won\u0027t Bob Dole debate me? Bob Dole is hiding. Somebody--\" And then he turned around and started yelling at the people behind him, like he thought they were the audience all the sudden.",
            "Well, we\u0027ve made fun of that on the Conan show, too, you know.",
            "Yeah. Well, we\u0027ve segued from him going, \"I tell you, Bill Clinton\u0027s going to jail. Hillary Clinton\u0027s going to jail. Socks the cat\u0027s going to jail. Oh, what am I talking about? What\u0027s happening to Dole?",
            "Like that, O\u0027Brien? That\u0027s a new Dole. New Dole cries. New Dole cries. Boo-hoo. Like it?\" This man has cried more-- I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a politician who\u0027s cried in public more than Bob Dole. It\u0027s such an amazing flip side to the guy, who\u0027s looked down as such a hardass.",
            "Nixon\u0027s funeral. He cried in Russell, Kansas. He cried a little bit when he announced his resignation this year from the senate. And he cried when he went to Russell, Kansas. I mean, that\u0027s twice this spring. And then he cried at Nixon\u0027s funeral.",
            "[LAUGHTER]",
            "Do I buy it? Yeah. Well, I buy the Nixon\u0027s funeral one. There didn\u0027t seem to be any political upside in that one.",
            "So if you buy that one, then you have to think that it\u0027s possible that he was sincere in the other two. I can imagine the senate one would be hard for him. The Russell, Kansas thing, that stretches credibility a little bit. Because basically, he only goes to Russell, Kansas to cry. Supposedly he\u0027s never there except to make a speech once every eight years, when he runs for president.",
            "Got to go to Russell. Oh my god, I\u0027m feeling a little bummed.",
            "You mean just physical moves?",
            "All right. Well, Bob Dole, I sort of walked you through Bob Dole. Start with the test pattern, \"Nnnnn.\"",
            "\"Dole, and everything is monotone after that. And he says the same thing in the same tone of voice, speaks very rapidly, Dole.\" And then putting an \"Nn\" before the Dole makes him seem older. \"Nn-Dole,\" that kind of thing.",
            "Well, it depends on how far you want to take one. If you want to do the crazy Clinton, then that\u0027s easy. You start with Bruce Springsteen.",
            "And it\u0027s just, \"Hey, little Mary with your daddy home. Hey, man. How you doing? How\u0027s it going, everybody? Whee-haw.\"",
            "But then there\u0027s more of a-- the more accurate Clinton is kind of the caring guy who\u0027s just sort of a gentle thing. And it takes very little, very little energy. You just barely, barely breathe, hardly at all.",
            "When I\u0027m doing this, yeah. I feel the air. That\u0027s very good, yes. I feel the air pushing toward the back of my throat.",
            "Instantly, I thought of Dan Aykroyd\u0027s impression, which was ingrained in my head from working at Saturday Night Live. And what I try to do is find something and take it further, because otherwise, it\u0027s just boring to do what Dan Aykroyd did. And so I started with the monotone thing. It\u0027s sort of how you have to get into it is just, \"Bob Dole. Bob Dole pronounces, emphasizes every word about the same way. It\u0027s kind of like a test pattern, [? Dooooole. ?] That kind of thing.\""

            "So then there\u0027s this whole thing about Katie Couric\u0027s interview of the Doles, and how she didn\u0027t stick to her script and just talk about the book that the Doles have written, which I guess was Elizabeth Dole\u0027s cue to start talking about the book, which she did. And she reads the inscription she wrote to Larry King, which goes \"To Larry. Here\u0027s hoping that Larry King Live will be broadcast live from the Dole White House, 7-15-96. And your program is mentioned in the book, Larry.\"",
            "I totally think that Elizabeth Dole is shaking down Larry King. Maybe he won\u0027t be interviewing the Gores or the Clintons because Elizabeth Dole gave him the plug in the book and that emphatic, sternly scolding \"Larry\" at the end. And then Larry King points his gatling gun mouth at Elizabeth, who, with a big old smile on her face, is like, \"I thought we were there to talk about the book, Larry.\" Like, how harsh is Elizabeth Dole? I seriously would never want to be on Elizabeth Dole\u0027s bad side.",
            "Next, they\u0027re going on and on about how badly the campaign is doing. And Elizabeth Dole is talking about how no one is engaged because it\u0027s summer vacation. And Larry King is all, \"Well, you know the media. Today\u0027s mistake is tomorrow\u0027s headline.\" And how weird to hear Mr. Media Manipulation himself talk about the goings-on of the media as if they are a totally natural state of affairs that he himself has nothing to do with. How annoying is that?",
            "And then Bob Dole, instead of casually dropping his buzzwords one by one into the conversation, just reels off a whole bunch of them wholesale. And meanwhile, Larry King is still stuck on the whole tax thing and is trying to pin Bob dole down. And I have to wonder whether Larry King has really bad breath or something, because Bob Dole kept making these faces as if that might be the case.",
            "So then Elizabeth Dole is talking about Bob Dole\u0027s message and Bob Dole\u0027s agenda, and then it\u0027s her turn to start reeling off a list of agenda bullet points. And then Bob Dole basically says that without television, a politician can\u0027t campaign, which is a pretty scary thing, if you ask me. And then he adds in all the bullet points of what Bill Clinton has done wrong so far. And then Bob Dole is saying how he\u0027s glad to be the underdog and that the real campaign is going to kick off with a powerful acceptance speech by Bob Dole at the Republican National Convention.",
            "And then Bob Dole announces that Susan Molinari is going to be the keynote speaker, since she is young and dynamic. And Elizabeth Dole adds that Molinari believes strongly in what Bob Dole stands for. And it\u0027s almost at the point where if you couldn\u0027t see the TV picture, you might very well wonder if Bob Dole is still in the room or not, since everyone, including Bob Dole, keeps saying \"Bob Dole.\"",
            "Meanwhile, Larry King is milking the whole Susan Molinari thing. And he\u0027s like, \"That\u0027s a big statement about cities.\" And Bob Dole adds women to that list. And then he starts going on and on about all this stuff he\u0027s done for women all these years.",
            "And all I know is that I was taking the M7 uptown bus the other day, and we were going through Midtown. And there were these two women seated in front of me. And in Midtown, there\u0027s this big clock which shows a readout of the national debt getting higher and higher. And this one woman is like, \"Look, the national debt just gets higher and higher.\" Like maybe they should take the money that everyone saves with MCI, which is another huge number readout in Midtown, and put that money toward paying off the national debt.",
            "So then she asks her friend, \"Who are you voting for?\" And the second lady is like, \"I don\u0027t like the situation we\u0027re in one bit. I don\u0027t see anyone with any high morals or good ideas, and I don\u0027t like Bob Dole. I don\u0027t like his stance on issues. Plus, I think he\u0027s too old.\"",
            "And the first lady\u0027s like \"Too old.\" And the second lady is like, \"Too old. He would be a one-term president.\" And the other lady is like, \"Definitely a one-term president.\" So maybe Bob Dole should ride around on New York mass transit to get a sense of what he should be doing. And then Bob Dole goes on about what he\u0027s done for women, saying, \"I\u0027ve been living with a woman,\" which was a really, really weird thing to say.",
            "So then we get an advertisement about health insurance sponsored by the Republican National Committee, showing this smirking kid breathing through a tube while his mother goes on about what we need. And then there\u0027s a commercial for life insurance featuring these crying statues in the rain. And I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s such a good idea to remind people about sickness and death when Bob Dole is on the program.",
            "And Larry King brings up Susan Molinari again, like, \"Yeah, Larry, we get your little prearranged scoop. Quit working it so much.\" And Larry King is like, \"How did you get involved in this tobacco thing?\" And Bob Dole is like, \"Just blew in, I guess.\" And then you realize that Bob Dole keeps looking at himself in the monitor, or else someone is there backstage that he\u0027s looking at for cues.",
            "And how sick is it to refer to the undeniable pull of tobacco company money in Bob Dole\u0027s pocket as something that \"just blew in\"? And then Bob Dole says he\u0027s not a scientist and so couldn\u0027t know that smoking is addictive, which is weird, because later he refers to relatives who were sick due to smoking-related problems. How much evidence do you personally need, Bob Dole?",
            "And then Larry King is like, \"Would you tell Americans to stop smoking?\" And Bob Dole is like, \"Yeah, all of you stop smoking.\" And Elizabeth Dole qualifies that with \"pregnant women and elderly people with respiratory disorders.\" Where do you think most respiratory disorders come from, Elizabeth Dole?",
            "And then Bob Dole is like, \"It\u0027s not good for you. It\u0027s bad for your health. Don\u0027t do it.\" And having said that, like he was about to go on, but Elizabeth Dole interrupts him and goes, \"That\u0027s it.\" And they all laugh. And we get an arthritis pain medication commercial and a denture cream commercial.",
            "So then Larry King is asking Elizabeth Dole about what she\u0027s going to be doing as First Lady. And she starts going on about being a supportive spouse. And Bob Dole makes a joke about calling her up for a transfusion. And then he looks at the monitor again. And meanwhile, Elizabeth Dole is going on about going around the country to places where mentally challenged youths are making beautiful products. And I swear to god, if she got any more condescending, I was going to seriously put my foot through the television.",
            "So then Bob Dole goes on the record as not speaking about Clinton\u0027s character by listing Whitewater and Filegate as two things he hasn\u0027t talked about, even though he just did. And then Larry King brings up more records. And then Bob Dole goes, \"Trust.\"",
            "And then Elizabeth Dole starts going on about how Bob Dole was a poor farmboy whose family moved their kids into the basement to rent out the house to make ends meet. How depressing is that? No wonder Bob Dole has a sour demeanor all the time, since he grew up with no windows.",
            "And then Elizabeth Dole goes on some more, like maybe she should let her husband talk just a little bit. And then Larry King brings up the Jimmy Carter question. \"Can you say you would never tell a lie?\" And Bob Dole goes, \"Yes.\" And Elizabeth Dole goes, \"Yes.\" Whose question is that?",
            "And then they go on and on about affirmative action. And then Larry King promises to take phone calls for, like, the 50th time. Maybe no one is calling in or something. And then we get that health insurance commercial again and an ad for some ginseng-based energizing dietary supplement to help you feel not so old.",
            "Next, they\u0027re talking about the stock market. And we finally go to calls, but Larry doesn\u0027t seem to know how to work the phones. And the caller\u0027s from Georgia. And I was hoping it was that guy who called up when Jesse Helms was on, thanking him for all his work in controlling blacks, only he didn\u0027t say blacks. But it was only some guy asking about running mates again. The one call that they take on the show, and it is some yokel who didn\u0027t get that they weren\u0027t going to talk about possible running mates.",
            "So finally, we get Susan Molinari on the phone from a restaurant somewhere, gushing on and on about Bob Dole to the point where they probably should have cut her off. And Larry King asks whether Susan Molinari thinks her pro-choice abortion stand is going to be a problem. And Susan Molinari is going on about how, \"This is the man to bring the convention together, and there is no greater honor in the world than to speak on behalf of the gentleman currently on your show.\" You would think Susan Molinari just found God or something, the way she was going on about it.",
            "And all I want to know is does Susan Molinari on the phone to Larry King count as a paid Republican advertisement for Bob Dole, especially when Larry King points out that Bob Dole is the guest who\u0027s appeared most on the Larry King show? And then Larry King makes a point of reminding all the news flunkies out there that the two points from his show to remember are \"Never lie\" and \"Susan Molinari.\" And I don\u0027t think November could be any scarier in my mind at this point.",
            "So I\u0027m watching Larry King Live the other night, and Bob Dole is wearing a dark gray suit and a powerish, reddish tie. And Elizabeth Dole is wearing a blue, blue dress and Red Cross red lipstick, which I guess means she\u0027s going for that red, white, and blue effect. And the first question is about the statement made by somebody that Hillary should debate Elizabeth.",
            "And Bob Dole is like, \"It was a joke.\" And Elizabeth Dole is like, \"It was in jest, Larry.\" And then Elizabeth Dole goes on and on about how the emphasis should be on the presidential candidates, which is funny, because she doesn\u0027t let poor Bob Dole get a word in edgewise.",
            "So next, Larry King is asking whether there are any women on \"the list\" for vice president, since Elizabeth Dole said that in our lifetime, there would be women presidential candidates. And Bob Dole goes on and on about his process for picking a VP. And Larry King, sounding like someone out of The Godfather, is like, \"But you know all of these guys. What do you need a process for?\"",
            "And Bob Dole starts to list the things he looks for in a vice president. And two of them are health and age, which I thought kind of weird. Like maybe Bob Dole shouldn\u0027t be allowed to say the words health and age at all. And all I could imagine was a room full of Dole campaign handlers in Larry King\u0027s green room going \"Damn!\" at the top of their lungs."
