What are you looking at? Oh, you got something? What do you be about? And started asking them what their affiliation is, and other stuff. And we started talking [BLEEP] to them and other stuff. And they pulled out a gun, and they said OK, you want to talk [BLEEP] now? Let\u0027s talk [BLEEP]. And I panicked. I mean, nobody had ever pulled a gun on me. I was like, holy [BLEEP], and I just started kind of running around, and I was like, oh my god, they\u0027re going to kill us. They\u0027re actually going to kill us. It had finally sunk in that somebody was going to kill us, that that would be it, the end of my life. At like 14, somebody was going to kill me."

So everybody just kind of spread out, and I ran, and I lost my shoes, and my jacket, my purse. I lost everything. I was just like throwing things off me to make me lighter so I could run faster. And finally I jumped into a dumpster, and I stood there. And I must have stood there a good hour, hour and a half. And I just stood there and prayed and shaked, and tried to not make noise. And I heard them run past me, and run past me, and screaming \"bitch\" and looking for people. And I was there, and I was praying to God that they didn\u0027t open the dumpster and find me, because if they would have, I think I would have been dead."

Did that mean I was supposed to be a monk? Did that mean I was supposed to be an evangelist? Did that mean that I had to immediately renounce all that I had and get into sackcloth and ashes and march out into the desert? All of that was left unopened, and that is in fact what occupied my mind as I went back to my hostel to lay down and think about, because I had no clue what it really meant to me ultimately."

And I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a voice, but there was an idea that came into my mind that just would not go away. And that was that I should live as if I would die in six months, that I should really truly live. And that I could not tell for certain whether I would really die, but that either way I should live as if I was going to die. And so that was the assignment."

And after thinking the thought that I should live as if I was going to die in six months, the first thought that comes to my head was, well that\u0027s pretty silly. You have no evidence whatsoever. I could live like I\u0027m going to die in six months and not die at all. It would just be kind of an interesting exercise. But at the same time, it was equally probable that I might die in six months. It happened all the time. There was no guarantee that I wouldn\u0027t die. And so fairly quickly I decided that I could not settle that issue of whether I would really die or not, or just think that I was going to die in six months. And that in either case, the important thing was to live as if I really believed that I was going to die in six months. Which is what I set out to do."

And the answers to that surprised me as much as the assignment. Because after thinking that through and contemplating it, the conclusion that I came to was that what I wanted to do for six months was to go home and be ordinary, to go back to my parents, to help them take out the trash and trim the hedges and move furniture around, and to be with them."

And yet I found myself relishing the ordinariness and finding it in some ways as exotic as anything that I had traveled to see. And so I was involved in-- I helped around the house. I dug up shrubs. I worked on a deck. I moved furniture, washed dishes, and I was intending to kind of spend my last remaining six months at home getting to know my parents better, and myself hopefully."

I had four brothers and sisters, and they were scattered all across the country. And so I felt very strongly that I wanted to see them before I died. And I got the idea that the way to see them was to ride my bicycle across the country and visit them on bicycle."

And I had some money left over, and one of the things that I did with that money was I went to the bank and got some cashier\u0027s checks for like $500 and $1,000. And I mailed the money to various people anonymously as gifts. And I think giving away those thousands of dollars was the first true act of charity I had ever done, because there was absolutely no way for any kind of gratitude or elevated feelings to come back to me, because people had no idea who had sent them that money."

And so there\u0027s this sort of like the suspicion of charity, suspicion of goodness, that starts to infect the people that are around you. And you look at someone, you think, hmm, I wonder if he gave me that $1,000?"

If he was real, then how could we ignore him? And if we were trying to not ignore him, what do we do? And if he was real, then what about these other things that people said about God?"

There are some people who like to slip into the past as a means to perhaps fantasize or escape, and they find that the past is the place that they retreat to. And I often retreat to the future. I was not a person who planned or had a career staged out, or who had a particular woman he wanted to marry someday, or some vision of a house. The future that I found so hard to give up was a much more insidious type. It was that of-- I like to buy this record because in the future I want to hear the song again and again. Or I will read this book, and there\u0027s some cool ideas in it because someday I may write an article about this, and it\u0027s kind of good to know that."

And I fought it day by day, and tooth by tooth."
    },
    {
      "speakerName": "Kevin Kelly",
      "text": "One of the ways I dealt with this was that I was actually able by the last weeks to not think about my life beyond Halloween. There was a way in which I had just-- each time a thought came up about something that was beyond this horizon, I just said, nope, can\u0027t think about, it doesn\u0027t work. We have to dwell in the present. And at the same time I was doing that-- and I was able to do that-- I also decided that it was entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live, and that having a future is part of what being human is about, and that when you take away the future for humans, you take away a lot of their humanness. And that it\u0027s not actually a very good thing to live entirely in the present, that one needs to have a past, and one needs to have a future to be fully human."

He was making drawings and writing haikus along the way, and as he went across the country, they became more and more dark, more and more preoccupied with death. And as he traveled across the country, the other thing is that he always had to find a place to stay every night. And at first he just tried what he had done in Jerusalem. That is, he would just find a church, and he would camp out on the church lawn. But people got upset at that."

And he\u0027d go up to a house, and he\u0027d say hi, this is who I am. I\u0027m bicycling across the country. I\u0027ve just eaten dinner, he would say so they wouldn\u0027t feel obligated to feed him. Can I camp out in back? And invariably they would say yes, and invariably they would also at some point invite him in for coffee."

It was to tell them how great a time I was having, because if I wasn\u0027t having a great time they were really disappointed, because I was riding for them. I was vicariously doing what they had always wanted their lives to do, and so the more I enjoyed my time, and the more in the present I was living, the more they enjoyed it, and the more it uplifted them. And so that was basically my job."
    },
    {
      "speakerName": "Kevin Kelly",
      "text": "It was a journey that began at the tomb of Jesus, and as I set off to my own presumed death, I did indeed think about Jesus Christ. We have the history in the Gospels of Jesus\u0027 torment in his soul as he approached what he knew of his anointed time to die. So it was again that very harsh information of knowing when you\u0027re going to die. And Jesus\u0027 soul was in great turmoil and pain because of knowing that. And I think I did experience some of that, not because I had the same weight. That was just my own life. But Jesus prayed that this burden be lifted, and there were days when I did pray that, that if I didn\u0027t have to die, I really would rather not."

And as each day went on, I was coming closer and closer to terrain that I was familiar with and that felt like home. And I was riding into New Jersey, and I was elated. I was elated that I had accomplished this long journey, and I was elated that I was home to see my parents."

I think we had a wonderful dinner. They were, of course, glad to see me, because they hadn\u0027t seen me in a long time. They knew I was coming back, and we had a wonderful dinner.

It was just about I think talking about our family, and my brothers and sisters, and I was telling them all that I had learned about them. And so it was a very together and, again, not a very dramatic evening, but just a pleasant one, the kind of one that you might have a memory about as you were dying.

And at that point I\u0027d fully gone through in my own mind, my own soul, all the things that I might have regretted, and I had righted as many of those as I thought I could through letters.

It was if I had been transported back into the 15th century, because all the souvenir vendors were gone, and what was left were the labyrinthine paths of cobbled passageways. And I wandered around for a number of hours, and it was getting colder. Eventually I found myself at the one place that was still open, which was some of the churches.

        "[INAUDIBLE] In April of 1996, how did your day begin the day that you got shot?",
        "He was being a big brat. He\u0027s laying down on the bed, and I\u0027m sitting on his wheelchair, and I\u0027m interviewing him. And he keeps trying to grab the microphone from me.",
        "Tell me what happened, like what you see, what you thought of that moment when you got shot? What happened?",
        "That is so stupid. Let go of me.",
        "I had to open up the story. I had to take him back so he could remember.",
        "This is is a show Claudia Perez is doing on my brother Javier.",
        "Well, it was April 2 or April 6 of \u002796, and he had come to the house in the morning. And he had bought some gym shoes, and he was showing off, ha ha, look, I got some gym shoes. And you\u0027re not supposed to buy gym shoes because that\u0027s not fair, because you\u0027re not buying stuff for my little brother. And I was like, you\u0027re being greedy. Something\u0027s going to happen to you for being greedy.",
        "And I remember that I felt weird that day. You know how they say women have this kind of sense? I don\u0027t know, but I felt weird.",
        "One of his friends, they were going to go party at a bar, and they went towards the back of the gangway. They were over there in the back of the gangway, and--",
        "A house. Of a house.",
        "Yeah. And they were just all talking there, and the guy stuck out the gun to my brother, and my brother tried to take it from his hand.",
        "No, they were all just over there in the back of the gangway. They were talking, and he tried to rob my brother. And my brother tried to take the gun from him, and the guy did it. While my brother was trying to run, he shot him in the stomach, which hit his spinal cord.",
        "When he was in the ICU unit, he looked real bad. And he was like all bloody, and blood was coming out, whatever. And he\u0027s dark-skinned, my brother. And at the ICU he looked pale. He had no color. And my mom was crying, because she\u0027s like, \"Oh, my son. He\u0027s Negrito, like he\u0027s dark-skinned. Where\u0027s his color at? Where\u0027s his color?\" And she was crying, \"Where\u0027s my son\u0027s color at?\" And begging, \"Oh, my son\u0027s not dark no more. Got to give him his color back, because we will know that he\u0027s healthy with his color back.\"",
        "What was your reaction to that? How did it make you feel?",
        "He usually talks about it freely, nice. But I guess because it\u0027s me he won\u0027t talk about it normally, because me and him, we never talk about it. I want him to tell me, because I never asked him that before. And I wanted him to tell me something that I always wanted to know, and I was mad, because he gave me a dumb answer. I thought, then tell me something more--",
        "Yeah, and he didn\u0027t tell me that. He just made me feel like, oh, my god, you\u0027re never going to change, or something.",
        "What have you learned from this experience?",
        "Shut up. No wonder your friends can\u0027t listen to this.",
        "Do you appreciate life more now?",
        "He\u0027s changed, yeah. He doesn\u0027t drink anymore. He thinks more about the future, like before he would go day by day.",
        "Not at all, and you could drink when you\u0027re paralyzed. You could. He says he doesn\u0027t smoke.",
        "He don\u0027t want to. He says that he feels stupid. He looks at-- before, he used to go out with his boys and all his friends. He\u0027s never seen how stupid they look. And now that he doesn\u0027t drink, he sees how stupid they are, and that there\u0027s no point to drink and get like that anymore. He says that-- one day he told me that if he ever walked again, he wouldn\u0027t take it for granted. He told me that once. He goes, I\u0027ll kiss the ground, or something like that. He told me once.",
        "And I was like, whoa, because we never talk like nice to each other. We\u0027re always fighting or something about something. And that one day that he told me that, I was like, oh. I felt weird. When he talks nice to me, it feels weird. Like when I was doing the interview, I couldn\u0027t look at him, because I was like, oh, you get on my nerves. It\u0027s that kind of thing, like we love each other, but we can\u0027t stand each other. And when we fight, he still beats me up, even though he\u0027s in a wheelchair. He still beats me up. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s strange.",
        "People tell me, how can he beat you up still? And I\u0027m like, he does.",
        "I don\u0027t know. He does. I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s just real-- it\u0027s weird. It\u0027s like I learned after my brother\u0027s death experience, almost near, I wrote a poem to him. And I have it at home, but it\u0027s like I named it sick brother. And I said-- I don\u0027t remember exactly what I said in it, but I was writing letters to him when he was in the ICU unit, because I didn\u0027t want to go in there. I didn\u0027t want to go in there. And I told him when he was like laying there, and I told him I loved him. And I never told him that, but I had to tell him that. And I was like, man, in case something happens, I want him to know that even though he gets on my nerves, I do love my brother.",
        "No, I wrote it to him.",
        "He read it.",
        "No.",
        "Did you ever have any thoughts like oh, I want to die?",
        "Normal.",
        "Yeah, like whatever. One day I told him, \"Oh, I love you, brother.\" \"ooh, get away from me.\" He told me, \"Get away from me.\"",
        "That is true, very true.",
        "Is there any advice you would give to any young people out there who are trying to use their lives the same way you did, and they get up in the next incident like this?",
        "No, I don\u0027t got to-- have you ever imagined your death, like--"

        "That night there is a champagne party in my room for the entire ward. I let one of the nurses wear my bed cap, the one with mink along the brim. A few of us are busted for smoking in the bathroom. Drunk on Fools Wit long after the others have returned to their rooms, I prank phone call various former employers, leaving messages of hell-born prophecy on their voice mail. I make a list of hardships and collection agencies I will escape if I were to die. How soon is now?",
        "At night I dream I am a beekeeper developing a strain of worker bees that automatically die before their pension fund kicks in. Because the fund only amounts to a thimble full of pollen, the early death is useful. I wake with the image of me standing before a subcommittee selling a special gas made from identical molecular bee genetics that can be sprayed on postal employees. I hold a sign that reads, works until drops dead.",
        "Dr. Fargate tells me how lucky I am. He says surgery was touch and go, and that for an hour or so there I was this close-- with his fore and middle fingers side by side sticking out from the rest of his fist, he demonstrates the proximity. \"You nearly died,\" he says, smiling, teasing me, \"But it looks like you\u0027ll live.\" Oh? Why, that\u0027s wonderful. Life, one missed opportunity after the other, was this close.",
        "My roommate in the hospital tells me how lucky I am. She says that when she arrived there was no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom. \"How am I supposed to wipe myself without no toilet paper?\" she asked. Indeed. Great to be alive. Later I request a private room. But her line of thinking gets me asking questions of my own, big questions. The biggest questions come at meal time, such as, what is it?",
        "One evening the nurse comes in with my dinner tray. I situate myself upright in bed so as to feed myself, and lift the cover off the entree. They\u0027ve served me my own pancreas. What\u0027s more is they try to pass it off as Italian beef. I tell the nurse there\u0027s been a mistake. I think I may have somebody else\u0027s tray. \"No,\" she says, \"no mistake.\"",
        "So many questions. So many, many questions. Oh, the morphine drip provides five or six brilliant answers, but I can\u0027t remember them now.",
        "I blather away the hours in a semi-fog of hope that maybe the doctors missed something. Maybe I\u0027m not so lucky after all. Maybe they\u0027re wrong about me. Maybe I won\u0027t have to return to that world of tending bar, and waiting tables, and customers with their selfish tastes and relentless hungers for penny ante attention. No more train and bus connections.",
        "The flowers and get well cards will keep coming in all day long, the few days I\u0027ll have remaining. And friends will flock in from the trees or wherever it is they\u0027ve been hiding, and tell me over and over again how much they love me. They\u0027ll tell me not so much in words but in the way they massage my feet, get me ice cream, and bring me gifts. \"Not another book on the mind-body connection. Oh, put it with the stack of others there in the corner. Did you find out if Toshiro had any more of those little bed jackets for me?\"",
        "Dr. Fargate comes and goes with his probing brigade. I think the Pakistani has a crush on me. Anyway, he\u0027s barely an intern.",

It\u0027s critical.\" \"Oh, thank God. I thought you were going to talk about my bill.\" He tells me at this point I should do anything to lift my spirits."

        "Great, take it under me. That\u0027s great.",
        "Story follows Luke. He\u0027s accompanied by his college buddy Bill, and both are packed for a road trip across the country to San Francisco.",
        "Let\u0027s just kill the Blade Runner.",
        "Locations-- car interior, gas station exterior, HIV clinic parking lot, HIV clinic interior, highway. The music is Strauss\u0027 \"Four Last Songs,\" particularly \"Ruhe, meine Seele\" sung by Dame Janet Baker.",
        "OK, can you take it under me? Hold.",
        "Follows Luke and his friend Bill to the gas station and to the clinic.",
        "OK, take it out. Take out the Janet Baker.",
        "Bill loads one-hits of pot while driving on the way to the gas station into the clinic.",
        "Can we nix that Strauss music? It\u0027s kind of too mournful. There\u0027s really no music on the soundtrack. It\u0027s stark, crisp, maybe some songs coming from the radio at the clinic\u0027s desk. Great. And definitely from the car radio, mixed with surfing on an AM radio. No music.",
        "The drama is constantly being undermined through the cool, collective quality of Luke\u0027s demeanor. He seems detached. Quote, \"I\u0027m not sure how I feel. I feel a little sad, sort of mad. I guess blank, but I\u0027m OK.\" End quote.",
        "Title-- Road. Treatment-- it\u0027s shot entirely on video, mostly handheld, shaky, out of focus, bad color, overblown color actually.",
        "Luke thinks he\u0027s sounding like a short story assignment in a creative writing class, or worse, trapped inside an artsy novel. Luke imagines himself in a television dramatization of himself. Camera pulls back from behind Luke\u0027s head, sort of on a mini-crane. Camera floats, hovers over the back of Luke\u0027s head. The ceiling of the car must be incredibly high, he thinks to himself.",
        "Bill pulls into the closest parking spot in the clinic, blows out the last of the one-hit, and as he\u0027s knocking the brass pipe into the ashtray, turns to Luke with that slightly watery look in his eyes from too much intake. Luke takes it as one of those Care Bear looks that he\u0027s experienced before from Bill. There\u0027s a moment of anger flashing in Luke when he registers Bill\u0027s look. When Bill asks him, \"What are you thinking about?\" Luke responds, \"Who\u0027s thinking? Nothing.\" I hate thinking I\u0027m in a novel, he thinks to himself.",
        "Cut to interior of the clinic, the reception area. Can we change this sound bed here? Great. Take it down just it\u0027s a little-- great.",
        "The nurse assigned to Luke\u0027s anonymous number is a black drag queen named Stephanie who wears a full nurse\u0027s outfit complete with a little paper hat that sits atop of her freshly coiffed hairdo. She\u0027s the only one in the clinic who wears a real uniform. Stephanie has the longest fingernails that Luke has ever seen on anyone. Luke thinks briefly about how the fingernails keep on growing even after a person dies, but he pushes that thought away with his fingers to his forehead, wonders why he\u0027s thinking about that. It\u0027s that novel thing again.",
        "Stephanie, the drag queen nurse, walks Luke back to the small cubicles that the tests are administered in, and then used to relay the results. Luke\u0027s narrator imagines how many people have been in these cubicles and what they would look like if they were all piled on top of one another, piles of tested bodies.",
        "Cut to Stephanie closing the hollow core door. It makes that hollow core door sound. Do you have that on a cart? [DOOR CLOSES] Perfect. Maybe a shot from a security camera that shows all of the cubicles in the clinic.",
        "Luke imagines himself in a George Tooker painting that was reproduced in his sixth grade reader. He wonders what his sixth grade teacher would think of Stephanie. He wonders if his sixth grade teacher was ever tested. He imagines her body in the pileup of bodies who have come to the clinic.",
        "Stephanie\u0027s been saying something, and Luke has to blink his eyes again to refocus. He explains to Stephanie that he\u0027s been expecting this result, that he\u0027s experienced a large share of AIDS cared for and likewise buried lots of his friends, but it doesn\u0027t seem to come as a surprise. Stephanie says, \"You can cry or hold my hand. I just want you to sit for a moment and let it sink in.\" Luke thinks, whatever.",
        "Cut to Bill in waiting room, flipping through People\u0027s \"The Year in Pictures.\" Cut back to close-up of Luke, forehead wrinkled. He thinks his narrator wants him to get out of the cubicle. He waits for Stephanie to finish her spiel, thanks her, and shakes her hand, getting a slight scrape from one of the fingernails. Close-up on Luke\u0027s hand, new scratch. The walls seem to pulsate as Luke walks down the hallway to the reception area. He tries to be as blank as possible to Bill.",
        "I\u0027m not sure about this final section. I know that we talked about it ending on the highway with the car being surrounded by bikers on their way to the Sturgis bikers rally, but now I like the idea of it ending on the highway entrance ramp. OK.",
        "Can I get this microphone adjusted a little so I don\u0027t have to lean over so much?",
        "Cut to interior of car pulling out of parking lot. Luke keeps looking straight ahead as he murmurs, \"I\u0027m positive.\" Long slow pan from the back of Luke\u0027s head to the back of Bill\u0027s. There\u0027s no reaction in either of their faces, or better, the profiles of their faces. This is the longest shot. They don\u0027t look at each other.",
        "Perhaps this scene would be shot in blue screen with the camera in the backseat, and the sky surrounding the two heads of Bill and Luke having that old scratchy 16 millimeter time lapse exposure so the clouds seem to be moving at a rapid pace. Flickers, flips back and forth between real sky and blue screen backdrop. Voice comes up on a car radio, try not to think of the future. Just live in the present moment, something like that. You got that? It comes on to the radio.",
        "Luke comments to Bill, \"Live entirely in the present, huh?\" Bill drives and looks out the corner of his right eye to see what position Luke is holding his head in. Luke looks outside passenger window, and every once in a while turns to glance at Bill. Long pause. There\u0027s dead air.",
        "Cut to Luke\u0027s point of view. Car is pulling on to entrance ramp of highway. Luke sees hitchhiker with a sign that he scans for any remote meaning to the narrative. Luke sees himself outside of his own story. He can\u0027t read the hitchhiker\u0027s sign. He knows that he\u0027s on a long, silent journey. He leans over to turn off the radio. Cut to black.",
        "Check, one, two, three.",
        "Synopsis-- the story concerns Luke-- gay, white, Midwestern, late twenties-- follows Luke on the day that he is informed of his HIV-positive status. Luke cops a stance of cold, brittle, not unlike the Harrison Ford narration on Blade Runner, but there\u0027s a hint of vulnerability to Luke. Have we got the Harrison Ford or the Rutger Hauer voice?",
        "Great, roll it."

What are you looking at? Oh, you got something? What do you be about? And started asking them what their affiliation is, and other stuff. And we started talking [BLEEP] to them and other stuff. And they pulled out a gun, and they said OK, you want to talk [BLEEP] now? Let\u0027s talk [BLEEP]. And I panicked. I mean, nobody had ever pulled a gun on me. I was like, holy [BLEEP], and I just started kind of running around, and I was like, oh my god, they\u0027re going to kill us. They\u0027re actually going to kill us. It had finally sunk in that somebody was going to kill us, that that would be it, the end of my life. At like 14, somebody was going to kill me.",

So everybody just kind of spread out, and I ran, and I lost my shoes, and my jacket, my purse. I lost everything. I was just like throwing things off me to make me lighter so I could run faster. And finally I jumped into a dumpster, and I stood there. And I must have stood there a good hour, hour and a half. And I just stood there and prayed and shaked, and tried to not make noise. And I heard them run past me, and run past me, and screaming \"bitch\" and looking for people. And I was there, and I was praying to God that they didn\u0027t open the dumpster and find me, because if they would have, I think I would have been dead.",

And they pulled out a gun, and they said OK, you want to talk [BLEEP] now? Let\u0027s talk [BLEEP]. And I panicked. I mean, nobody had ever pulled a gun on me. I was like, holy [BLEEP], and I just started kind of running around, and I was like, oh my god, they\u0027re going to kill us. They\u0027re actually going to kill us. It had finally sunk in that somebody was going to kill us, that that would be it, the end of my life. At like 14, somebody was going to kill me."

And I heard them run past me, and run past me, and screaming \"bitch\" and looking for people.

            "Act One. So what if you knew? What if you really knew the date and time of your own death? Well, Kevin Kelly spent most of his twenties wandering around Asia. He was a freelance photographer. And he found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies. He found himself drawn to religious ceremonies. He was confused about what he believed.",
            "So he bicycled across the country, and as he did he found himself increasingly obsessed with death, with dying. He was making drawings and writing haikus along the way, and as he went across the country, they became more and more dark, more and more preoccupied with death. And as he traveled across the country, the other thing is that he always had to find a place to stay every night. And at first he just tried what he had done in Jerusalem. That is, he would just find a church, and he would camp out on the church lawn. But people got upset at that.",
            "And so what he decided to do instead is that at each town that he would come into, he would find some quiet residential street. And he\u0027d go up to a house, and he\u0027d say hi, this is who I am. I\u0027m bicycling across the country. I\u0027ve just eaten dinner, he would say so they wouldn\u0027t feel obligated to feed him. Can I camp out in back? And invariably they would say yes, and invariably they would also at some point invite him in for coffee.",
            "But all that changed. When he was 27, he came into Jerusalem. It was the weekend of both Easter and Passover, and the city was flooded with tourists.",
            "Nearly two decades after that happened, Kevin Kelly is now the executive editor of a magazine about the future, Wired magazine.",
            "Coming up, more people who nearly died and what they made of it, in a minute when our program continues.",
            "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and performers and documentary producers to tackle that theme. Today\u0027s program, Should Have Been Dead, stories of people who thought they were going to die and what they learned or did not learn from the experience."

            "Having that realization that I believe that Jesus Christ had actually risen from those tombs did not settle 1,001 other things about what one was supposed to do with that, what I was supposed to do with that. Did that mean I was supposed to be a monk? Did that mean I was supposed to be an evangelist? Did that mean that I had to immediately renounce all that I had and get into sackcloth and ashes and march out into the desert? All of that was left unopened, and that is in fact what occupied my mind as I went back to my hostel to lay down and think about, because I had no clue what it really meant to me ultimately.",
            "And that\u0027s what I was pondering when I sort of was laying there napping. And I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a voice, but there was an idea that came into my mind that just would not go away. And that was that I should live as if I would die in six months, that I should really truly live. And that I could not tell for certain whether I would really die, but that either way I should live as if I was going to die. And so that was the assignment.",
            "I\u0027m a pretty rational person. I\u0027m pretty logical. And after thinking the thought that I should live as if I was going to die in six months, the first thought that comes to my head was, well that\u0027s pretty silly. You have no evidence whatsoever. I could live like I\u0027m going to die in six months and not die at all. It would just be kind of an interesting exercise. But at the same time, it was equally probable that I might die in six months. It happened all the time. There was no guarantee that I wouldn\u0027t die. And so fairly quickly I decided that I could not settle that issue of whether I would really die or not, or just think that I was going to die in six months. And that in either case, the important thing was to live as if I really believed that I was going to die in six months. Which is what I set out to do.",
            "The next couple days had a kind of joyous experience of saying, OK, what do I do for six months if I have only six months to live? And the answers to that surprised me as much as the assignment. Because after thinking that through and contemplating it, the conclusion that I came to was that what I wanted to do for six months was to go home and be ordinary, to go back to my parents, to help them take out the trash and trim the hedges and move furniture around, and to be with them.",
            "And I was really shocked by that, because I thought that with six months to live I would climb Mount Everest, or I would go scuba diving to the depths of the ocean, or get in a speedboat and see how fast I could go. But instead I wanted to go back home and be with my family for that time.",
            "I, of course, did not tell anybody my crazy idea. This is, in fact, the first time I\u0027m really talking about it publicly, because it was a very scary and sort of alarming idea, and I never told anybody why I was coming home.",
            "I got back to where my parents live in New Jersey, and things were unbelievably ordinary. And yet I found myself relishing the ordinariness and finding it in some ways as exotic as anything that I had traveled to see. And so I was involved in-- I helped around the house. I dug up shrubs. I worked on a deck. I moved furniture, washed dishes, and I was intending to kind of spend my last remaining six months at home getting to know my parents better, and myself hopefully.",
            "But about three months into that, my travel urges I guess got the better of me. And what I was most concerned about is I wanted to see my brothers and sisters. I had four brothers and sisters, and they were scattered all across the country. And so I felt very strongly that I wanted to see them before I died. And I got the idea that the way to see them was to ride my bicycle across the country and visit them on bicycle.",
            "But before I did that, I made up a will to dispose of the little things that I had. And I had some money left over, and one of the things that I did with that money was I went to the bank and got some cashier\u0027s checks for like $500 and $1,000. And I mailed the money to various people anonymously as gifts. And I think giving away those thousands of dollars was the first true act of charity I had ever done, because there was absolutely no way for any kind of gratitude or elevated feelings to come back to me, because people had no idea who had sent them that money.",
            "It was really remarkable to see the consequences of getting an anonymous gift like that, because when you get a check for $1,000 in the mail, you immediately become suspicious of all your friends of having given it to you. And so there\u0027s this sort of like the suspicion of charity, suspicion of goodness, that starts to infect the people that are around you. And you look at someone, you think, hmm, I wonder if he gave me that $1,000?",
            "I would get twisted and caught up, and these things were sort of in the background consuming me. Actually I found that I could think about little else for many, many months, that behind all that I was doing there was always this unresolved question of was God real? If he was real, then how could we ignore him? And if we were trying to not ignore him, what do we do? And if he was real, then what about these other things that people said about God?",
            "I had enough money left over to basically pay for food and whatnot on my bicycle journey across America. And the path that I had to visit all my brothers and sisters was not a direct route of going from San Francisco to New York. I actually had to go up to Idaho and back down to Texas, and then back up through Indiana. So it was a 5,000 mile trip.",
            "The day, which coincidentally was exactly six months from when I had this assignment, was October 31, was Halloween. And so the plan would be that I would ride back home so that I would come back to die on the day after Halloween.",
            "I think there are a lot of people who have trouble staying in the present. There are some people who like to slip into the past as a means to perhaps fantasize or escape, and they find that the past is the place that they retreat to. And I often retreat to the future. I was not a person who planned or had a career staged out, or who had a particular woman he wanted to marry someday, or some vision of a house. The future that I found so hard to give up was a much more insidious type. It was that of-- I like to buy this record because in the future I want to hear the song again and again. Or I will read this book, and there\u0027s some cool ideas in it because someday I may write an article about this, and it\u0027s kind of good to know that.",
            "There was a sense in which my entire life was shifted to the future, and the thought of sort of doing something now for the enjoyment or the pleasures or the principle of the function of just right now, without any sense at all that it would ever be used again or that it could ever be brought forward, was extremely difficult and disconcerting. And I fought it day by day, and tooth by tooth.",
            "One of the ways I dealt with this was that I was actually able by the last weeks to not think about my life beyond Halloween. There was a way in which I had just-- each time a thought came up about something that was beyond this horizon, I just said, nope, can\u0027t think about, it doesn\u0027t work. We have to dwell in the present. And at the same time I was doing that-- and I was able to do that-- I also decided that it was entirely unnatural and inhumane way to live, and that having a future is part of what being human is about, and that when you take away the future for humans, you take away a lot of their humanness. And that it\u0027s not actually a very good thing to live entirely in the present, that one needs to have a past, and one needs to have a future to be fully human.",
            "So I would spend my evenings with entirely ordinary people, and my job at that point was to tell them my story. It was to tell them how great a time I was having, because if I wasn\u0027t having a great time they were really disappointed, because I was riding for them. I was vicariously doing what they had always wanted their lives to do, and so the more I enjoyed my time, and the more in the present I was living, the more they enjoyed it, and the more it uplifted them. And so that was basically my job.",
            "It was a journey that began at the tomb of Jesus, and as I set off to my own presumed death, I did indeed think about Jesus Christ. We have the history in the Gospels of Jesus\u0027 torment in his soul as he approached what he knew of his anointed time to die. So it was again that very harsh information of knowing when you\u0027re going to die. And Jesus\u0027 soul was in great turmoil and pain because of knowing that. And I think I did experience some of that, not because I had the same weight. That was just my own life. But Jesus prayed that this burden be lifted, and there were days when I did pray that, that if I didn\u0027t have to die, I really would rather not.",
            "By late fall I was pedaling through the Appalachians, and it was getting colder and colder, and my hands were freezing on the bicycles, and there was ice on my tents in the morning when I got up. And as each day went on, I was coming closer and closer to terrain that I was familiar with and that felt like home. And I was riding into New Jersey, and I was elated. I was elated that I had accomplished this long journey, and I was elated that I was home to see my parents.",
            "And I came into their house on Halloween day, and I was so filled with ideas and things and emotions that I didn\u0027t really say very much. And again, I couldn\u0027t say very much. I think we had a wonderful dinner. They were, of course, glad to see me, because they hadn\u0027t seen me in a long time. They knew I was coming back, and we had a wonderful dinner. We had baskets of candy which I gave out to the kids.",
            "And we had a discussion that night which was about nothing in particular. It was not about the future. It was just about I think talking about our family, and my brothers and sisters, and I was telling them all that I had learned about them. And so it was a very together and, again, not a very dramatic evening, but just a pleasant one, the kind of one that you might have a memory about as you were dying. It was not a special evening, but just an ordinary evening.",
            "And I went to bed that night, which was a very difficult thing to do, because I was fully prepared at that point never to wake up again. I had been praying. I had gotten everything arranged. And at that point I\u0027d fully gone through in my own mind, my own soul, all the things that I might have regretted, and I had righted as many of those as I thought I could through letters. And I was prepared as much as anybody could be prepared to die.",
            "So I went to bed while the kids were still ringing the doorbells. And I went to sleep, because I was very tired after that long trip. And I didn\u0027t know what was going to happen the next day. I thought that I had done all that I could.",
            "And the next morning I woke up. And the next morning I woke up, and it was if-- the next morning I woke up, and it was if I had my entire life again. The next morning I woke up, and I had my entire life again. I had my future again. There was nothing special about the day. It was another ordinary day. I was reborn into ordinariness, but what more could one ask for?",
            "So I entered Jerusalem on Easter with the simple expectation that I was going to photograph yet another religious ceremony, another religious festival. And then for various reasons I got locked out of my hostel room. They had a curfew, and I didn\u0027t make it back in time. And I was in quite a fix because I was a stranger in this very strange town. When it happened, I didn\u0027t have enough money to stay elsewhere, nor did I even have knowledge of where to go.",
            "So I wandered the old town of Jerusalem at night, which had been shuttered up and was like a time machine. It was if I had been transported back into the 15th century, because all the souvenir vendors were gone, and what was left were the labyrinthine paths of cobbled passageways. And I wandered around for a number of hours, and it was getting colder. Eventually I found myself at the one place that was still open, which was some of the churches. And particularly I finally settled into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is called and viewed as the church built over the mound where Jesus Christ was crucified.",
            "And I was getting very tired, and there weren\u0027t many people around. And so eventually I laid myself out on about the only flat area that was left, which was this marble slab underneath some pendants that had incense on them. And this was presumably the slab that commemorated the exact position of the crosses. So I slept there. I slept on the crucifixion spot that night because it was the only place. There was no place in the inn.",
            "I slept there until early morning, when the activities started to increase, and people started coming in. And I went out and followed the crowd where it was going when they were going out to the tombs area in Jerusalem. And I went out, and there were some folding chairs set up in front of this tomb area. And as the sun was coming up on that Easter morning, I was staring at empty tombs.",
            "And for a reason that I cannot comprehend, as I sat on that chair contemplating this view of the early sun morning coming into the empty tombs, all that I had been wrestling with for the past many, many years in thinking about religion sort of became resolved in my mind. And at that very moment, I believed that Jesus Christ has indeed risen from those tombs.",
            "In an instant the tension of trying to figure things out was resolved, because now suddenly everything was figured out. It was as if you had been working on a problem for a long time, and suddenly the answer was there, and it was very clear that was the answer. And although there were many things that were still not clear to you, you were very certain that you were on the right path."

Did that mean I was supposed to be a monk? Did that mean I was supposed to be an evangelist? Did that mean that I had to immediately renounce all that I had and get into sackcloth and ashes and march out into the desert? All of that was left unopened, and that is in fact what occupied my mind as I went back to my hostel to lay down and think about, because I had no clue what it really meant to me ultimately."

And I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a voice, but there was an idea that came into my mind that just would not go away. And that was that I should live as if I would die in six months, that I should really truly live. And that I could not tell for certain whether I would really die, but that either way I should live as if I was going to die. And so that was the assignment."

And after thinking the thought that I should live as if I was going to die in six months, the first thought that comes to my head was, well that\u0027s pretty silly. You have no evidence whatsoever. I could live like I\u0027m going to die in six months and not die at all. It would just be kind of an interesting exercise. But at the same time, it was equally probable that I might die in six months. It happened all the time. There was no guarantee that I wouldn\u0027t die. And so fairly quickly I decided that I could not settle that issue of whether I would really die or not, or just think that I was going to die in six months. And that in either case, the important thing was to live as if I really believed that I was going to die in six months. Which is what I set out to do."

And the answers to that surprised me as much as the assignment. Because after thinking that through and contemplating it, the conclusion that I came to was that what I wanted to do for six months was to go home and be ordinary, to go back to my parents, to help them take out the trash and trim the hedges and move furniture around, and to be with them."

            "That is so stupid. Let go of me.",

            "Well, it was April 2 or April 6 of \u002796, and he had come to the house in the morning. And he had bought some gym shoes, and he was showing off, ha ha, look, I got some gym shoes. And you\u0027re not supposed to buy gym shoes because that\u0027s not fair, because you\u0027re not buying stuff for my little brother. And I was like, you\u0027re being greedy. Something\u0027s going to happen to you for being greedy.",
            "And I remember that I felt weird that day. You know how they say women have this kind of sense? I don\u0027t know, but I felt weird.",
            "One of his friends, they were going to go party at a bar, and they went towards the back of the gangway. They were over there in the back of the gangway, and--",
            "A house. Of a house.",
            "Yeah. And they were just all talking there, and the guy stuck out the gun to my brother, and my brother tried to take it from his hand.",
            "No, they were all just over there in the back of the gangway. They were talking, and he tried to rob my brother. And my brother tried to take the gun from him, and the guy did it. While my brother was trying to run, he shot him in the stomach, which hit his spinal cord.",
            "When he was in the ICU unit, he looked real bad. And he was like all bloody, and blood was coming out, whatever. And he\u0027s dark-skinned, my brother. And at the ICU he looked pale. He had no color. And my mom was crying, because she\u0027s like, \"Oh, my son. He\u0027s Negrito, like he\u0027s dark-skinned. Where\u0027s his color at? Where\u0027s his color?\" And she was crying, \"Where\u0027s my son\u0027s color at?\" And begging, \"Oh, my son\u0027s not dark no more. Got to give him his color back, because we will know that he\u0027s healthy with his color back.\"",
            "What was your reaction to that? How did it make you feel?",
            "He usually talks about it freely, nice. But I guess because it\u0027s me he won\u0027t talk about it normally, because me and him, we never talk about it. I want him to tell me, because I never asked him that before. And I wanted him to tell me something that I always wanted to know, and I was mad, because he gave me a dumb answer. I thought, then tell me something more--",
            "Yeah, and he didn\u0027t tell me that. He just made me feel like, oh, my god, you\u0027re never going to change, or something.",
            "What have you learned from this experience?",
            "Shut up. No wonder your friends can\u0027t listen to this.",
            "Do you appreciate life more now?",
            "He\u0027s changed, yeah. He doesn\u0027t drink anymore. He thinks more about the future, like before he would go day by day.",
            "Not at all, and you could drink when you\u0027re paralyzed. You could. He says he doesn\u0027t smoke.",
            "He don\u0027t want to. He says that he feels stupid. He looks at-- before, he used to go out with his boys and all his friends. He\u0027s never seen how stupid they look. And now that he doesn\u0027t drink, he sees how stupid they are, and that there\u0027s no point to drink and get like that anymore. He says that-- one day he told me that if he ever walked again, he wouldn\u0027t take it for granted. He told me that once. He goes, I\u0027ll kiss the ground, or something like that. He told me once.",
            "And I was like, whoa, because we never talk like nice to each other. We\u0027re always fighting or something about something. And that one day that he told me that, I was like, oh. I felt weird. When he talks nice to me, it feels weird. Like when I was doing the interview, I couldn\u0027t look at him, because I was like, oh, you get on my nerves. It\u0027s that kind of thing, like we love each other, but we can\u0027t stand each other. And when we fight, he still beats me up, even though he\u0027s in a wheelchair. He still beats me up. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s strange.",
            "People tell me, how can he beat you up still? And I\u0027m like, he does.",
            "I don\u0027t know. He does. I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s just real-- it\u0027s weird. It\u0027s like I learned after my brother\u0027s death experience, almost near, I wrote a poem to him. And I have it at home, but it\u0027s like I named it sick brother. And I said-- I don\u0027t remember exactly what I said in it, but I was writing letters to him when he was in the ICU unit, because I didn\u0027t want to go in there. I didn\u0027t want to go in there. And I told him when he was like laying there, and I told him I loved him. And I never told him that, but I had to tell him that. And I was like, man, in case something happens, I want him to know that even though he gets on my nerves, I do love my brother.",
            "No, I wrote it to him.",
            "He read it.",
            "No.",
            "Did you ever have any thoughts like oh, I want to die?",
            "Normal.",
            "Yeah, like whatever. One day I told him, \"Oh, I love you, brother.\" \"ooh, get away from me.\" He told me, \"Get away from me.\"",

            "That night there is a champagne party in my room for the entire ward. I let one of the nurses wear my bed cap, the one with mink along the brim. A few of us are busted for smoking in the bathroom. Drunk on Fools Wit long after the others have returned to their rooms, I prank phone call various former employers, leaving messages of hell-born prophecy on their voice mail. I make a list of hardships and collection agencies I will escape if I were to die. How soon is now?",
            "At night I dream I am a beekeeper developing a strain of worker bees that automatically die before their pension fund kicks in. Because the fund only amounts to a thimble full of pollen, the early death is useful. I wake with the image of me standing before a subcommittee selling a special gas made from identical molecular bee genetics that can be sprayed on postal employees. I hold a sign that reads, works until drops dead.",
            "Dr. Fargate tells me how lucky I am. He says surgery was touch and go, and that for an hour or so there I was this close-- with his fore and middle fingers side by side sticking out from the rest of his fist, he demonstrates the proximity. \"You nearly died,\" he says, smiling, teasing me, \"But it looks like you\u0027ll live.\" Oh? Why, that\u0027s wonderful. Life, one missed opportunity after the other, was this close.",
            "My roommate in the hospital tells me how lucky I am. She says that when she arrived there was no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom. \"How am I supposed to wipe myself without no toilet paper?\" she asked. Indeed. Great to be alive. Later I request a private room. But her line of thinking gets me asking questions of my own, big questions. The biggest questions come at meal time, such as, what is it?",
            "One evening the nurse comes in with my dinner tray. I situate myself upright in bed so as to feed myself, and lift the cover off the entree. They\u0027ve served me my own pancreas. What\u0027s more is they try to pass it off as Italian beef. I tell the nurse there\u0027s been a mistake. I think I may have somebody else\u0027s tray. \"No,\" she says, \"no mistake.\"",
            "So many questions. So many, many questions. Oh, the morphine drip provides five or six brilliant answers, but I can\u0027t remember them now.",
            "I blather away the hours in a semi-fog of hope that maybe the doctors missed something. Maybe I\u0027m not so lucky after all. Maybe they\u0027re wrong about me. Maybe I won\u0027t have to return to that world of tending bar, and waiting tables, and customers with their selfish tastes and relentless hungers for penny ante attention. No more train and bus connections.",
            "The flowers and get well cards will keep coming in all day long, the few days I\u0027ll have remaining. And friends will flock in from the trees or wherever it is they\u0027ve been hiding, and tell me over and over again how much they love me. They\u0027ll tell me not so much in words but in the way they massage my feet, get me ice cream, and bring me gifts. \"Not another book on the mind-body connection. Oh, put it with the stack of others there in the corner. Did you find out if Toshiro had any more of those little bed jackets for me?\"",
            "Dr. Fargate comes and goes with his probing brigade. I think the Pakistani has a crush on me. Anyway, he\u0027s barely an intern.",
            "Later Dr. Fargate returns alone with something serious to tell me. \"We\u0027ve taken a second look at your biopsy report. I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re looking at stage four. It\u0027s critical.\" \"Oh, thank God. I thought you were going to talk about my bill.\" He tells me at this point I should do anything to lift my spirits."
