        "I soon found out that the band has befriended Scott Lee and that they\u0027ve sort of informally appointed him their de-facto archivist. Singer Kim Warnick corresponds with Scott via email, sometimes, like four times a day. Guitarist and songwriter, Kurt Bloch, graciously calls him \"A good person to have on our team.\" Though, when he first saw Scott Lee\u0027s packet, he had some understandable worries.",
        "If anything, the Fastbacks are a little protective of Scott Lee. When I was talking to Kurt, I jokingly called Scott his stalker. But he set me straight.",
        "Oh, a super-fan?",
        "Like the super-fan, the members of the Fastbacks all have day jobs. So, on any given day, it\u0027s possible that Scott is devoting more energy to being a fan than the Fastbacks devote to being in the band. When I interviewed Kim, the gaping differences between being a band member and being a super-fan were never clearer.",
        "OK, so I have a pop-quiz for you.",
        "Sometimes, opening your mail can be a little like listening to the radio. You\u0027re not paying attention, just absent-mindedly flipping through the letters and bills, and then, wham, some little surprise comes out of nowhere and changes your day.",
        "How many total songs, before the new album, New Mansions in Sound, have the Fastbacks recorded?",
        "How many total songs have the Fastbacks recorded?",
        "Really? OK. I have to say it is 127. And I was wondering also if you knew the median song length?",
        "Well, let\u0027s start with an easier one. What do you think is the average length of a Fastbacks song?",
        "I got this package. Inside was a letter, thanking me for mentioning the Fastbacks in a book review I had written, not from one of the Fastbacks themselves, mind you, just some guy in Chicago. His name was Scott Lee, and he\u0027d enclosed this xerox booklet about the band.",
        "When do you think you made the switch between just being a listener and being, as Kurt Bloch called you today, a super-fan?",
        "When you show this info packet to people, what is usually their reaction?",
        "In fact, Scott\u0027s spare time is limited. He holds down a full-time job at a Chicago advertising agency, and he writes his own songs. And, truthfully, he flirts with the idea of not staying a fan. He\u0027s moving to Seattle, partly to be closer to the Fastbacks. He\u0027s actually in their circle of friends now. And he\u0027s tried a couple of times to start his own band.",
        "Once, he was invited on-stage with Kurt to play along with the song. It was exciting. But he\u0027s left-handed. And they didn\u0027t have a left-handed guitar for him. So it was sort of a disaster, not the moment a super-fan dreams of.",
        "So, in this show, what happens is someone tells their little story and then we play a song. So you get to pick which Fastbacks song gets to play at the end of your story.",
        "Flipping through it, I stopped cold at something called, \"The Fastback\u0027s Drummers Pie Chart\". Since they formed in 1979, the Fastbacks have gone through about a dozen drummers. And this pie chart identifies the drummers by name, listing the percentage of songs which each one has contributed to. But, at the bottom of the page, small print warns, \"Note, Rusty and Nate\u0027s shares may not be totally accurate. Their percentages may be approximately 0.68% off.\" And I don\u0027t think a decimal point had ever struck me as endearing before. The drastic exactitude of 0.68% sort of captured my heart, and I had to meet this person.",
        "So he showed me other stats, like total recorded versions of songs, total number of seconds of songs, which is 30,343, in case you were wondering.",
        "I was stunned. I mean, I thought I liked the band. And, normally, as a music lover and as a woman, I rail against the mostly-male, record-collector geek habit of reducing rock and roll to baseball card collecting. They flatten out this complex, thrilling thing down to manageable lists of names and titles and dates.",
        "But Scott Lee\u0027s Fastbacks tribute has the devotional fervour of a medieval illuminated manuscript. The list of facts and figures is so relentless and exact and painstaking that it takes on this liturgical glow, as if the Fastbacks were a religion and Scott Lee its prophet."

        "That\u0027s pretty much the truth. My brother has had a jones for singing for just about as long as he\u0027s been alive. All he ever wanted to do is make music, to sing for people.",
        "My brother and I go to a gig outside Boston where some company\u0027s holding its employee appreciation party.",
        "It\u0027s in a function room next to a hotel restaurant, Bumbershoot\u0027s, Rockingham\u0027s, or something like that.",
        "The night before this, my brother told me, he\u0027d performed at a Chinese restaurant. And after his finale, the whole place, all the guests and the waiters, even the stagehands, they all stood up and gave him a standing ovation. He said it was like being in a movie.",
        "A few months after I interviewed him, my brother got laid off from his computer job. My parents told me they were pretty worried about him. Now he\u0027s playing the stock market, trying to parlay his retirement money into a nest egg that will carry him for a while until he makes it big with his Tom Jones act.",
        "While my brother performed, I circulated through the room talking to people.",
        "He\u0027s pretty close?",
        "I didn\u0027t tell anyone that Alex Jones was my brother. I just asked them what they thought of him.",
        "I wanted to hear that he was making them happy. I wanted him to succeed. I wanted to help him get more work. I wanted to hear that they loved him.",
        "My brother sang constantly in our house when we were growing up. He always wanted to be a rock star or the next great soul singer. Once he was out on his own, he sang everywhere he could. And he still does, anywhere he can find an audience to appreciate him.",
        "[MUSIC PLAYING - \"FALL IN LOVE\" ALEX JONES SINGING TOM JONES]",
        "My brother\u0027s been in countless rock, blues, and R\u0026B bands over the years. But, these days, he\u0027s mostly hired as a Tom Jones impersonator. He does that by night, though. During the day, he holds down a straight job.",
        "My brother performs with a revue called The Hall of Fame Superstars. There\u0027s a Patsy Cline, an Elton John, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison. And then my brother closes the show as Tom Jones.",
        "My brother is nothing, if not confident, at least on the surface. He thinks positive and has an uncanny, almost, overconfidence. It\u0027s an amazing quality, really, even unsettling.",
        "My brother\u0027s 43, not married, doesn\u0027t have kids. He\u0027s had a lot of girlfriends, but he doesn\u0027t have a steady one now. These days, he\u0027s living at home with my parents in Massachusetts.",
        "Why don\u0027t we go to the music room?",
        "--for a little bit to get out of the way.",
        "Now it looks a whole lot different.",
        "Right. Right in the corner here.",
        "Rek-O-Kut.",
        "This is a tape of my brother pretending to be a star, recorded on my family\u0027s old Grundig tape recorder back around 1966. My parents put a lot of insulation in the walls of the music room, so my brother could really scream.",
        "This is the room where my brother began studying the great rhythm and blues singers, people like Al Green, Little Richard, Otis Redding, James Brown, and Tom Jones, who my brother thinks brings them all together.",
        "That\u0027s not Tom Jones. It\u0027s my brother, Alex Jones. And that\u0027s not his real name. His real name is Mark Gediman.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "I remember the first time I ever saw my brother perform. My parents took me to see him at a high school variety show when I was still in elementary school.",
        "I remember, by the end of the number, your shirt was virtually half off or something. That was my recollection. I was very impressed. I\u0027m sure it was the first time I ever saw you perform.",
        "Oh, I was absolutely there.",
        "Yeah, absolutely there. And I remember that very well. And mostly, of course, I remember you.",
        "I have a vivid memory of being on the playground behind my elementary school, trying to explain to the other kids that, the night before, my brother was this big star. And I imitated you, singing the same song, which, of course, I had heard endlessly with you rehearsing it.",
        "And I still know the song. And I went out and bought the record, by the way, about five years ago. And I have it. And the only reason I know that album is because of you.",
        "But, I remember, I was imitating you complete with undoing my shirt. I felt like a celebrity, even though the other kids didn\u0027t know it, because, god, my brother, he just did this thing. And so I was pretty impressed.",
        "My brother\u0027s middle name is Alex. He bumped it up to the front.",
        "My brother left music completely for many years after this time, around 1984. For a while he dabbled with a little home recording setup trying to write some songs, but his heart wasn\u0027t in it. He stopped going out to clubs, lost touch with most of his musician friends, didn\u0027t play, didn\u0027t perform, just left. Then, in 1991, seven years later, he discovered karaoke.",
        "After that, he was hooked.",
        "People loved him. He\u0027d steal the show, knocking out the audience at bars all over the Boston area. And he began winning contests.",
        "[APPLAUSE]",
        "For a while, when he was in this rock band in the late \u002770s, he called himself Alex Space. But that\u0027s another story. For the past five years it\u0027s been Jones, Alex Jones.",
        "My brother had found his way back to music. But, this time, he was Tom Jones.",
        "So where are you at in your process here?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So now you\u0027re going to stuff this down the front of your leather pants?",
        "And this is for the?",
        "OK. Can I follow you?",
        "OK.",
        "I see, OK.",
        "When he was done, my brother was transformed. Not exactly Tom Jones, but close enough and ready to go."

        "--the Jerry Lewis Telethon. I\u0027ve done schools. I\u0027ve done colleges. I\u0027ve done arts exhibition and whatever-- they also have cows and things like that, you know, one of those-- and, basically, anybody that\u0027ll have me, you know? Yeah, Tom gets around.",
        "[LAUGHTER]",
        "You know, it\u0027s tough to tell people, your co-workers, I\u0027m going to be Tom Jones, particularly when I\u0027ve been trying for the last few years to develop an image of this-- I\u0027ve been working as a computer analyst-- and developing this image as this kind of conservative nerd-type. And I\u0027ve totally, totally blown it.",
        "[SINGING - \"FALL IN LOVE\" AS TOM JONES]",
        "Singing as Tom Jones is very similar to the way that I naturally sing. We have a lot in common. But I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I\u0027m hitting notes and doing things that are beyond the scope of what he did.",
        "All right.",
        "There was a Scott amplifier.",
        "Yeah, and in the corner here was a very large, professional turntable, which had come right from a radio station. And I forget what the brand of that one was.",
        "Rek-O-Kut, yeah. But it was a top-of-the-line.",
        "But, yeah, this was a great room, great atmosphere. And you walked in this room and there were little musical notes bouncing all around it. And it was a place where we could just go in and play around and make believe you\u0027re the star.",
        "[SINGING] Come on, baby. Oh, let\u0027s loop-a-loo. She\u0027s a ha-hum, baby. Nothin\u0027 she can do. She\u0027s my little baby. Little Latin Lupe Loo.",
        "The entertainers who really are memorable and who\u0027ve stand the test of time, a great deal of them have tremendous screams. So I\u0027ve always thought that screaming was essential to someone who-- not necessarily in the popular music idiom. But, in anything that had any kind of edge or soul to it, there\u0027s got to be a scream there, somewhere. And the whole reason is the same reason. It\u0027s a expression of the most inner, primal feelings.",
        "Wow! Hey! Oh!",
        "Just at the beginning of What\u0027s New Pussycat, he goes, \"What\u0027s!\"",
        "See? Now, you\u0027re getting, now, right there with the what;s, you\u0027ve got James Brown, \"Wow!\" You know?",
        "And then you got Wilson Pickett, \"Ah-Ow!\" And then you got Ray Charles, \"Mm, Oh!\" You know? And then you\u0027ve got like, \"Yeah!\" Then you get, \"Uh!\" and, \"Ah!\" and, \"Hey! Hoy! Ah! Ah-oh! Ew-oh! Oh! Mm! Mm! What\u0027s!\" See? So that\u0027s there, you know?",
        "Now, nobody knew that I could sing. But there was a band, the Blood, Sweat \u0026 Tears, and the first version of them with Al Cooper. And there was a song on there called, \"I Love You More Than You\u0027ll Ever Know\", which is a real bluesy ballad. And I used to sing that over, and over, and over again in this music room. And so I ended up singing it.",
        "It was my first real performance, as me, in front of a stage, being the performer, like the Elvis or something. And I can remember having this silky shirt on. And I probably had my ID bracelet hanging. And I opened up my collar a little. And it was quite an experience, as I recall. And I think I did fairly well. I still do. I really sold it out, you know? I really started screaming there at the end.",
        "I don\u0027t even remember that you were there.",
        "You know, my real last name is Gediman, G- E- D, as in David, I- M- A- N. You know, I\u0027m proud of the name. But, as far as show biz is concerned, it can\u0027t be spelled.",
        "Yeah?",
        "They proceeded to tell us that they were going to put something like a half a million dollars behind The Super Group. And we were going to be the next Beatles or Monkeys. And I think, at the time, I was 21, I believe. And I\u0027m just sitting there going, \"Wow. I made the big-time.\"",
        "And he actually said to me that, \"I think you\u0027re the next Bruce Springsteen.\" He, at the time, was an A\u0026R representative for Atlantic Records.",
        "Joining this band called, Easy Action.",
        "They said, \"Listen, we want 50% of you.\" And I said, \"Forget it.\" I started a band right after that called Alex Space and the Orbits.",
        "\"We\u0027re going to take you to the top.\"",
        "I moved to another band now, called Flyer.",
        "And we had a band called Future City.",
        "That band was called Zippers Polite and the Ambassadors of Love.",
        "It came to the point where every record company thought that the other record company was going to sign me. And, in effect, that I was going to be the next big thing. There were articles written saying that I was going to be the next Kiss, and this, and that. And Warner Brothers, they were going to have cartoons. And even where they were talking about designing some sort of video pinball game, a real total marketing thing.",
        "And I was so excited. And we were a couple of weeks away from signing the contract when OPEC had a oil embargo in 1979. The price of plastic went up 400%. And that was the end of my shot right there. It just vanished before my eyes.",
        "We ended up getting them to sign us up for a booking contract. And then, one night, they came up to us. And neither of these guys drank. They had ulcers. And they both walked around drinking a glass of milk. I remember, one day, they both walked up to me with a glass of milk, and they said, \"Would you mind wearing an Elvis mask?\"",
        "To make a long story short, the thing really kind of fell apart. And, at this point, I really got just totally discouraged with the whole scene. And, in fact, I remember just feeling like that what I really had inside me wasn\u0027t coming out. And I took this microphone-- I still have it to this day-- and I threw it up against the wall. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s all smashed in. I just left and never went back. I left everything I had that was related to music in that room, and just, basically, quit.",
        "But I like Alex. Alexes work. There aren\u0027t too many Alexes that are big these days, so I\u0027m sticking with that name. It\u0027s very catchy because people always remember Alex.",
        "I was sitting having dinner. And I heard this music in the lounge. And this chorus of women singing was beautiful. I said, \"I have to go in and hear this group.\" And I went in there, and there\u0027s no group. There\u0027s a guy who looks like he\u0027s sitting behind a keyboard. And he\u0027s got this big thing saying, \"You are the star. \"Sing the hits\", or something like that.",
        "And I\u0027m looking up. And there\u0027s a video playing of follow the bouncing ball. I didn\u0027t know anything about karaoke. And it just sounds fantastic. And I\u0027m saying, \"Jeez, all these years I\u0027ve been sitting around trying to wait for the drummer to show up, or the bass player\u0027s having a nervous breakdown. And here there\u0027s no band, they just have these laser disks. They play the music and you just go up and sing. Not only that, you don\u0027t even have to remember the words because they\u0027re showing you the words. They had a little monitor that faces up to you. I mean, this was a singer\u0027s delight. It was heaven.",
        "At the height of my interest in karaoke, easily, I was going out all seven nights.",
        "I feel authentic. I feel real. This is real.",
        "I like to put the leather pants on because it just feels good. But I forgot one thing. I\u0027ve got to put something in my pouch. The ladies love this. You\u0027ve got to roll it up so it\u0027s just about that thick, and then you fold it over, OK?",
        "And what you got there is a real peach.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I had a jones for singing. I had an addiction.",
        "Authenticity\u0027s sake. The next thing I do is I put a couple of belts with lots of metal on them because it just feels good. [LAUGHS] It also keeps my pants up. OK, now I have to get the makeup on.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Absolutely. I don\u0027t have the ruffled shirts. They\u0027re all at the cleaners. Yeah, I don\u0027t have time to pick up another, so that\u0027s the best I can do. It\u0027s kind of got that look a bit. See? That\u0027s what I have under. But over, as I\u0027ll show you later, I have a nice sequined tux that I put over all of this. And I kind of take a couple of things off.",
        "Because I get real hot, you know what I mean? OK, got to have rings and bangles and bongles. I got the big cross because he always had the big cross. So now what I have to do first is tie up me own hair. Oh, I forgot. Also got to put the mascara on the chest hair.",
        "Five minutes late ain\u0027t no problem when Tom Jones is in the house."

Though, as you\u0027ll hear, we\u0027ve beeped out the nastiest words. And, number two-- and usually I would never point something like this out-- you need to know that Dael is a woman, an African-American woman. And I point this out because, If I didn\u0027t, you wouldn\u0027t be able to enjoy what the audience in the theater with her gets to enjoy, which is the pleasure of watching her complete transformation into this loudmouthed, white guy. So here\u0027s Dael Orlandersmith.",

There you go, baby, Sinatra, Jerry Vale. I swear on my mother, every Guinea wedding, Sinatra, Jerry Vale, right? So then, since all of us are in our \u002730s, the DJ started playing disco because that\u0027s what we danced to when we were kids, and [UNINTELLIGIBLE].",

You like jazz?\" So she said, \"Yeah.\" Lenny, I swear on my [BLEEP] mother, for the next three hours we\u0027re talkin\u0027 jazz.",

And my [BLEEP] record collection, man, I had Cannonball Adderley. I had Miles and Prez, you know? See, jazz, at that time, man, was like so a part of me, you know? But I can\u0027t touch it any more. You know what I\u0027m saying?",

And God, I swear to God, Lenny. This woman is so [BLEEP] beautiful to me now, right? And I\u0027m thinking well, yeah. Maybe, yeah, you know? I could pick up the horn again. You know? And she\u0027s just talkin\u0027 and talkin\u0027. And I swear she\u0027s the most beautiful thing I ever seen, right?",
            "And she tells me, she says-- I\u0027m gonna sound [BLEEP] queer saying this to you, all right-- but she says, \"Anthony, when you talk about music, your face becomes beautiful.\" Yeah, she said that to me, Lenny. She also called me a pain in the ass. But she said, when I talk music, I become beautiful.",

            "So, Lenny, all of a sudden-- wait a minute. Wait. I don\u0027t want nobody to hear this, right? All of a sudden, Lenny, sittin\u0027 there, talking about all these people that I liked in jazz, I felt like crying because I\u0027m not going to be able to touch it again. And nobody ever saw that in me before, you know? Nobody.",
            "So, anyway, we\u0027re talking. And she\u0027s really hot, you know? And I wanted to get outside because I was dying to ask for her phone number, right? Seconds later, TT walks out with the kids. \"Anthony, me and the kids are ready to go home. Now!\" Diane looks at me like I\u0027m [BLEEP] crazy, right? TT\u0027s standin\u0027 there looking like a [BLEEP] whale. What the [BLEEP] can I do? Bada bing. Bada bang. I introduce them to each other. Diane says, \"Pleased to meet you. I\u0027m outta here. I\u0027m doing the slide.\"",
            "That night, I take TT home, right? And dig this. Dig this. I go down in my basement, right? And, for the first time in five years, I pick up my sax. And it feels so [BLEEP] good to hold it, you know? Then I put it to my mouth, and with every note I can taste, feel, Diane. See, she\u0027s all over this [BLEEP] horn.",
            "Then I put the sax down, open my eyes, and it dawns on me I ain\u0027t going nowhere. I ain\u0027t going nowhere. But I could always do another shot of Johnny Black, right, babe? Well, wah, don\u0027t worry about me. I won\u0027t get junked. I can\u0027t. I gotta go to work tomorrow. But, you know, this is my time now, right? Just let me sit here for a few minutes, all right?

I\u0027m married 12 years. I got seven kids. I\u0027m a young man. I\u0027m [BLEEP] trapped. And TT\u0027s the laziest bitch in the world. No, no, hear me out. Here she is, 28 years old, looking 50. The problem is? The problem is I married too quick.",

So I\u0027ve always thought that screaming was essential to someone who-- not necessarily in the popular music idiom. But, in anything that had any kind of edge or soul to it, there\u0027s got to be a scream there, somewhere. And the whole reason is the same reason. It\u0027s a expression of the most inner, primal feelings.",

            "Now, nobody knew that I could sing. But there was a band, the Blood, Sweat \u0026 Tears, and the first version of them with Al Cooper. And there was a song on there called, \"I Love You More Than You\u0027ll Ever Know\", which is a real bluesy ballad. And I used to sing that over, and over, and over again in this music room. And so I ended up singing it.",
            "It was my first real performance, as me, in front of a stage, being the performer, like the Elvis or something. And I can remember having this silky shirt on. And I probably had my ID bracelet hanging. And I opened up my collar a little. And it was quite an experience, as I recall. And I think I did fairly well. I still do. I really sold it out, you know? I really started screaming there at the end.",

            "That band was called Zippers Polite and the Ambassadors of Love.",
            "It came to the point where every record company thought that the other record company was going to sign me. And, in effect, that I was going to be the next big thing. There were articles written saying that I was going to be the next Kiss, and this, and that. And Warner Brothers, they were going to have cartoons. And even where they were talking about designing some sort of video pinball game, a real total marketing thing.",
            "And I was so excited. And we were a couple of weeks away from signing the contract when OPEC had a oil embargo in 1979. The price of plastic went up 400%. And that was the end of my shot right there. It just vanished before my eyes.",
            "We ended up getting them to sign us up for a booking contract. And then, one night, they came up to us. And neither of these guys drank. They had ulcers. And they both walked around drinking a glass of milk. I remember, one day, they both walked up to me with a glass of milk, and they said, \"Would you mind wearing an Elvis mask?\"",
            "To make a long story short, the thing really kind of fell apart. And, at this point, I really got just totally discouraged with the whole scene. And, in fact, I remember just feeling like that what I really had inside me wasn\u0027t coming out. And I took this microphone-- I still have it to this day-- and I threw it up against the wall. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s all smashed in. I just left and never went back. I left everything I had that was related to music in that room, and just, basically, quit.",
            "But I like Alex. Alexes work. There aren\u0027t too many Alexes that are big these days, so I\u0027m sticking with that name. It\u0027s very catchy because people always remember Alex.",
            "I was sitting having dinner. And I heard this music in the lounge. And this chorus of women singing was beautiful. I said, \"I have to go in and hear this group.\" And I went in there, and there\u0027s no group. There\u0027s a guy who looks like he\u0027s sitting behind a keyboard. And he\u0027s got this big thing saying, \"You are the star. \"Sing the hits\", or something like that.",
            "And I\u0027m looking up. And there\u0027s a video playing of follow the bouncing ball. I didn\u0027t know anything about karaoke. And it just sounds fantastic. And I\u0027m saying, \"Jeez, all these years I\u0027ve been sitting around trying to wait for the drummer to show up, or the bass player\u0027s having a nervous breakdown. And here there\u0027s no band, they just have these laser disks. They play the music and you just go up and sing. Not only that, you don\u0027t even have to remember the words because they\u0027re showing you the words. They had a little monitor that faces up to you. I mean, this was a singer\u0027s delight. It was heaven.",
            "At the height of my interest in karaoke, easily, I was going out all seven nights.",
            "I feel authentic. I feel real. This is real.",
            "I like to put the leather pants on because it just feels good. But I forgot one thing. I\u0027ve got to put something in my pouch. The ladies love this. You\u0027ve got to roll it up so it\u0027s just about that thick, and then you fold it over, OK?",
            "And what you got there is a real peach.",
            "Absolutely.",
            "I had a jones for singing. I had an addiction.",
            "Authenticity\u0027s sake. The next thing I do is I put a couple of belts with lots of metal on them because it just feels good. [LAUGHS] It also keeps my pants up. OK, now I have to get the makeup on.",
            "Oh, absolutely.",
            "Absolutely. I don\u0027t have the ruffled shirts. They\u0027re all at the cleaners. Yeah, I don\u0027t have time to pick up another, so that\u0027s the best I can do. It\u0027s kind of got that look a bit. See? That\u0027s what I have under. But over, as I\u0027ll show you later, I have a nice sequined tux that I put over all of this. And I kind of take a couple of things off.",
            "Because I get real hot, you know what I mean? OK, got to have rings and bangles and bongles. I got the big cross because he always had the big cross. So now what I have to do first is tie up me own hair. Oh, I forgot. Also got to put the mascara on the chest hair.",

            "So we are now at Act Two, for those of you who are keeping careful, careful score. I know there\u0027s so many of you who are. Act Two is a story about somebody who decided to follow his dream, about being a musician. And, you know, usually, when you hear stories about somebody chasing a dream like this, stories about rock stars or Olympic athletes, or writers, or painters, or basically anybody who had to get out there and follow that star, follow that dream, we don\u0027t hear how crushingly hard it is for the overwhelming majority of them. And in the middle of the story, usually, you don\u0027t wonder is this worth it?",
            "Dan Gediman\u0027s story about his brother was produced by Jay Allison with consulting producer Christina Eckhoff. And it comes from Jay\u0027s series, Life Stories, which was produced with funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts.",
            "Dan and Jay are currently working on an upcoming series for NPR called, This I Believe. Their website for that, thisibelieve.org. Alex Jones can be hired to work as Tom Jones at private parties and corporate events, but he\u0027s working on a CD of his own music under the name Alex Space Jones.",
            "Coming up, other strategies to keep music in your life, if traditional music careers don\u0027t fly, from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues.",
            "It\u0027s This American Life, I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program we choose a theme and bring you a wide variety of stories, documentaries, radio monologues, reportage, found tapes and found documents, which is what I have right here in front of me. Our theme today, stories about people who you could say this about.",
            "Aha. And, of course, not everybody agrees about this beauty. Some people do not find it touching or inspiring to see people who love music. In fact, there are people who believe that loving music is a crisis of global proportions.",
            "And the document I hold in my hands is an advertisement, a call to arms really, from Motorbooty, a zine, a pretty great zine. And it\u0027s an advertisement for the First Annual Conference on World Band Population, on stopping the crisis of world band overpopulation, specifically.",
            "Says this ad, \"According to recent studies, by the year 2001 there will be more people in bands than the global economy can ever hope to support. The US Census Bureau puts the current number of audience members to band members at a ratio of 2:1. The present trends threatened to reverse this relationship, disrupting the delicate balance between performers and normal people. Soon, not only will virtually everyone be in a band, but everyone in a band will be involved in several side projects, creating a glut of virtually indistinguishable groups of guitar-wielding miscreants who, when not performing their so-called music, will be endlessly talking about it to anyone unable to flee.\"",
            "And then the ad explains what\u0027s going to happen at the conference. The seminars dealing with the imminent dangers of band overpopulation, Legal Strategies for Achieving Zero Band Population Growth, Private Sector Initiatives for Ending Band Growth, Strategies for Ending Multiple Band Membership.",
            "Here\u0027s some of the things that they suggest can be done to combat this global crisis, let\u0027s see, three-strikes-and-you\u0027re-out rules; creating stiff criminal penalties for artists who release more than three full-length albums per career; waiting periods for instrument purchasers to allow for mandatory background checks for prior infractions, and a cooling-off period to discourage thoughtless and impulsive band formation; stiff fines for bands that imitate other bands; civil infractions for air bands, and an all-out ban on cover bands.",
            "They also suggest-- let\u0027s see-- boycotting labels that refuse to stop signing additional bands as well as cracking down on pointless, local, so-called, indie labels; finally, supporting random band testing by employers, especially in high-risk businesses like coffee shops, copy shops, cafes, bars, and record stores.",
            "Well, given the crisis of global band population explosion, perhaps the only honorable course for all of us is to forget about performing and just put that energy into being members of the audience. And what we present next on our program, as Act Three, is a case example of how to do exactly that.",
            "Well, the story you\u0027re about to hear does not have that shortcoming. You definitely wonder. The story you\u0027re about to hear was produced by Jay Allison with Dan Gediman. Dan is the one who narrates the story.",

            "A few months after I interviewed him, my brother got laid off from his computer job. My parents told me they were pretty worried about him. Now he\u0027s playing the stock market, trying to parlay his retirement money into a nest egg that will carry him for a while until he makes it big with his Tom Jones act.",

            "I wanted to hear that he was making them happy. I wanted him to succeed. I wanted to help him get more work. I wanted to hear that they loved him.",
            "My brother sang constantly in our house when we were growing up. He always wanted to be a rock star or the next great soul singer. Once he was out on his own, he sang everywhere he could. And he still does, anywhere he can find an audience to appreciate him.",

            "My brother\u0027s been in countless rock, blues, and R\u0026B bands over the years. But, these days, he\u0027s mostly hired as a Tom Jones impersonator. He does that by night, though. During the day, he holds down a straight job.",
            "My brother performs with a revue called The Hall of Fame Superstars. There\u0027s a Patsy Cline, an Elton John, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison. And then my brother closes the show as Tom Jones.",
            "My brother is nothing, if not confident, at least on the surface. He thinks positive and has an uncanny, almost, overconfidence. It\u0027s an amazing quality, really, even unsettling.",
            "My brother\u0027s 43, not married, doesn\u0027t have kids. He\u0027s had a lot of girlfriends, but he doesn\u0027t have a steady one now. These days, he\u0027s living at home with my parents in Massachusetts.",

            "And I still know the song. And I went out and bought the record, by the way, about five years ago. And I have it. And the only reason I know that album is because of you.",
            "But, I remember, I was imitating you complete with undoing my shirt. I felt like a celebrity, even though the other kids didn\u0027t know it, because, god, my brother, he just did this thing. And so I was pretty impressed.",
            "My brother\u0027s middle name is Alex. He bumped it up to the front.",
            "My brother left music completely for many years after this time, around 1984. For a while he dabbled with a little home recording setup trying to write some songs, but his heart wasn\u0027t in it. He stopped going out to clubs, lost touch with most of his musician friends, didn\u0027t play, didn\u0027t perform, just left. Then, in 1991, seven years later, he discovered karaoke.",
            "After that, he was hooked.",

            "Well, let\u0027s start with an easier one. What do you think is the average length of a Fastbacks song?",
            "I got this package. Inside was a letter, thanking me for mentioning the Fastbacks in a book review I had written, not from one of the Fastbacks themselves, mind you, just some guy in Chicago. His name was Scott Lee, and he\u0027d enclosed this xerox booklet about the band.",
            "When do you think you made the switch between just being a listener and being, as Kurt Bloch called you today, a super-fan?",
            "When you show this info packet to people, what is usually their reaction?",
            "In fact, Scott\u0027s spare time is limited. He holds down a full-time job at a Chicago advertising agency, and he writes his own songs. And, truthfully, he flirts with the idea of not staying a fan. He\u0027s moving to Seattle, partly to be closer to the Fastbacks. He\u0027s actually in their circle of friends now. And he\u0027s tried a couple of times to start his own band.",
            "Once, he was invited on-stage with Kurt to play along with the song. It was exciting. But he\u0027s left-handed. And they didn\u0027t have a left-handed guitar for him. So it was sort of a disaster, not the moment a super-fan dreams of.",
            "So, in this show, what happens is someone tells their little story and then we play a song. So you get to pick which Fastbacks song gets to play at the end of your story.",
            "Flipping through it, I stopped cold at something called, \"The Fastback\u0027s Drummers Pie Chart\". Since they formed in 1979, the Fastbacks have gone through about a dozen drummers. And this pie chart identifies the drummers by name, listing the percentage of songs which each one has contributed to. But, at the bottom of the page, small print warns, \"Note, Rusty and Nate\u0027s shares may not be totally accurate. Their percentages may be approximately 0.68% off.\" And I don\u0027t think a decimal point had ever struck me as endearing before. The drastic exactitude of 0.68% sort of captured my heart, and I had to meet this person.",
            "So he showed me other stats, like total recorded versions of songs, total number of seconds of songs, which is 30,343, in case you were wondering.",
            "I was stunned. I mean, I thought I liked the band. And, normally, as a music lover and as a woman, I rail against the mostly-male, record-collector geek habit of reducing rock and roll to baseball card collecting. They flatten out this complex, thrilling thing down to manageable lists of names and titles and dates.",
            "But Scott Lee\u0027s Fastbacks tribute has the devotional fervour of a medieval illuminated manuscript. The list of facts and figures is so relentless and exact and painstaking that it takes on this liturgical glow, as if the Fastbacks were a religion and Scott Lee its prophet."

And, despite how cold it was, when I listened to this music, it really just pumped all this life into me. It was really a life-affirming experience, as corny as that might sound.

            "Act Four, A Life in Music. Sam Franco\u0027s 72 and has spent his life playing and teaching the accordion. And the thing to know about him is he hates accordion music, most of it, anyway.",
            "He\u0027s watched players who weren\u0027t any better than him get a lot of attention, get notoriety, get more gigs. And, in the end, he decided he doesn\u0027t care. That life doesn\u0027t suit him.",
            "Most of the people who Sam started playing with back when he was a kid did not stay with music. Back when Sam began, accordion was huge, huge. Every band in Chicago had an accordionist doing their keyboards because pianos, in those days, were so impractical, you know? You can\u0027t carry them around. The one that you find at the hall is always out of tune.",
            "But that era did not last. When Elvis hit in the late \u002750s and rock and roll followed, accordion business died. Nobody hired them. Nobody wanted to take lessons. And lots of guys who Sam played and taught with quit the music business.",
            "Sam had always played guitar too. And he was actually one of the few people in his crowd who made the jump from the swing era to the rock era. These days, he jokes that every brick of his house was paid for by rock and roll. A big poster of electric guitarist, Randy Rhoads, is the biggest thing in his music room. He taught lessons for years on the guitar. But Sam still views the guitar as an inferior instrument. He can lecture you for a long time on how it\u0027s not in the symphony orchestra. Basically, in his view, America\u0027s 40-year love affair with the guitar is a concerted effort to slap back at the accordion.",
            "I met Sam through one of his students, Catherine Boyd, who totally adores Sam, has known him for years and says that, whatever goes on in Sam\u0027s life, he\u0027s always happy when he\u0027s talking about music.",
            "And the most surprising thing Sam told me when we talked is that it took him a long time before he was completely at peace with the way he plays. He started playing accordion when he was 10. He\u0027s 72 now. He played accordions back in the old neighborhood on Taylor Street as a kid. He found his way to the jazz sound that he loves by high school.",
            "He played in USO shows during World War II. He taught and gigged for the next half century. But he says he never felt good about his playing until he was in his \u002750s. Up until that point, the sound that he heard in his head wasn\u0027t what was coming out of the instrument. In his \u002750s, he said, he just stopped worrying about what people would say about his playing. He just played.",
            "Why is that?",
            "Today, in his music room, surrounded by his instruments, with one of his favorite students, Catherine, egging him on during our interview, Sam couldn\u0027t seem happier, really.",
            "[ACCORDIAN PLAYING]",
            "I see why you like it the other way.",
            "Sam Franco hates that accordion oom-pah beat. He doesn\u0027t like the normal Lawrence Welk chord progressions. In his music, he changes them into jazz chord progressions. And, where normal accordion players use lots of chords all over the place, he prefers to play single notes. In his head, when he plays, Sam hears Coleman Hawkins and other jazz greats. He invented this style. And, if you check the Chicago Yellow Pages for jazz accordion, Sam is the only listing.",

These days, he jokes that every brick of his house was paid for by rock and roll. A big poster of electric guitarist, Randy Rhoads, is the biggest thing in his music room. He taught lessons for years on the guitar. But Sam still views the guitar as an inferior instrument. He can lecture you for a long time on how it\u0027s not in the symphony orchestra. Basically, in his view, America\u0027s 40-year love affair with the guitar is a concerted effort to slap back at the accordion."

And there it was. It just came out as a rebel cause, I think. It only has five notes, a set of six strings. Two are the same, so it brings it down to five notes, you know? You have to hit it with a pick. You\u0027ve got to use two hands to make one note. Does that make sense? Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to use two hands to make one note?"
