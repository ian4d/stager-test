There was Robin S. Clark, who was just a freshman like them."

It took me six weeks to become well enough to leave the hospital. I told people I nearly became the first person to die from Shakespeare. It could be worse. Abraham Lincoln died from a lousy comedy.",

It began when a man pushed a wheelbarrow on stage, [UNINTELLIGIBLE] through a trap door that trundled down a ramp three feet from me. The guards ran onstage dressed in Green Beret uniforms. I was hooked.",
        "After that, I went to every performance I could. The festival allowed a friend in for free. So every summer, I rented vans equipped with wheelchair lifts to take us to the park. The season\u0027s tickets cost more than $100, expensive for someone living on SSI. But as a friend told me, culture is what we live for, the reason we put up with bills, smog, and [UNINTELLIGIBLE].",
        "The stage, surrounded by tall trees, faced a natural amphitheatre. I sat right next to the elevated stage [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. One of the light stands. One year, I bought two tickets for each performance. During a night performance of Coriolanus, the actor, the lead, dressed like a 20th century admiral, tore off his epaulets and hurled them offstage, nearly hitting me. The following week, the actor approached me before showtime.",
        "\"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re back,\" he said, \"I thought I might\u0027ve killed you with those epaulets.\" I was so excited to meet him that I forgot to ask for his autograph.",

One actor, who imitated Johnny Carson, who played the clown, Touchstone, for As You Like It-- the following week he was Richard II, the tyrannical, blustering king who becomes more eloquent, more human, after he\u0027s overthrown and imprisoned.",
        "After many years in the park, the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival moved to a new amphitheatre in the suburbs. The stage area is half a mile from the entrance. When we reached our seats, I saw there wasn\u0027t a speck of shade. At 4:00 in the afternoon, it was well over 80. We often suffer for the things we love. This could be as true of Shakespeare as anything else. As an English major accustomed to the five-word sentences and flat inflections of Californians, I found Shakespeare\u0027s heightened sense of language intoxicating. It\u0027s not just the thees and thous. It\u0027s the metaphors, the jokes, the rhythms of the poetry and the jostling, bubbling, prose. So I thought I would suffer gladly for these pleasures."

            "This time my mother, a high school dropout, was caught off guard. Members of her immediate family had done time in some serious mental institutions. And something suggested I might be next. I could tell by the state of my room that she spent the next day searching my dresser for drugs. The clothes I took pride in neatly folding were crammed tight into the doors with no regard for color or category. I smelled the evidence of cigarettes and noticed the coffee rings left on my desk.",
            "I loved my mother dearly. But mess with mine drawers, and ye have just made thineself an enemy. Tying a feather to the shaft of my ballpoint pen, I quilled her a letter.",
            "\"The thing that ye search for so desperately resideth not in mine well-ordered chambers, but in the questionable content of thine own character.\" I slipped the note into her purse, folded twice and sealed with wax from the candles I now used to light my room.",
            "I took to brooding, refusing to let up until I received a copy of Shakespeare\u0027s collected plays. Reading them, though, just didn\u0027t provide the kick I\u0027d hoped for. I found it more enjoyable to simply carry the book from room to room, occasionally skimming for fun words I might toss into my ever-fragrant vocabulary. The dinner hour became either unbearable or excruciatingly, depending on my mood.",
            "\"Me thinks, kind sir, most gentle lady, fellow siblings all, that this barnyard fowl be most tasty and succulent, having simmered in its own sweet juices for such a time as it might take the sun to pass, rosy and full-fingered, across the plum-colored sky for the course of a twilight hour. \u0027Tis crisp yet juicy, this plump bird, satisfied in the company of such finely roasted neighbors. Hear me out, fine relations, and heed my words. For me thinks it adventurous, and fanciful too, to saddle mine fork with both foul and carrot at the exact same time, the twin juices blending together in a delicate harmony which doth cajole and enliven the tongue in a spirit of unbridled merriment. What say ye, fine father, sisters, and infant brother too, that we raise our flagons high in celebration of this hearty feast, prepared lovingly and with tender grace by this dutiful woman we have the good fortune to address as our wife, wench, or mother?\"",
            "My enthusiasm knew no limits. And as a result, it quickly reached the point where my mother literally begged me to wait in the car while she stepped into the bank or the grocery store. I was at the orthodontist\u0027s office, placing a pox upon the practice of dentistry, when the visiting actor returned to our classroom.",
            "\"You missed it, my friend Lois said, the man was so indescribably powerful that I was practically crying. That\u0027s how brilliant he was. I can\u0027t describe it any better than that,\" she placed her chain in her hand and stared out the window into the parking lot. \"There\u0027s absolutely nothing left for me to say about it, nothing. I could try to explain his realness, but you\u0027d never be able to understand it.\"",
            "Lois and I had been friends for six months when our relationship suddenly took on a competitive edge. I\u0027d never cared who made better grades or had the most spending money. We each had our strengths. The important thing was to honor one another for the thing they did best. Lois complained better than I did. And I respected her for that. Her grotesque excess of self-confidence allowed her to march into school wearing a rust-colored Afro wig. And I stood behind her 100%. She had more records than I did. And because she was a year older, she also knew how to drive a car and did so as if she were rushing to a fire.",
            "Fine, I thought, good for her. I was genuinely happy for Lois until she questioned my ability to understand the visiting actor. I was the one who identified his brilliance in the first place. Me, not her. Sure, she\u0027d been there beside me in the classroom, but she didn\u0027t even realize that was an invisible wall until I told her. When he\u0027d come in with his Shakespeare, she\u0027d been just like the rest of them, laughing at his neck brace and rolling her eyes at the tangerine-sized lump in his tights. Now she was telling me that I couldn\u0027t understand him? Me think not.",
            "\"Honestly woman,\" I said to my mother on our way to the dry cleaner, \"To think that this low-lying worm might speak to me of greatness as though it were a thing invisible to mine eyes is more than I can bear. Her words doth strike mine heart with the force of a punishing blow, leaving me both stunned and highly vexed too. Hear me though, for I shall bide my time quietly and with cunning, striking back at the very hour she doth least expect it. Such an affront shall not go unchallenged. Of that you may rest assured, gentle mother. My vengeance will hold the sweet taste of the ripest berry. And I shall savor it slowly and with gusto.\"",
            "The man was sent to our school in order to inspire us. And personally speaking, I thought he did an excellent job. After introducing himself in a relaxed and casual manner, he started towards the back of the room, only to be stopped midway by what we came to know as \"the invisible wall,\" that transparent barrier realized only by mimes, drug addicts, and certain varieties of rapid cycling psychotics. I sat enthralled as he righted himself and began investigating the imaginary wall with his open palms, running his hands over the hard, smooth surface in hopes of finding a way out. Moments later he was tugging an invisible rope, then struggling in the face of a violent, fantastic wind.",
            "\"You\u0027ll get over it,\" my mother said. \"Give it a few weeks and the whole thing will blow over.\"",
            "This would become her answer to everything. She\u0027d done some asking around and concluded that I\u0027d been bitten by what her sister called, the drama bug. My mother was convinced that this was just a phase like all the others. A few weeks of prancing and I\u0027d drop show business just like I had the guitar and my private detective agency. I hated having my life\u0027s ambition reduced to the level of a common cold. This wasn\u0027t a bug but a full-fledged virus. It might lay low for a year or two, but this little germ would never go away. It had nothing to do with talent. Rejection wouldn\u0027t weaken it and no amount of success could ever satisfy it.",
            "The drama bug strikes hardest with Jews, homosexuals, and plump women who wear their hair in bangs. These are people who, for one reason or another, desperately crave attention. I would later learn that it\u0027s a bad idea to gather more than two of these people in an enclosed area for any amount of time. \"Stage\" is not an actual place but rather a state of mind related to one\u0027s whereabouts during the time you\u0027re not asleep. \"Audience\" defines anyone pausing long enough for you to interrupt. We were a string of light bulbs left burning 24 hours a day. And as a result, our exhausted public soon stopped wondering what all the fuss was about.",
            "[MUSIC- \"BRUSH UP YOUR SHAKESPEARE\" BY CYBILL SHEPHERD]",
            "You know you\u0027re living in a small town when you can reach the ninth grade without ever having seen a mime. As far as I was concerned, this man was a prophet, a genius, a pioneer in the field of entertainment. And here he was in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was a riot the way he imitated the teacher, turning down the corners of his mouth and rifling through his imaginary purse in search of gum and aspirin. Was this guy funny or what?",
            "I went home and demonstrated the invisible wall for my infant brother, who pounded at the very real wall beside his bed, shrieking and wailing in disgust. When my mother asked what I\u0027d done to provoke him, I threw up my hands in mock innocence, before lowering them to retrieve the imaginary baby which lay fussing at my feet. I patted the back of my little ghost in order to induce gas and was investigating its soiled diaper when I noticed my mother\u0027s face assume an expression she reserved for unspeakable horror. I had seen this look only twice before-- once when she was caught in the path of a charging, rabid pig and once again when I told her I wanted a peach-colored velveteen blazer with matching slacks.",
            "\"I don\u0027t know who put you up to this,\" she said, \"But I\u0027ll kill you myself before I watch you grow up to be a clown. You want to diaper a baby? Make yourself useful and wipe up the genuine article.\" She handed me my brother before turning to leave the room. Because I respected her opinion, I did as I was told, ending my career in mime with a whimper, rather than the silent bang I had hoped for.",
            "The visiting actor returned to the classroom a few months later, removing his topcoat to reveal a black body stocking worn with a putty-colored neck brace, the result of a recent automobile accident. This afternoon\u0027s task was to introduce us to the works of William Shakespeare. And once again, I was completely captivated by his charm and skill. When the words became confusing, you needed only pay attention to the actor\u0027s face and hands to know that this particular character was not just angry, but vengeful.",
            "I loved the undercurrent of hostility that lay beneath the surface of this deceptively beautiful language. It seemed a shame that people no longer spoke this way. And I undertook a campaign to reintroduce Elizabethan English to the citizens of Raleigh.",
            "\"Perchance, fair lady, thou dost think me unduly vexed at the sorrowful state of thine quarters,\" I said to my mother as I ran the vacuum over the living room carpet she was inherently too lazy to bother with. \"These foul specks, the evidence of life itself, have sullied not only thine shag-tempered mat, but also thine character. Be ye mad, woman? Were it a crime to neglect thine dwellings, you, my feeble-spirited mistress, would hang from the tallest venerable tree in penitence for your shameful ways.",
            "Be there not linens to both launder and iron free of turbulence? See ye not the porcelain plates and hearty mugs waiting to be washed clean of evidence? Get thee to thine work, damnable lady, and quickly, before the products of thine very loins raise their collected fists in a spirit born of rage and indignation, forcibly coaxing the last breath from the foul chamber of thine vain and upright throat. Go now, wastrel, and get to it.\""

And they seem happy about it.",

            "Before rehearsal can begin there have to be, of course, announcements. Katie has ordered Lost in Yonkers t-shirts for the cast. T-shirts from the various plays that they\u0027ve been in seem to make up a significant part of the daily high school wardrobe of this cast.",
            "This is actually a little joke. \"This is not a bank,\" is a line from the play. As the cast spends more and more time together, they\u0027re starting to form their own little subculture full of references to the play and jokes that only they get. The Lost in Yonkers actors can get a laugh out of each other simply by saying the phrase, General Erwin Rommel, or, who was the friend?",
            "And, touchingly, it\u0027s hard for them not to use these phrases out in their regular lives as well with people who don\u0027t know that these are lines from the play. They don\u0027t know that these are jokes.",

And see if it isn\u0027t running through your head all the time, laying in wait for some conversational gap into which it can drive its powerful force.",
            "At one point, Kim got the idea that they should all go out to eat together at a restaurant in character. As Tiffany explains, they did drive together in one car, piling into somebody\u0027s tiny compact whatever, asked for a table for seven for the Kurnitz family, which is their name in the play. But then they kind of lost their nerve. They didn\u0027t really play the characters.",

Though, Max is quick to tell you, if you should ask him, that he\u0027s been in lots of plays, drama club shows in grade school, stretching all the way back to his role as Joseph in his first grade Christmas pageant.",
            "To play grandma, Tiffany Moore uses this metal cane during rehearsals. And it\u0027s become this all-purpose prop that she uses for expressing her moods, waving it around in the air, pointing it at people. At this point, she slams it against the ground. The assistant director, the stage manager, and the director, Mr. Simon, sit in the audience with scripts in hand and feed lines.",
            "Max, when you talk about this, you sound like such an old pro.",
            "The Village Players. Sure, they\u0027re not a real professional company. Sure, they\u0027re out in the suburbs, they\u0027re not down in the city. Sure, they\u0027re all volunteers. But they\u0027re adults. Not many boys go out for drama at Oak Park and River Forest high school. And directors often have trouble filling the male roles. And part of being in high school drama means putting up with friends who do not look too kindly on the entire endeavor.",
            "An awkward silence falls amongst the three of us for a moment. Ben seems to know that what they\u0027ve just said is a little strange, maybe a little offensive, because he makes a noise as if he\u0027s about to say something else. Then he looks at Max, looks down, rocks in place moment, and decides that he\u0027s not going to say anything.",
            "Kim Plostina plays Aunt Gertie in the show. It\u0027s a small role, but the kind of small character part that can steal entire scenes. Kim wants to be an actress. And, while most of the cast is considering acting and theater as one option for their lives, Kim is certain. But she suffers from a handicap that the others do not. Her father is a professional actor. He does a lot of college industrial films.",
            "Maybe he seems how hard it is for him.",
            "Years ago, at the Shady Lane Theater in Marengo, Illinois, her father was in shows with a young David Hasselhoff. And seeing his daughter fall in love with the theater-- it must be a kind of ordeal for him, the kind of test that every parent dreads. Should he discourage her in the thing she loves if it worries him so? But lately, Kim says, he\u0027s gone through a big change. He told her that he\u0027s going to introduce her to an agent. He\u0027s going to help her get auditions.",
            "Six days before opening night, they run the play for the first time on the stage with the beginnings of a set, chairs representing where furniture will go. And there is a problem, there seems to be no way to put a table and sofabed on the stage and still have room for entrances and exits. So the cast converges on stage.",
            "At this point, a surreal scene gets even more surreal. For the next eight minutes, Jeff lays on the floor, his head under a chair, as six people walk around him arguing. He is placid. He is happy. He is the consummate professional. And this is part of why you do theater in high school. It\u0027s not just the place where you can get applause and approval. As Tiffany says, this is the most intense problem solving, the most serious, concentrated work that she does in high school.",
            "But for example, do things happen in class that are as intense as that little discussion in your real classes?",
            "In the sound closet are the crew guys, the techies, who run the lights and the sound and build the set and handle the props. Anybody who\u0027s ever done theater anywhere will tell you about the ancient rivalry between cast and crew. There are 45 crew members for three theaters at Oak Park and River Forest High School. And they constitute kind of a permanent government. Actors come and go. Shows come and go. But crew members, they\u0027re there every week. And frankly, it can be a little irritating to them that the actors think that they\u0027re all that, when the crew really runs the show. At this school, they all have special hall passes. They all answer to a teacher that they all refer to simply as, \"Boss.\" They all insist that you spell crew, C-R-U-E, as in Motley Crue. And don\u0027t forget that umlaut. Senior Jon Huber has done 57 shows.",
            "Jon says there\u0027s a lot of prejudice against crew. Some teachers think that they\u0027re slackers, and smokers, and drug users. People don\u0027t notice the charity work crew does. People haven\u0027t noticed that so many more girls are now on crew. Though that does threaten some crew traditions.",
            "Do you think there\u0027s anything positive about the way the girls want to do it?",
            "At that point, he turned back to his own work. Cues were being missed and opening night was just a few nights away. We arrive there in a minute when our program continues.",
            "It\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Our story about the Oak Park and River Forest High School production of Lost in Yonkers continues with opening night.",
            "Minutes before the curtain rises, Laura is still being made up. She\u0027s sick with what turns out later to be pnemonia. Mr. Simon has given her another set of pep talks about making her character childlike and not too smart. She shivers and runs to the stage. No opening night is complete without some kind of small crisis. For Lost in Yonkers, it involves a form-fitting, sleeveless t-shirt that Jeff is supposed to wear on stage.",
            "Actually, the show\u0027s not in bad shape. The actors are mastering their accents, blocking, basic characters, they\u0027re all down. Tiffany\u0027s on stage with Laura Lopardo and both of them are old pros, veterans of seven other high school plays. Laura plays Bella, a slightly retarded 35-year-old woman. Laura is one of the strongest performers in this cast. She\u0027s very soulful. But she\u0027s also Mr. Simon\u0027s biggest worry. When he critiques the actors at the end of each rehearsal, he mostly tells the other actors to watch their accents or try some little moment a little differently. But at rehearsal after rehearsal he has the same criticism for Laura. Her character is still not there, he says.",
            "There are two types of actors, the kind who\u0027d love nothing more than to reveal more of their own bodies on stage and the kind who can get a little self-conscious. Jeff is squarely in that second camp. He thinks he\u0027s too big for a tight t-shirt. And on the side of the dressing room, he sits, muttering bitterly that wearing the t-shirt will hurt his performance. Everyone goes backstage. It\u0027s all shadows and darkness and the dim, blue work lights. For six weeks, they\u0027ve planned for this moment and practiced for it and wondered about it. And now, for the first time, they get to see if they were right about what would make sense to the audience. And early in the first scene, it happens. They get their first laugh.",
            "A few scenes later, Jeff, who\u0027s playing a small-time Jewish gangster, is supposed to strip to his sleeveless t-shirt. He unbuttons his outer shirt, revealing the tight t-shirt underneath. And there he stops. He never takes off his outer shirt. His character, Uncle Louie, simply decides to climb in bed wearing a dress shirt. Backstage, I catch up with him.",
            "During intermission, Mr. Simon came backstage and congratulated all the actors. And he told Jeff that he looked ridiculous. Still, Jeff got more laughs than anyone in the cast. And Mr. Simon resolved to get him a looser-fitting t-shirt for future performances. Opening night, by any measure, was a wildly successful night of theater. They all got laughs. Everyone kept their accents. Everyone remembered their lines. And while everyone was good, Laura, Tiffany, and Jeff were stand-outs."

            "I had the drama bug and Lois had a car. This being the case, I quickly forgave her when informed that the visiting actor had scheduled a production of Hamlet set to take place at the amphitheatre of the Raleigh Rose Garden. He, himself, would direct and play the title role. But the other parts were up for grabs. We went to the audition, and, because we were the youngest, Lois and I were assigned the roles of the traveling players Hamlet uses to bate his Uncle Claudius. It wasn\u0027t the part I was hoping for, but I accepted it with a quiet dignity. I still had a few speeches and planned to use them to the best of my ability, outshining the other actors who were all much older than I.",
            "They were in their 20s and 30s and carried years of experience in such long-running outdoor dramas as The Lost Colony and Tender is the Lamb. These were professionals and I hoped to benefit from their experience, sitting literally at their feet as the director paced the lip of the stage, addressing his clenched fist as, \"poor Yorick.\"",
            "I worshipped these people. Lois slept with them. By the second week of rehearsal, she had taken up with Laertes, who she claimed had a real way with the sword. Unlike me, she was embraced by the older crowd, attending late-night keg parties with Polonius and Ophelia, driving to the lake with the director while Gertrude and Rosenkrantz made out in the backseat.",
            "The killer was that Lois was nowhere near as committed as I was. Her drama bug was the equivalent of a 24-hour-flu. Yet there she was, swimming naked with the director himself, while I practiced lines alone in my room.",
            "As traveling players, it was decided that we would make our entrance tumbling onto the stage. When Lois complained that the grass was irritating her skin, the director examined the wee pimples on her back and decided that, rather than tumbling, the players would enter skipping. I had practiced my tumble until my brain lost its mooring and could be heard rattling in my skull. And now, on the basis of one complaint, we were skipping.",
            "He\u0027d already cut out all of my speeches, leaving me with one line, \"Aye, my Lord.\" While the other actors strolled the rose gardens memorizing their vengeful soliloquies, I skipped back and forth across the parking lot whispering, \"Aye, my Lord. Aye, my Lord.\" Lois felt silly skipping and spoke to the director, who praised her instincts and announced that henceforth, the players would enter walking.",
            "The less I had to do, the more my fellow actors used me as a personal slave. I would have been happy to help them run lines. But instead, they wanted me to polish their crowns or trot out to the car and search the floorboards for their dagger.",
            "\"Looking for something to do? You can help Dugan glow tape the stage,\" the director said. \"You can chase the spiders out of the dressing room, or better yet, run to the store. Who wants drinks?\"",
            "Not only did Lois lay in the shade doing nothing, but she was the first one to hand me a $20 bill when placing an order for a $0.30 candy bar. During rehearsal breaks, she huddled with the actors while I was off anchoring ladders for one of the technicians. When it came time for our big scene, Lois recited her lines as if she were reading the words from the surface of some distant billboard. She squinted and paused between syllables, punctuating each word with a question mark. If the director had a problem with her performance, he kept it to himself.",
            "I, on the other hand-- I needed to remove the sweater from around my neck, walk slower, and drop the accent. It might have been easier to accept the criticism had he spread it around a little, but that seemed unlikely. She could enter the stage with a slice of pizza in one hand and a Dr. Pepper in the other and that was fine, Lois, just great.",
            "By this point, I was finding my own way home from rehearsal. Lois couldn\u0027t give me a ride if she was always rushing off to some party or restaurant with, what she referred to as, \"the gang from Elsinore.\" I would wave them off and wait in the parking lot for one of my parents to drive me home.",
            "\"The thing to remember,\" my mother said, \"Is that 10 years from now, you could wake up underneath one of these people and have no idea you\u0027d ever even seen them before. Time passes. You\u0027ll see. Enough liquor and people can forget anything. Don\u0027t let it get to you. If nothing else, it\u0027s taught you to skim the change while buying their drinks.\"",
            "I didn\u0027t appreciate her casual attitude. But the business with the change was insightful. My mother had the vengeful part down. It was the craft of acting I thought she knew nothing about.",
            "We were in dress rehearsal when the director approached Lois in regards to a production he had planned for the fall. This was to be a musical based on the lives of roving gypsies, and he had her in mind for the role of a lusty bandit. Lois couldn\u0027t sing. Everybody knew that. Neither could she act or play the tambourine. I watched the man kneel down in the grass and literally beg her to accept the part.",
            "When I expressed an interest, he suggested I might enjoy working behind the scenes in some backstage capacity. He meant for me to hang lights or lug scenery, to turn into one of those guys with low-riding pants and a belt burdened with wrenches and thick roles of gaffer\u0027s tape. Anyone thinking I might be trusted with electrical wiring had to be a complete idiot. And that\u0027s what this man was.",
            "I looked at him clearly then, noticing how his tights made a mockery of his slack calves and dumpy little basket. If he was such a big, stinking deal, what was he doing in Raleigh, North Carolina? His blow-dried hair, the Cuban-heeled shoes and rainbow-striped suspenders-- it was all a sham. Why wear tights with suspenders when their only redeeming feature was that they promised to stay up on their own?",
            "And acting? The man performed as though everyone around him sported a shrimp-sized hearing aid clamped to their ear. He shouted his lines, grinning like a jack-o-lantern and flailing his hands as if he were fighting off gnats. His was a form of acting that never fails to embarrass me. It\u0027s the same feeling I get when watching someone hawk a vegetable slicer or deliver a singing telegram. You know it\u0027s supposed to sound convincing. But you can\u0027t get beyond the sad fact that this person actually thinks he\u0027s bringing some joy into your life. Somewhere he\u0027s got a mother sifting through a shoe box of mimeographed playbills, pouring herself another drink and wondering when her son is going to come to his senses and swallow some drain cleaner.",
            "I saw Hamlet for the man he was and, in the process, saw myself as a sort of sad sack Yorick who would blindly follow along behind him.",
            "My parents attended the opening night performance. Following my, \"Aye, my Lord,\" I laid on the grass as Lois poured a false vile of poison into my ear. As I lay dying, I opened my eyes enough to see my father sleeping, my mother stretched out beside him fighting off the moths who, along with a few dozen humans, had been attracted by the bright light.",
            "There was a cast party afterwards, but I didn\u0027t go. I changed my clothes in the dressing room where the actors stood congratulating one another. Horatio asked me to run to the store for some cigarettes and I pocketed his money, promising to return with lightning speed.",
            "\"You were the best in the whole show,\" my mother said, stopping for frozen pizza on her way home. \"I mean it. You walked onto that stage and all eyes went right for you.\" It occurred to me then that my mother was a better actor than I could ever hope to be. Acting is different than posing or pretending. When done well, it bears a striking resemblance to lying. I didn\u0027t envy my mother\u0027s skill. Neither did I contradict her. That\u0027s how convincing she was. It seemed best, sitting beside her with a frozen pizza thawing on my lap, to simply sit back and learn."

This could be as true of Shakespeare as anything else. As an English major accustomed to the five-word sentences and flat inflections of Californians, I found Shakespeare\u0027s heightened sense of language intoxicating. It\u0027s not just the thees and thous. It\u0027s the metaphors, the jokes, the rhythms of the poetry and the jostling, bubbling, prose. So I thought I would suffer gladly for these pleasures."
