But that barbecue is inherently enlightening into matters of a more ontological nature. And there were waiters and waitresses roaming the room, serving food, for the gathered horde did not understand proper methodology of a barbecue. At these sights I fled, for I had seen enough evils, and their mere presence was nearly overpowering."

Dear Kara, Hey, I haven\u0027t written to you in a long time. I had been in the midst of a personal and emotional whirlwind. Whoosh, and the wind went rushing through my brain and into my body chemistry. And God spoke to me and said, get a grip, dude. Whereas you\u0027ve been sitting at work wishing you were on vacation, I\u0027ve been sitting in my parents\u0027 house and on the couches of several friends wishing that I had work to do.

It was certainly a pleasure to hang out in Paris. Hoping to hear from you soon. Why not send along some writing samples, so that we may begin to fully share our literary interests and creations?

Oh sure, I can do a flying squirrel. I was a writer, and Jay Ward does not read. And the only way he knew what was in the script, was if I would read them to him."

For god\u0027s sake, please record the Hoppitys. I\u0027ve never seen one of them. I wrote the Hoppity episodes, I think. Though I may have rewritten somebody else\u0027s stuff. Tell you better after I see them. I can usually recognize my own stuff. I also did the voice of Fillmore Bear, but I was in a period of relative modesty at the time, and was in favor of just taking one credit on a show, preferably the highest in the production hierarchy.

Because shortly after receiving the fourth letter from him, Bill Scott had a heart attack and died at the age of 65. And so, while that may have been a sad thing, one thing that they did say at the festival was that-- somebody asked, why did they stop doing the show?

Playwright David Hauptschein and I have advertised, inviting people to a very intimate theater in Chicago called the Lunar Cabaret, maybe 85 or 90 people in here. And we\u0027ve invited them to bring letters-- ones they have gotten, ones they have sent, ones they have found-- to read on stage. And our next reader."

Just a few short minutes ago, I walked over to the faculty dining room in Skibo. There was a physics department barbecue that was supposed to be going on. I wasn\u0027t sure if I should go. I mean, it\u0027s free food, and that can be hard to pass up. Plus, if it\u0027s a real barbecue, it\u0027ll be free beef, real food, for real people, what\u0027s for dinner, my favorite food."

        "Well, that letter was a good example, actually. I used to host a lot of spoken word events, fiction, poetry readings. And I found the events were getting predictable. I was getting bored by a lot of the writing.",
        "I think when people write just for themselves or to one other person, they are not looking over their shoulder at literary conventions. They are not worried about what the editor is going to say. They\u0027re not worried about, a lot of times, sounding dumb. And consequently, they\u0027re much freer with their expression, both stylistically and in terms of what they\u0027re willing to talk about.",
        "For example, barbecue. A man\u0027s obsessed with barbecue, he\u0027ll write about barbecue if it\u0027s an email. But if he\u0027s going to a poetry reading, most likely he won\u0027t read about barbecue. He\u0027ll probably read a poem about apartheid or something like that, something politically important. And they are very unpredictable. And it\u0027s just--",
        "Yeah, it\u0027s more raw. Really, what I\u0027m interested in, is getting inside people\u0027s heads. And I really like the letters-- this is my personal interest-- when I feel like I\u0027m looking at someone\u0027s subconscious and seeing how they really are, whether it\u0027s a found letter, or whatever.",

        "My letter is written on the back of a CBGB\u0027s flyer from New York, from a guy that I met while I was in Paris. He was cycling through Europe. Dear Kara, Hey, I haven\u0027t written to you in a long time. I had been in the midst of a personal and emotional whirlwind. Whoosh, and the wind went rushing through my brain and into my body chemistry. And God spoke to me and said, get a grip, dude. Whereas you\u0027ve been sitting at work wishing you were on vacation, I\u0027ve been sitting in my parents\u0027 house and on the couches of several friends wishing that I had work to do. Without the stable base of my own place, it was indeed difficult to focus on anything. Socializing? Yes. Continued cycling around? Yes. Work? Absolutely no.",
        "Right now, as I write to you, I am glowing like a pregnant woman. After several weeks of trying to get in this film production company, playing my cards and doing spot jobs for the dude who runs it-- who is our age, is the son of a Time-Warner Company huge corporate executive, has access to the mass media, as well as access to, no kidding, millions of dollars-- I\u0027ve emerged with, yes, a job. How fortunate for me and my wonderful temperament and abilities. He needs me to save his project, to co-rewrite the story, as well as edit the thing, a short 30 minute film-poem on the Hudson Valley of Upstate New York.",
        "He is letting me put my whole lower leg in the door, never mind my foot. I am excited and ready to begin work. I am going to do a great job for him. So now, I am slightly more sane, more filled with better cheer, and open to a little sharing and communication with several individuals. It is a pleasure to correspond with you. It was certainly a pleasure to hang out in Paris. Hoping to hear from you soon. Why not send along some writing samples, so that we may begin to fully share our literary interests and creations? Love and kisses, Sparky. PS, thank you so much for the photos. I look pretty good. I\u0027m shocked."

        "This is age 16. Dear Adam, I can lose my guard best when I write. No wonder I scared off S with my letters. Speaking of which, I didn\u0027t hear from him. You see, how can I ever think of hurting you like that? Let\u0027s say something starts between us. What about S? I may not like him, but maybe I do. Also, what if I\u0027m just on the rebound from Dave? Not that I didn\u0027t like you before. Maybe I\u0027m just free to say it now. But I might be exaggerating it, because I\u0027m feeling a loss. Maybe we\u0027re confusing a really good friendship for love, et cetera. You know the deal.",
        "Also, let\u0027s say we do have sex. It\u0027ll be a bigger deal for you. Not that I won\u0027t take it seriously. I have seriously thought about it. But it\u0027s a big responsibility to put on me, your first time, et cetera.",
        "Now who\u0027s babbling? Anyway, I think you\u0027re a wonderful person and friend, and the last thing I want to do is screw that up. Maybe we should just see, trial run, if making out agrees with us. You never know, we might decide it doesn\u0027t feel right and keep things status quo. Or we might end up getting it on every day.",

        "Letters from Bullwinkle. In 1983, at the Chicago International Film Festival, they had a tribute to Rocky and Bullwinkle. And I talked to Bill Scott and June Foray, who did the voices of Bullwinkle and Rocky, afterward. First, here\u0027s part of what they said at that event.",
        "How long did it take for you to develop the characterizations? Bill Scott-- About a minute and a half. No, as a matter of fact, the strange thing was, June got slickered into doing Rocky over a drunken martini lunch with Jay Ward. She would have agreed to anything. Can you do a flying squirrel? Oh sure, I can do a flying squirrel. I was a writer, and Jay Ward does not read. And the only way he knew what was in the script, was if I would read them to him.",
        "And I read him the voices on the way to the recording session, first one, right. And there\u0027s June, there\u0027s Paul Frees, Bill Conrad, all those wonderful people. And I said to him, who\u0027s going to read Bullwinkle? And he said, oh, I thought you were. And that\u0027s how much preparation I had for the part of Bullwinkle Moose.",
        "So afterward, I talked to them, asked them some more questions. And I got their autographs here on this ticket. It says, Hi-dee to old Dave from old Bullwinkle and Bill Scott, plus Rocky, Natasha, Nell, and June Foray. But anyway, afterward, I told Bill Scott I wanted to write a book about The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. And he said, get in line. I still have yet to see one, though.",
        "And then I told him I had a 78 RPM record of Rocky and Bullwinkle. It was a song called, \"I Was Born to be Airborne.\" He said, there is no such thing. This record, he said, didn\u0027t exist. But then I told him that I had taped all the shows off the air, off WGN. And I had them all on videotape. And he got excited, because he had never seen most of the shows in their original form. And he had me make copies for them. So Bullwinkle, Bill Scott, paid me to make videotapes, copies of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Shows for him.",
        "So we kept up a little bit of a correspondence. And I\u0027ll just read from some of these letters. Good luck with the taping. I look forward to seeing some of the shows that I\u0027ve never seen before. Here with another payment for your taping [? chores. ?] This stuff looks very good, although I am weary of the pull a rabbit out of my hat stuff. And I\u0027m depressed at how fast and skimpy the Mr. Know-It-Alls had to be done. But the other material is very fresh and funny to me.",
        "Some of it I even remember. Though I must say that the episode of Bumbling Brothers, when Conrad breaks up at the end, was a complete surprise. I thought it was hysterical. For god\u0027s sake, please record the Hoppitys. I\u0027ve never seen one of them. I wrote the Hoppity episodes, I think. Though I may have rewritten somebody else\u0027s stuff. Tell you better after I see them. I can usually recognize my own stuff. I also did the voice of Fillmore Bear, but I was in a period of relative modesty at the time, and was in favor of just taking one credit on a show, preferably the highest in the production hierarchy. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d do it again.",
        "And anyway, the upshot of it was, the taping project was never completed. Because shortly after receiving the fourth letter from him, Bill Scott had a heart attack and died at the age of 65. And so, while that may have been a sad thing, one thing that they did say at the festival was that-- somebody asked, why did they stop doing the show? And they said, well, you know, we had enough for syndication, but we could have gone on forever. And in syndication, they will."

Your earlier entry has been received and is being processed. And now, you\u0027ve been issued a specially coded, prize category tag. Break open your security pouch, Lucy Corcoran.",
        "Oh, I broke open the security pouch.",
        "Yes. It was affixed to the letter. I saved it just for this moment. This extra entry is guaranteed to make you one of Illinois\u0027 top prize winners of all time, with up to $11 million, if you have and return the winning prize claim number before August 9. If your tag is specially coded with the letter A--",
        "--it\u0027s coded with the letter A, you\u0027ll really want to hurry, Lucy Corcoran, because you stand to win $1 million, $75,000, or an unbelievable $11 million fortune.",
        "Here\u0027s another reason to act quickly. Over 8,000 winners from across the Prairie State have already claimed and been awarded their prizes, including Sparky Weiner of Chicago, Sparky Lawrence of Justice, Sparky Bailey of Chicago, and, category A winner, Sparky Peterson of Chicago.",
        "But time is running out, Lucy Corcoran. The exact prize you qualify for is hidden beneath the silver box on your prize category tag. So if you haven\u0027t yet scratched it off, we urge you to grab a lucky coin. I don\u0027t have one. I\u0027m scratching it off. Oh no. I\u0027m going to wish I had one. And do it now. And do so, now.",
        "If you uncover the code word, 11 mil-- and I did-- and your prize claim number is also the winner, we\u0027ll say, Lucy Corcoran is officially declared the biggest winner in Illinois history, and will be paid our first ever $11 million prize. You\u0027re second to none, Lucy Corcoran, in a league of your own with gigantic $366,666 prize checks pouring in, every year for 30 years, if you win. In the blink of an eye, you\u0027d be magically transformed into a fabulously rich multimillionaire, free from money worries ever more. Would you stay in Chicago, or custom build your dream home in another part of Illinois? Would you embark on a cruise around the world, or crisscross the country in a fully loaded motor home?",
        "It may sound like a dream to you now, but it will be your dream to bring to life if you have and return the winning prize number. So hold on to your dream, Lucy Corcoran, but don\u0027t hold on to this entry. Remember, you must reply before August 9 to advance to the winner selection step. Please, don\u0027t let anything stand in your way. Hurry. And then it\u0027s cordially signed by-- oh, there\u0027s more, but-- cordially signed by, Ed McMahon, or Ed \"Sparky\" Jones, and Sparky Clark for American Family Publishers. Thank you."

The pilot would sit in the back in regular clothes, and then he\u0027d wait till everyone got on, and wait about 15 minutes and say, damn it, where is that pilot? I\u0027m going to fly this thing myself. Go up in front, and all the passengers would be like freaking out.",

And we have a band called the Dysfunctionells that play here every two or three months. The cover of the letter is a psychedelic graphic that says the words, featuring dot, dot, dot, Dysfunctionells psychedelic? Just for the record, the Dysfunctionells are a very folk-based, Bluegrass, rocking band that I love. They\u0027re not psychedelic at all. But here\u0027s what it says.",
        "Regarding survival of the fittest. Dear fine club owner, psychedelic light shows. Remember Janice, Jimmy, Jerry, Timothy? What a long, strange trip it has been. Things change. Music certainly changes. Your club featured Dysfunctionells. You have to change to survive. The current issue of Illinois Entertainer features an article titled, \"The End of an Era,\" which describes the closing of what the magazine calls the Midwest\u0027s premiere hard rock, heavy metal club. The owner cites, quote unquote \"the sky high insurance premiums,\" as one of the contributing factors in his decision to close the doors permanently on the club. It goes on to talk about why he\u0027s underwriting this, financially strong, blah, blah, blah. And then he says, your phone number is 312-327-6666. Ours is 708, blank, blank, blank, 3790. One way or another, let\u0027s talk.",

        "Cool. I found this in the undergraduate library at the University of Illinois, in the computer lab. April 7, 1994. Dear Mr. V., hello, my name is Lois. I caught all three of your appearances on Jeopardy! and was greatly impressed. You are a brilliant, serious, dignified, modest, and beautiful young man. I was sorry to see your winning streak come to an end. Those categories on the last show were silly anyway. Roots, nursery rhyme, deli? Please.",
        "And when Alex teased you about Paris, romance, and cousins, my heart nearly melted. In case you\u0027re interested, I am an attractive 21 year old brunette studying economics and political science at the University of Illinois. And I love parrots and cats, too. If you\u0027d like, I could send you my picture. If not, have a wonderful life, and I hope to be a patient of yours some day. Au revoir. Sincerely-- and it leaves an address.",
        "The second one I found, it was posted on a bulletin board in the English building at the University of Illinois. Hello. My name is K. I am a 20 year old, single white male. I\u0027m about five foot six, brown hair, and have a mustache and beard. My grandmother\u0027s house is up for sale, and I really want it. I realize this is superficial, but I\u0027m seeking, preferably, a single white female, non-smoker, 18 to 35, wealthy slash gorgeous slash beautiful model-type woman for marriage. Or I want a quote unquote \"sugar mommy.\" A sugar daddy spoils young women, so I figure a sugar mommy spoils young men.",
        "Please send a photo. I am a junior and a history major. This realty company is selling my grandmother\u0027s house for $49,900. I lived in the house for 15 years with my grandmother. Below is a photo of the house and one of me. And he gives the realty\u0027s phone number. If you are not interested, then please pass this flyer to your female friends. I\u0027m very shy, so I haven\u0027t enclosed my phone number. And at the bottom it says, please hurry, time is running out."

        "Hiya hon\u0027, what are you up to? I\u0027m listening to Motley Crue, \"Shout at the Devil.\" That\u0027s a pretty kick-ass tape. It\u0027s Joe\u0027s, but it\u0027s still a kick-ass tape. And Vince Neil is such a fox. I\u0027d love to go backstage at a Crue concert. I\u0027d be in total heaven, because I know what I\u0027d do. And I\u0027ll bet you do too.",

And it\u0027s nothing I did. I don\u0027t act any different than before we did it. Are you trying to say that I\u0027m acting different, or I\u0027m slightly more insane than usual? Is that what you mean, I\u0027m acting differently? If that\u0027s what you mean, how?",

        "Know what mine and Tracy\u0027s new word is? [BLEEP]. That\u0027s right. For the last two days, we\u0027ve been calling every one [BLEEP]. Nice name, eh? Not as good as [BLEEP] or [BLEEP], but it\u0027s right up there.",
        "God is this note [BLEEP] dumb. It\u0027s 7:38. And I want it to be 8:38, because then I can listen to RPM, Real Precious Metal, 103.1, 831-1031-- kick-ass. \"Helter Skelter,\" you ain\u0027t maybe a lover, but you ain\u0027t no dancer, helter skelter.",

        "These are correspondence from a marriage between Sparky and Nadine. There\u0027s a poem in it, which I won\u0027t take up the whole time to read.",
        "Sparky, all the words, all the thank yous could never convey the depth and scope of my love and gratitude for you. May we forever uncover, unfold, our love, our passion, our joy, and laugh our way through this great adventure. I love you, Nadine. And that was written September 12, 1992.",
        "And this next letter is written from Sparky on December 24, 1993. Dear Nadine, I love you. I love you very, very much. This Christmas has brought me many gifts that I never knew existed before. I am learning about humility, patience, and trust. And most of all, I am learning about unconditional love. Excuse me. This year, I can\u0027t give you the material Christmas that I\u0027d like to, that you deserve. I can\u0027t even give you the card I bought for you, because I lost it. Instead I can give you some other stuff now and some material stuff later.",
        "First one, good for one really good body massage. Second one, good for one really good foot massage. The above two items may be redeemed any time and aren\u0027t really gifts, because you can have those anytime you want. Number three, good for one day of non-sarcasm. Redeem by 8:00 AM, day of use. And the fourth is good for one day of total slavery, any kind. Redeem with 24 hours advance notice to ensure proper scheduling. Merry Christmas, your love.",
        "And the last part of the correspondence. Dated January 12, 1996. To Nadine, in regard to the marriage of Sparky and Nadine. Dear Nadine, enclosed please find our proposed judgment of dissolution of marriage, for your review. Please advise me regarding changes and corrections. Sincerely, someone, an attorney."

        "All right, this is a letter that I received. It\u0027s addressed to me, so my name is Jenny Magnus. And on the envelope it says, lessons for advanced beginners. And then in the back, it says, burn after reading.",
        "Dear Ms. Magnus, I can imagine how easy it must be to discover what art is all about, and then use your facile capacity to steal symbols, ideas, quotes, et cetera and combine them in an enigmatic collage-type structure, making your work seem abstruse when, in fact, it is very conventional indeed.",
        "Holstein Park. I almost fell off my chair when, during one of your pieces, you imply that you are, quote \"a really good artist.\" After sitting there, listening to you chant, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, which you got from Janov\u0027s book, Primal Scream-- I shop through paperbacks at thrift stores too-- then hearing you chant, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, I sat there wondering just how conventional some pretentious chick dressed in black can be.",
        "I, by the way, use chick lightly, since you are not very feminine. In fact, you are nothing but a contrived, self deceiving, selfish, not overly bright, mediocre joke. You might be able to fool the poseurs who hang around Urbis Orbis flattering your brother, pretending to know, but not me, babe. Not me, babe.",
        "I use babe, lightly. You are not a babe. You have no sensuality, no charm, no looks, et cetera. Without affectation, without deliberately taking steps to appear avant, where would you be? Nothing comes naturally to you, does it? You really have to steal, and grub, and labor. In fact, you are perusing this letter for material right now, I bet.",
        "I realized how repressed and affected you are during Losers Alias. And thank God for the fire which started, or you\u0027d probably still be on the floor reciting your brother tripe. You are just too, too uptight, baby. You think you can act uninhibited. But why do you want to? Is it that important to you that you seem to yourself and others as if you are special? You are quite interesting. The only person with absolutely no substance I\u0027ve ever met. How did you get so [BLEEP]? Give up art-- you\u0027re no good at it anyway-- and save your [BLEEP] ass. Sincerely, Mason 32 degrees. PS. Well, I\u0027ve done my good deed for tonight."

        "I read this letter a little while ago, and I might have trouble reading it, because the handwriting is weird. It\u0027s from a friend of mine. He wrote to me, this was like seven or eight years ago. Well, no. When was the Gulf War? Five years ago. It was during the Gulf War, the first Gulf War, Bush\u0027s Gulf War. It was a guy I met in Morocco. And he was in the \u002768 student revolt in France, in Paris, actually, in Saint-Etienne. And the stationary is from the Hotel Adriatico, where he actually wasn\u0027t staying when he wrote the letter. He stole the paper.",
        "Dear Jeff, it\u0027s a joke. Today I went to the concert against the war. Many people-- thanks to Bush, Hussein, Mitterrand, and so-- all the old chaps went out from their quiet routines, and we met again, speaking and debating like in the \u002770s. Hee hee.",
        "Many young people here, many people here know, as a fact, that the voice of the TV is a weapon against their liberty of thinking. Since the war is the central point of the universal propaganda, the great lie of democracy is becoming obvious. Liberty is slavery. Democracy is dictative. Left is right. Everything is true as well as its contrary.",
        "Anyway, I have bought a house, an old one in a medieval village in the mountains, at five kilometers from the city. Many things to repair. So I am a dirty owner, one to be hung. I enjoy very much to make up the arrangements of a house without referring to anyone. My new address [MUMBLING]. I do not know if I shall go to the US soon, maybe so, maybe not. Did you receive my postcard from Morocco? The page is over. Ciao, Paul.",

        "Hi. I wrote-- can I hold this?",
        "I wrote these letters soon after I graduated from college. And I like to turn back to them, every now and then, to remind myself what an idiot I was. I believed at the time that I could get any job I wanted, anywhere, at any point. And these letters, I think, are indicative. Here\u0027s one I wrote to Tina Brown, who was then the editor of Vanity Fair magazine.",
        "Dear Ms. Brown, I\u0027ll cut to the quick. I would like to work for The New Yorker. And I imagine with the big change-over, you may need lots of editorial help. So I\u0027m throwing my hat into the ring, and asking you to consider hiring me as an editorial assistant for your new project.",
        "I\u0027ve been precociously reading The New Yorker for some time now. And I am a devotee of the current magazine, as well as of its historical heritage. Most of the writers I respect most, living and dead, have written for your magazine at some time. I\u0027m willing to cut my journalistic and literary teeth elsewhere, if can\u0027t get a job at The New Yorker, but I\u0027m determined not to end up anywhere else.",
        "The resume I\u0027ve enclosed doesn\u0027t indicate this, but I\u0027ve been working as a freelance writer since graduating two months ago. I\u0027ve been doing pretty well, but I\u0027m still waiting for the big score. Maybe you could help. I strongly encourage you to take a chance on me, but if I don\u0027t suit your needs at this time, thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "About six months later, I hadn\u0027t yet heard from Tina Brown so I turned my gaze elsewhere. Here\u0027s one I wrote to Strobe Talbott, who, at the time, was an editor-at-large at Time magazine, and now, as you may or may not know, is a Deputy Secretary of State in the Clinton administration. So here\u0027s what I wrote to Strobe.",
        "Dear Mr. Talbott, I\u0027m a damn good editor. I\u0027m young and gutsy, as a marine in combat. My terse, tough prose style would make Raymond Chandler weep. Somewhere, somehow, the grapevine told me that you\u0027re starting a magazine called, Globe Review. Said vine also let me know that the staff will be small, which means you\u0027re not hiring too many people. Being low man on the totem pole is fine with me.",
        "Your magazine sounds original, smart, and progressive, sophisticated but not shallow. Of course, I\u0027m just guessing. Can you go global without me? I think so. Should you? I think not. Or at least hope not. I\u0027ll do good work as an assistant editor, copy editor, or researcher. I\u0027ll be in New York City from November 11 through 17. If you\u0027d like to interview me, you can contact me at the Chicago address on my resume until then. Thank you for reviewing my application. And I look forward to seeing the magazine, whether I am part of it or not."

I think it won\u0027t really need any other introduction except that, where the letter writer refers to Vienna, I think it\u0027s safe to assume that that\u0027s not Austria. OK. Time, 10:00 PM. June 10, \u002796. Dear Carla, what\u0027s up babe? How are you doing? Fine, I hope. Well, I\u0027m in Vienna. But I didn\u0027t forget to write. Baby, I miss you. I can\u0027t wait to see you. I\u0027ve been thinking about you all the time, and I can\u0027t stop. I got into a fight in here with a king, and for that, I got two weeks in the hole.",
        "Baby, I hope you\u0027re not talking to someone else. I\u0027ve been waiting for your letters, but I haven\u0027t received any yet. What\u0027s up with that? Carla, I feel that you don\u0027t love me anymore. Baby, I love you more than what you could ever know. I miss making love to you, kissing you. Please, send me some pictures of you. When I get out of here, I\u0027m going to get a job. I\u0027ll even quit gang banging if you show me you love me.",
        "Carla, what do you mean when you say, you went from 100% to 50%? I don\u0027t understand. I haven\u0027t been cheating on you. And I\u0027ll be with you all the time when I get out. Carla, I care about you a lot. You just don\u0027t know. Why is your mom going to kick you out? What have you done? Please, don\u0027t lie to me. Are you [BLEEP] around with someone else? Staying out late? What is it? I\u0027ve got the feeling you are seeing someone else, but I guess I can\u0027t trip, so long as when I get out, you come back to me.",

Whatever you do, wherever you go, you\u0027ll always be in my heart, Carla. Believe that. I know you think I don\u0027t love you anymore, but you\u0027re wrong, babe. I said it before, and I\u0027ll say it again. I love you, Carla."

        "I collect letters. These first three are ones that I found in a dumpster on Roosevelt Street. First one\u0027s July 6, 1982. Dear friends and well wishers, due to the circumstances beyond our control, the wedding which was scheduled for July 24, 1982 has been canceled. Sorry if this has inconvenienced you in the way. Respectfully, D and R.",
        "The second is from the City of Chicago Department of Police. Dear Mr. R., since the registration of your complaint, investigation has been made concerning possible misconduct by a member of our department. A complete record of the complaint and investigation is now part of our file and will be used in planning, training, and updating equipment in our continuing effort to better provide service and protection to the public. We share your concern relative to the conduct of our members and appreciate your bringing this matter to our attention.",
        "Although evidence in this case failed to justify the taking of disciplinary action against the accused member, the department as a whole has benefited by having taken a closer look at the performance of our member. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.",
        "The third is a letter that has his apartment number written on the back, so it was obviously just dropped off at the building. Oh, it\u0027s 9/15/1984. Hey R., thank you very much for being there when I needed you last night. Rejection must be your number one priority. You have done it once more again.",
        "You told me to give my mother her keys back and come to your place a few weeks ago. And I told you, when I was ready to move in, I would. And I would let you know. I wasn\u0027t asking to move in. I was asking for a place to stay for the night. I spent last weekend down there. But this weekend and I\u0027m not qualified. If you don\u0027t want me in your apartment anymore, then you should say so. I understand our situation, but I do have props. I am the first lady you\u0027ve dealt with to become Mrs. R., therefore, I am special in your life. You may not want to admit it, but it\u0027s true.",
        "It\u0027s obvious that you are seeing somebody else, in which you are entitled. But I should have top priority. Nevertheless, I hope you and your lady that\u0027s expecting your child to be very happy. Don\u0027t worry about me and my pregnancy. I\u0027ll be just fine. I don\u0027t want to come in between anyone\u0027s happy affair. You must have let our secret out about the divorce to her, in order for you to be so comfortable to have sex with her. I thought we agreed years ago that we would remain sex partners, if nothing else. However it be, I hope your wish comes true.",
        "You are totally responsible for my unhappiness, depression, and confused state of mind that I am in. You are always doing the same thing over, and over, and over. Will you ever change? For someone to have been in love-- and still is, per you-- you sure treat the party you\u0027re supposed to be in love with cruel. As often as I\u0027ve been through the same ordeal with you, I don\u0027t know why I continue to allow myself to be hurt by you. I am often hurt by the things you say to me, and your actions or ways towards me.",
        "You are my life, friend, enemy, joy, sorrow, husband, lover, and that has been taken away from me. I have not got over the shocking news of us being divorced. Being with someone for nine years is not easy to brush under the rug. You try telling yourself that it\u0027s over, and it doesn\u0027t work. I am trying to be friends with you if nothing else.",
        "And it goes on and on about that for a while. And then the end is--",
        "I love you now and always will. You will be number one in my life, whether we\u0027re together or not. If ever you need me, just send for me, and I\u0027m just a phone call away. Love, D. PS, inform me if you have a boy, a girl, or twins, and I will do the same."

        "There was a speaker-- yes, a speaker-- at a podium, and the assembled masses applauded him, not understanding that it is not barbecue\u0027s purpose to enlighten participants upon matters of fact or scientific knowledge. But that barbecue is inherently enlightening into matters of a more ontological nature. And there were waiters and waitresses roaming the room, serving food, for the gathered horde did not understand proper methodology of a barbecue. At these sights I fled, for I had seen enough evils, and their mere presence was nearly overpowering.",
        "My message is not one of vilification or condemnation, but rather one of information, one seeking to create awareness of what true barbecue is in its virtually boundless possibilities to create things. Albeit mostly immaterial of a whole and good nature.",
        "It is my heartfelt hope that future barbecuers will at least recognize these possibilities, and consider the ways of true barbecue through which they are achieved. For barbecue provides a light, a beacon of good for mankind. And without proper respect for and methods of true barbecue, this knowledge will be lost, and the future of mankind will be muddled and uncertain. God bless you, and God bless barbecue.",
        "This is email. This guy, this is kind of a stream of consciousness thing. He\u0027s writing it from school. He\u0027s in the computer lab. And the only thing I want to mention, he keeps referring to the cluster. And that\u0027s what he\u0027s referring to, the computer lab with all the things around. You\u0027ll find out what he\u0027s upset about at the end. I\u0027m going to start in the middle.",
        "There is this guy sitting across the row of computers from me that has his left ear pierced many, many times. I\u0027m trying to count. There are at least five metal rings going through his ear. I\u0027m trying not to be too obvious looking at him. Yeah, it looks like five or six, at least, all up and down his ear.",
        "You do see some interesting ones in these clusters, that\u0027s for sure. Then there is this one guy, Sparky. I don\u0027t think I have ever been in this cluster, and he wasn\u0027t here or didn\u0027t stop in for a minute. Same thing for this other girl, KGB Slut, as we call her. She\u0027s always here too. Shooter is here most of the times I am too. OK, some girl just came in who was wearing what, essentially, looks to me like a rug or a piece of carpet with some holes cut in it. She\u0027s gone now.",
        "Who else is always in this cluster? Hm, I just realized, I probably shouldn\u0027t talk about KGB Slut girl, since she\u0027ll probably see this sooner or later, or something. Ah, who cares. What\u0027s she going to do, get the geek patrol after me or something? Oh yeah, the other day I was in here, and she had the audacity to talk about my Ronald Reagan screensaver.",
        "Yeah, it definitely looks like a rug, a Mexican or southwestern type, by its colors, I guess. And it\u0027s got little rug-string things at its edges. It does kind of have a collar. Just a few short minutes ago, I walked over to the faculty dining room in Skibo. There was a physics department barbecue that was supposed to be going on. I wasn\u0027t sure if I should go. I mean, it\u0027s free food, and that can be hard to pass up. Plus, if it\u0027s a real barbecue, it\u0027ll be free beef, real food, for real people, what\u0027s for dinner, my favorite food.",
        "I was extremely disheartened by what I saw, by what these people call a barbecue. Here is my image of what a barbecue is. A bunch of people outside, standing or sitting around, beers in hand, talking informally with one another. The sizzle of meat on the grill, and the sweet smell of cooking beef fill the air, and everyone is happy and jolly, and life seems so much easier.",
        "The barbecue is sort of a tonic for the [? dour ?] of everyday life, a reminder of a sort of greater purpose than 40 hours of work a week. And yet, barbecue is not just a reminder of that purpose, but, in many ways, is that purpose. For barbecue is one of the great binding elements of the universe. That sort of metaphysical playdough that maybe can be shaped and molded but not defined.",
        "And seeing where I come from, you can understand my shock and horror at what I saw being called a barbecue this evening in the faculty dining room. Oh, I did not stay for long, no. In the scant few seconds that I did venture into this room, what I did see scared me mightily. And I did not care to see more. So this information I bring you now is likely not even complete, not a full accounting of the barbecue perversions that occurred within.",
        "I saw people seated at tables, many tables, which were organized in a regular, orderly fashion. These people were not conversing amongst themselves, not mingling, not understanding the sweet bliss that is true barbecue."

They are not worried about what the editor is going to say. They\u0027re not worried about, a lot of times, sounding dumb. And consequently, they\u0027re much freer with their expression, both stylistically and in terms of what they\u0027re willing to talk about.",

But if he\u0027s going to a poetry reading, most likely he won\u0027t read about barbecue. He\u0027ll probably read a poem about apartheid or something like that, something politically important. And they are very unpredictable. And it\u0027s just--",

            "My letter is written on the back of a CBGB\u0027s flyer from New York, from a guy that I met while I was in Paris. He was cycling through Europe. Dear Kara, Hey, I haven\u0027t written to you in a long time. I had been in the midst of a personal and emotional whirlwind. Whoosh, and the wind went rushing through my brain and into my body chemistry. And God spoke to me and said, get a grip, dude. Whereas you\u0027ve been sitting at work wishing you were on vacation, I\u0027ve been sitting in my parents\u0027 house and on the couches of several friends wishing that I had work to do. Without the stable base of my own place, it was indeed difficult to focus on anything. Socializing? Yes. Continued cycling around? Yes. Work? Absolutely no.",
            "Right now, as I write to you, I am glowing like a pregnant woman. After several weeks of trying to get in this film production company, playing my cards and doing spot jobs for the dude who runs it-- who is our age, is the son of a Time-Warner Company huge corporate executive, has access to the mass media, as well as access to, no kidding, millions of dollars-- I\u0027ve emerged with, yes, a job. How fortunate for me and my wonderful temperament and abilities. He needs me to save his project, to co-rewrite the story, as well as edit the thing, a short 30 minute film-poem on the Hudson Valley of Upstate New York.",
            "He is letting me put my whole lower leg in the door, never mind my foot. I am excited and ready to begin work. I am going to do a great job for him. So now, I am slightly more sane, more filled with better cheer, and open to a little sharing and communication with several individuals. It is a pleasure to correspond with you. It was certainly a pleasure to hang out in Paris. Hoping to hear from you soon. Why not send along some writing samples, so that we may begin to fully share our literary interests and creations? Love and kisses, Sparky. PS, thank you so much for the photos. I look pretty good. I\u0027m shocked."

You see, how can I ever think of hurting you like that? Let\u0027s say something starts between us. What about S? I may not like him, but maybe I do. Also, what if I\u0027m just on the rebound from Dave? Not that I didn\u0027t like you before. Maybe I\u0027m just free to say it now. But I might be exaggerating it, because I\u0027m feeling a loss. Maybe we\u0027re confusing a really good friendship for love, et cetera. You know the deal.",

            "Letters from Bullwinkle. In 1983, at the Chicago International Film Festival, they had a tribute to Rocky and Bullwinkle. And I talked to Bill Scott and June Foray, who did the voices of Bullwinkle and Rocky, afterward. First, here\u0027s part of what they said at that event.",
            "How long did it take for you to develop the characterizations? Bill Scott-- About a minute and a half. No, as a matter of fact, the strange thing was, June got slickered into doing Rocky over a drunken martini lunch with Jay Ward. She would have agreed to anything. Can you do a flying squirrel? Oh sure, I can do a flying squirrel. I was a writer, and Jay Ward does not read. And the only way he knew what was in the script, was if I would read them to him.",
            "And I read him the voices on the way to the recording session, first one, right. And there\u0027s June, there\u0027s Paul Frees, Bill Conrad, all those wonderful people. And I said to him, who\u0027s going to read Bullwinkle? And he said, oh, I thought you were. And that\u0027s how much preparation I had for the part of Bullwinkle Moose.",
            "So afterward, I talked to them, asked them some more questions. And I got their autographs here on this ticket. It says, Hi-dee to old Dave from old Bullwinkle and Bill Scott, plus Rocky, Natasha, Nell, and June Foray. But anyway, afterward, I told Bill Scott I wanted to write a book about The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. And he said, get in line. I still have yet to see one, though.",
            "And then I told him I had a 78 RPM record of Rocky and Bullwinkle. It was a song called, \"I Was Born to be Airborne.\" He said, there is no such thing. This record, he said, didn\u0027t exist. But then I told him that I had taped all the shows off the air, off WGN. And I had them all on videotape. And he got excited, because he had never seen most of the shows in their original form. And he had me make copies for them. So Bullwinkle, Bill Scott, paid me to make videotapes, copies of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Shows for him.",
            "So we kept up a little bit of a correspondence. And I\u0027ll just read from some of these letters. Good luck with the taping. I look forward to seeing some of the shows that I\u0027ve never seen before. Here with another payment for your taping [? chores. ?] This stuff looks very good, although I am weary of the pull a rabbit out of my hat stuff. And I\u0027m depressed at how fast and skimpy the Mr. Know-It-Alls had to be done. But the other material is very fresh and funny to me.",
            "Some of it I even remember. Though I must say that the episode of Bumbling Brothers, when Conrad breaks up at the end, was a complete surprise. I thought it was hysterical. For god\u0027s sake, please record the Hoppitys. I\u0027ve never seen one of them. I wrote the Hoppity episodes, I think. Though I may have rewritten somebody else\u0027s stuff. Tell you better after I see them. I can usually recognize my own stuff. I also did the voice of Fillmore Bear, but I was in a period of relative modesty at the time, and was in favor of just taking one credit on a show, preferably the highest in the production hierarchy. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d do it again.",
            "And anyway, the upshot of it was, the taping project was never completed. Because shortly after receiving the fourth letter from him, Bill Scott had a heart attack and died at the age of 65. And so, while that may have been a sad thing, one thing that they did say at the festival was that-- somebody asked, why did they stop doing the show? And they said, well, you know, we had enough for syndication, but we could have gone on forever. And in syndication, they will."

You\u0027re Illinois\u0027 top winner, guaranteed a full $11 million. Your earlier entry has been received and is being processed. And now, you\u0027ve been issued a specially coded, prize category tag. Break open your security pouch, Lucy Corcoran.",
            "Oh, I broke open the security pouch.",
            "Yes. It was affixed to the letter. I saved it just for this moment. This extra entry is guaranteed to make you one of Illinois\u0027 top prize winners of all time, with up to $11 million, if you have and return the winning prize claim number before August 9. If your tag is specially coded with the letter A--",
            "--it\u0027s coded with the letter A, you\u0027ll really want to hurry, Lucy Corcoran, because you stand to win $1 million, $75,000, or an unbelievable $11 million fortune.",
            "Here\u0027s another reason to act quickly. Over 8,000 winners from across the Prairie State have already claimed and been awarded their prizes, including Sparky Weiner of Chicago, Sparky Lawrence of Justice, Sparky Bailey of Chicago, and, category A winner, Sparky Peterson of Chicago.",
            "But time is running out, Lucy Corcoran. The exact prize you qualify for is hidden beneath the silver box on your prize category tag. So if you haven\u0027t yet scratched it off, we urge you to grab a lucky coin. I don\u0027t have one. I\u0027m scratching it off. Oh no. I\u0027m going to wish I had one. And do it now. And do so, now.",
            "If you uncover the code word, 11 mil-- and I did-- and your prize claim number is also the winner, we\u0027ll say, Lucy Corcoran is officially declared the biggest winner in Illinois history, and will be paid our first ever $11 million prize. You\u0027re second to none, Lucy Corcoran, in a league of your own with gigantic $366,666 prize checks pouring in, every year for 30 years, if you win. In the blink of an eye, you\u0027d be magically transformed into a fabulously rich multimillionaire, free from money worries ever more. Would you stay in Chicago, or custom build your dream home in another part of Illinois? Would you embark on a cruise around the world, or crisscross the country in a fully loaded motor home?",
            "It may sound like a dream to you now, but it will be your dream to bring to life if you have and return the winning prize number. So hold on to your dream, Lucy Corcoran, but don\u0027t hold on to this entry. Remember, you must reply before August 9 to advance to the winner selection step. Please, don\u0027t let anything stand in your way. Hurry. And then it\u0027s cordially signed by-- oh, there\u0027s more, but-- cordially signed by, Ed McMahon, or Ed \"Sparky\" Jones, and Sparky Clark for American Family Publishers. Thank you."

And we have a band called the Dysfunctionells that play here every two or three months. The cover of the letter is a psychedelic graphic that says the words, featuring dot, dot, dot, Dysfunctionells psychedelic? Just for the record, the Dysfunctionells are a very folk-based, Bluegrass, rocking band that I love. They\u0027re not psychedelic at all. But here\u0027s what it says.",

Music certainly changes. Your club featured Dysfunctionells. You have to change to survive. The current issue of Illinois Entertainer features an article titled, \"The End of an Era,\" which describes the closing of what the magazine calls the Midwest\u0027s premiere hard rock, heavy metal club. The owner cites, quote unquote \"the sky high insurance premiums,\" as one of the contributing factors in his decision to close the doors permanently on the club. It goes on to talk about why he\u0027s underwriting this, financially strong, blah, blah, blah. And then he says, your phone number is 312-327-6666. Ours is 708, blank, blank, blank, 3790. One way or another, let\u0027s talk.",

I caught all three of your appearances on Jeopardy! and was greatly impressed. You are a brilliant, serious, dignified, modest, and beautiful young man. I was sorry to see your winning streak come to an end. Those categories on the last show were silly anyway. Roots, nursery rhyme, deli? Please.",

In case you\u0027re interested, I am an attractive 21 year old brunette studying economics and political science at the University of Illinois. And I love parrots and cats, too. If you\u0027d like, I could send you my picture. If not, have a wonderful life, and I hope to be a patient of yours some day. Au revoir. Sincerely-- and it leaves an address.",

I\u0027m about five foot six, brown hair, and have a mustache and beard. My grandmother\u0027s house is up for sale, and I really want it. I realize this is superficial, but I\u0027m seeking, preferably, a single white female, non-smoker, 18 to 35, wealthy slash gorgeous slash beautiful model-type woman for marriage. Or I want a quote unquote \"sugar mommy.\" A sugar daddy spoils young women, so I figure a sugar mommy spoils young men.",

Below is a photo of the house and one of me. And he gives the realty\u0027s phone number. If you are not interested, then please pass this flyer to your female friends. I\u0027m very shy, so I haven\u0027t enclosed my phone number. And at the bottom it says, please hurry, time is running out."

            "Sparky, all the words, all the thank yous could never convey the depth and scope of my love and gratitude for you. May we forever uncover, unfold, our love, our passion, our joy, and laugh our way through this great adventure. I love you, Nadine. And that was written September 12, 1992.",
            "And this next letter is written from Sparky on December 24, 1993. Dear Nadine, I love you. I love you very, very much. This Christmas has brought me many gifts that I never knew existed before. I am learning about humility, patience, and trust. And most of all, I am learning about unconditional love. Excuse me. This year, I can\u0027t give you the material Christmas that I\u0027d like to, that you deserve. I can\u0027t even give you the card I bought for you, because I lost it. Instead I can give you some other stuff now and some material stuff later.",
            "First one, good for one really good body massage. Second one, good for one really good foot massage. The above two items may be redeemed any time and aren\u0027t really gifts, because you can have those anytime you want. Number three, good for one day of non-sarcasm. Redeem by 8:00 AM, day of use. And the fourth is good for one day of total slavery, any kind. Redeem with 24 hours advance notice to ensure proper scheduling. Merry Christmas, your love.",
            "And the last part of the correspondence. Dated January 12, 1996. To Nadine, in regard to the marriage of Sparky and Nadine. Dear Nadine, enclosed please find our proposed judgment of dissolution of marriage, for your review. Please advise me regarding changes and corrections. Sincerely, someone, an attorney."

            "All right, this is a letter that I received. It\u0027s addressed to me, so my name is Jenny Magnus. And on the envelope it says, lessons for advanced beginners. And then in the back, it says, burn after reading.",
            "Dear Ms. Magnus, I can imagine how easy it must be to discover what art is all about, and then use your facile capacity to steal symbols, ideas, quotes, et cetera and combine them in an enigmatic collage-type structure, making your work seem abstruse when, in fact, it is very conventional indeed.",
            "Holstein Park. I almost fell off my chair when, during one of your pieces, you imply that you are, quote \"a really good artist.\" After sitting there, listening to you chant, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, which you got from Janov\u0027s book, Primal Scream-- I shop through paperbacks at thrift stores too-- then hearing you chant, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, I sat there wondering just how conventional some pretentious chick dressed in black can be.",
            "I, by the way, use chick lightly, since you are not very feminine. In fact, you are nothing but a contrived, self deceiving, selfish, not overly bright, mediocre joke. You might be able to fool the poseurs who hang around Urbis Orbis flattering your brother, pretending to know, but not me, babe. Not me, babe.",
            "I use babe, lightly. You are not a babe. You have no sensuality, no charm, no looks, et cetera. Without affectation, without deliberately taking steps to appear avant, where would you be? Nothing comes naturally to you, does it? You really have to steal, and grub, and labor. In fact, you are perusing this letter for material right now, I bet.",
            "I realized how repressed and affected you are during Losers Alias. And thank God for the fire which started, or you\u0027d probably still be on the floor reciting your brother tripe. You are just too, too uptight, baby. You think you can act uninhibited. But why do you want to? Is it that important to you that you seem to yourself and others as if you are special? You are quite interesting. The only person with absolutely no substance I\u0027ve ever met. How did you get so [BLEEP]? Give up art-- you\u0027re no good at it anyway-- and save your [BLEEP] ass. Sincerely, Mason 32 degrees. PS. Well, I\u0027ve done my good deed for tonight."

            "I read this letter a little while ago, and I might have trouble reading it, because the handwriting is weird. It\u0027s from a friend of mine. He wrote to me, this was like seven or eight years ago. Well, no. When was the Gulf War? Five years ago. It was during the Gulf War, the first Gulf War, Bush\u0027s Gulf War. It was a guy I met in Morocco. And he was in the \u002768 student revolt in France, in Paris, actually, in Saint-Etienne. And the stationary is from the Hotel Adriatico, where he actually wasn\u0027t staying when he wrote the letter. He stole the paper.",
            "Dear Jeff, it\u0027s a joke. Today I went to the concert against the war. Many people-- thanks to Bush, Hussein, Mitterrand, and so-- all the old chaps went out from their quiet routines, and we met again, speaking and debating like in the \u002770s. Hee hee.",
            "Many young people here, many people here know, as a fact, that the voice of the TV is a weapon against their liberty of thinking. Since the war is the central point of the universal propaganda, the great lie of democracy is becoming obvious. Liberty is slavery. Democracy is dictative. Left is right. Everything is true as well as its contrary.",
            "Anyway, I have bought a house, an old one in a medieval village in the mountains, at five kilometers from the city. Many things to repair. So I am a dirty owner, one to be hung. I enjoy very much to make up the arrangements of a house without referring to anyone. My new address [MUMBLING]. I do not know if I shall go to the US soon, maybe so, maybe not. Did you receive my postcard from Morocco? The page is over. Ciao, Paul.",

            "Hi. I wrote-- can I hold this?",
            "I wrote these letters soon after I graduated from college. And I like to turn back to them, every now and then, to remind myself what an idiot I was. I believed at the time that I could get any job I wanted, anywhere, at any point. And these letters, I think, are indicative. Here\u0027s one I wrote to Tina Brown, who was then the editor of Vanity Fair magazine.",
            "Dear Ms. Brown, I\u0027ll cut to the quick. I would like to work for The New Yorker. And I imagine with the big change-over, you may need lots of editorial help. So I\u0027m throwing my hat into the ring, and asking you to consider hiring me as an editorial assistant for your new project.",
            "I\u0027ve been precociously reading The New Yorker for some time now. And I am a devotee of the current magazine, as well as of its historical heritage. Most of the writers I respect most, living and dead, have written for your magazine at some time. I\u0027m willing to cut my journalistic and literary teeth elsewhere, if can\u0027t get a job at The New Yorker, but I\u0027m determined not to end up anywhere else.",
            "The resume I\u0027ve enclosed doesn\u0027t indicate this, but I\u0027ve been working as a freelance writer since graduating two months ago. I\u0027ve been doing pretty well, but I\u0027m still waiting for the big score. Maybe you could help. I strongly encourage you to take a chance on me, but if I don\u0027t suit your needs at this time, thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to hearing from you.",
            "About six months later, I hadn\u0027t yet heard from Tina Brown so I turned my gaze elsewhere. Here\u0027s one I wrote to Strobe Talbott, who, at the time, was an editor-at-large at Time magazine, and now, as you may or may not know, is a Deputy Secretary of State in the Clinton administration. So here\u0027s what I wrote to Strobe.",
            "Dear Mr. Talbott, I\u0027m a damn good editor. I\u0027m young and gutsy, as a marine in combat. My terse, tough prose style would make Raymond Chandler weep. Somewhere, somehow, the grapevine told me that you\u0027re starting a magazine called, Globe Review. Said vine also let me know that the staff will be small, which means you\u0027re not hiring too many people. Being low man on the totem pole is fine with me.",
            "Your magazine sounds original, smart, and progressive, sophisticated but not shallow. Of course, I\u0027m just guessing. Can you go global without me? I think so. Should you? I think not. Or at least hope not. I\u0027ll do good work as an assistant editor, copy editor, or researcher. I\u0027ll be in New York City from November 11 through 17. If you\u0027d like to interview me, you can contact me at the Chicago address on my resume until then. Thank you for reviewing my application. And I look forward to seeing the magazine, whether I am part of it or not."

I think it won\u0027t really need any other introduction except that, where the letter writer refers to Vienna, I think it\u0027s safe to assume that that\u0027s not Austria. OK. Time, 10:00 PM. June 10, \u002796. Dear Carla, what\u0027s up babe? How are you doing? Fine, I hope. Well, I\u0027m in Vienna. But I didn\u0027t forget to write. Baby, I miss you. I can\u0027t wait to see you. I\u0027ve been thinking about you all the time, and I can\u0027t stop. I got into a fight in here with a king, and for that, I got two weeks in the hole.",

Carla, I feel that you don\u0027t love me anymore. Baby, I love you more than what you could ever know. I miss making love to you, kissing you. Please, send me some pictures of you. When I get out of here, I\u0027m going to get a job. I\u0027ll even quit gang banging if you show me you love me.",

Carla, I care about you a lot. You just don\u0027t know. Why is your mom going to kick you out? What have you done? Please, don\u0027t lie to me. Are you [BLEEP] around with someone else? Staying out late? What is it? I\u0027ve got the feeling you are seeing someone else, but I guess I can\u0027t trip, so long as when I get out, you come back to me.",

Whatever you do, wherever you go, you\u0027ll always be in my heart, Carla. Believe that. I know you think I don\u0027t love you anymore, but you\u0027re wrong, babe. I said it before, and I\u0027ll say it again. I love you, Carla."

Dear friends and well wishers, due to the circumstances beyond our control, the wedding which was scheduled for July 24, 1982 has been canceled. Sorry if this has inconvenienced you in the way. Respectfully, D and R.",

Dear Mr. R., since the registration of your complaint, investigation has been made concerning possible misconduct by a member of our department. A complete record of the complaint and investigation is now part of our file and will be used in planning, training, and updating equipment in our continuing effort to better provide service and protection to the public. We share your concern relative to the conduct of our members and appreciate your bringing this matter to our attention.",

Hey R., thank you very much for being there when I needed you last night. Rejection must be your number one priority. You have done it once more again.",

I wasn\u0027t asking to move in. I was asking for a place to stay for the night. I spent last weekend down there. But this weekend and I\u0027m not qualified. If you don\u0027t want me in your apartment anymore, then you should say so. I understand our situation, but I do have props. I am the first lady you\u0027ve dealt with to become Mrs. R., therefore, I am special in your life. You may not want to admit it, but it\u0027s true.",
            "It\u0027s obvious that you are seeing somebody else, in which you are entitled. But I should have top priority. Nevertheless, I hope you and your lady that\u0027s expecting your child to be very happy. Don\u0027t worry about me and my pregnancy. I\u0027ll be just fine. I don\u0027t want to come in between anyone\u0027s happy affair. You must have let our secret out about the divorce to her, in order for you to be so comfortable to have sex with her. I thought we agreed years ago that we would remain sex partners, if nothing else. However it be, I hope your wish comes true.",
            "You are totally responsible for my unhappiness, depression, and confused state of mind that I am in. You are always doing the same thing over, and over, and over. Will you ever change? For someone to have been in love-- and still is, per you-- you sure treat the party you\u0027re supposed to be in love with cruel. As often as I\u0027ve been through the same ordeal with you, I don\u0027t know why I continue to allow myself to be hurt by you. I am often hurt by the things you say to me, and your actions or ways towards me.",

Being with someone for nine years is not easy to brush under the rug. You try telling yourself that it\u0027s over, and it doesn\u0027t work. I am trying to be friends with you if nothing else.",

            "There was a speaker-- yes, a speaker-- at a podium, and the assembled masses applauded him, not understanding that it is not barbecue\u0027s purpose to enlighten participants upon matters of fact or scientific knowledge. But that barbecue is inherently enlightening into matters of a more ontological nature. And there were waiters and waitresses roaming the room, serving food, for the gathered horde did not understand proper methodology of a barbecue. At these sights I fled, for I had seen enough evils, and their mere presence was nearly overpowering.",
            "My message is not one of vilification or condemnation, but rather one of information, one seeking to create awareness of what true barbecue is in its virtually boundless possibilities to create things. Albeit mostly immaterial of a whole and good nature.",
            "It is my heartfelt hope that future barbecuers will at least recognize these possibilities, and consider the ways of true barbecue through which they are achieved. For barbecue provides a light, a beacon of good for mankind. And without proper respect for and methods of true barbecue, this knowledge will be lost, and the future of mankind will be muddled and uncertain. God bless you, and God bless barbecue.",
            "This is email. This guy, this is kind of a stream of consciousness thing. He\u0027s writing it from school. He\u0027s in the computer lab. And the only thing I want to mention, he keeps referring to the cluster. And that\u0027s what he\u0027s referring to, the computer lab with all the things around. You\u0027ll find out what he\u0027s upset about at the end. I\u0027m going to start in the middle.",
            "There is this guy sitting across the row of computers from me that has his left ear pierced many, many times. I\u0027m trying to count. There are at least five metal rings going through his ear. I\u0027m trying not to be too obvious looking at him. Yeah, it looks like five or six, at least, all up and down his ear.",
            "You do see some interesting ones in these clusters, that\u0027s for sure. Then there is this one guy, Sparky. I don\u0027t think I have ever been in this cluster, and he wasn\u0027t here or didn\u0027t stop in for a minute. Same thing for this other girl, KGB Slut, as we call her. She\u0027s always here too. Shooter is here most of the times I am too. OK, some girl just came in who was wearing what, essentially, looks to me like a rug or a piece of carpet with some holes cut in it. She\u0027s gone now.",
            "Who else is always in this cluster? Hm, I just realized, I probably shouldn\u0027t talk about KGB Slut girl, since she\u0027ll probably see this sooner or later, or something. Ah, who cares. What\u0027s she going to do, get the geek patrol after me or something? Oh yeah, the other day I was in here, and she had the audacity to talk about my Ronald Reagan screensaver.",
            "Yeah, it definitely looks like a rug, a Mexican or southwestern type, by its colors, I guess. And it\u0027s got little rug-string things at its edges. It does kind of have a collar. Just a few short minutes ago, I walked over to the faculty dining room in Skibo. There was a physics department barbecue that was supposed to be going on. I wasn\u0027t sure if I should go. I mean, it\u0027s free food, and that can be hard to pass up. Plus, if it\u0027s a real barbecue, it\u0027ll be free beef, real food, for real people, what\u0027s for dinner, my favorite food.",
            "I was extremely disheartened by what I saw, by what these people call a barbecue. Here is my image of what a barbecue is. A bunch of people outside, standing or sitting around, beers in hand, talking informally with one another. The sizzle of meat on the grill, and the sweet smell of cooking beef fill the air, and everyone is happy and jolly, and life seems so much easier.",
            "The barbecue is sort of a tonic for the [? dour ?] of everyday life, a reminder of a sort of greater purpose than 40 hours of work a week. And yet, barbecue is not just a reminder of that purpose, but, in many ways, is that purpose. For barbecue is one of the great binding elements of the universe. That sort of metaphysical playdough that maybe can be shaped and molded but not defined.",
            "And seeing where I come from, you can understand my shock and horror at what I saw being called a barbecue this evening in the faculty dining room. Oh, I did not stay for long, no. In the scant few seconds that I did venture into this room, what I did see scared me mightily. And I did not care to see more. So this information I bring you now is likely not even complete, not a full accounting of the barbecue perversions that occurred within.",
            "I saw people seated at tables, many tables, which were organized in a regular, orderly fashion. These people were not conversing amongst themselves, not mingling, not understanding the sweet bliss that is true barbecue."

Dear Kara, Hey, I haven\u0027t written to you in a long time. I had been in the midst of a personal and emotional whirlwind. Whoosh, and the wind went rushing through my brain and into my body chemistry. And God spoke to me and said, get a grip, dude. Whereas you\u0027ve been sitting at work wishing you were on vacation, I\u0027ve been sitting in my parents\u0027 house and on the couches of several friends wishing that I had work to do. Without the stable base of my own place, it was indeed difficult to focus on anything. Socializing? Yes. Continued cycling around? Yes. Work? Absolutely no."

And yet, barbecue is not just a reminder of that purpose, but, in many ways, is that purpose. For barbecue is one of the great binding elements of the universe.

In the scant few seconds that I did venture into this room, what I did see scared me mightily. And I did not care to see more. So this information I bring you now is likely not even complete, not a full accounting of the barbecue perversions that occurred within."
