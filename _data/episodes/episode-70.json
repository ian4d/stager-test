Each week on our program, of course, we choose some theme, bring you documentary stories, original fiction, radio essays, anything we can think of on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Other People\u0027s Mail, stories of people reading stuff they\u0027re not supposed to see in the first place, and how it moves their hearts, and what happens after that."

Act Two, Thief. A college girl steals other people\u0027s mail. Mona Simpson reads an excerpt from her short story. Act Three, Saviors. A visit to the only post office employees who are allowed to actually read your mail. These are the people who deal with letters whose addresses are unreadable or incorrect or nonexistent. They open up the mail to try to get it to where it\u0027s supposed to go. Act Four, Voyeurs, in which our own Sarah Vowell picks a fight with me. Stay with us."

And as much as I like to look through dumpsters, there\u0027s not a whole lot that I\u0027m excited about finding. I\u0027m not real big on eating food out of dumpsters. So the one thing that really gets me excited is finding other people\u0027s mail. I love reading other people\u0027s mail. I actively look for it on the streets and in people\u0027s garbages, in dumpsters, at post office."

And while visiting her country, staying in a hotel there, he slept with this woman once. She wanted to see him again, idealized him, wanted to come visit him. But none of these trips ever seemed to happen. Pete only had the letters that she had written, her side of the story. But sometimes in her letters, she repeated things that he said."

She lied about a daughter of hers. She actually said that a daughter of hers had died. And then finally admitted, no, no, I was just lying about that. And over the course of these letters, this woman slowly puts her life in order. She goes to school, she gets a new job, often taking advice from the guy."

And so he says it\u0027s going to be platonic. And she says oh, that\u0027s fine, that\u0027s fine. But when you read between the lines, she just wants to see him and maybe once they reunited then the sparks will fly again."

He was always making her think that he might want to see her, but then he would always quash any plans that they had to actually get together. And this is the thing about reading other people\u0027s mail, as you read you cannot help but read between the lines. Anybody with any heart, any half sense of empathy fills in the details that are missing. You\u0027re thrown into this world that\u0027s part fiction writer and part detective."

And it\u0027s a real positive thing that they\u0027re saying to someone who is in real bad-- having a really bad life or they\u0027re very depressed or they\u0027re on the verge of suicide. And you kind of scan it and see that there wasn\u0027t maybe enough postage on it, there wasn\u0027t enough whatever. I send it forward to the person that they\u0027re trying to send it to.",

I\u0027ve seen a couple letters that were like long lost loves, trying to contact each other. And it was sad when you couldn\u0027t find an address to send it on to or back to.",

And you feel like you wish you could reach out and take all the names of all these people, which we\u0027re not allowed to do, and write down the names and addresses and go out and try to help them out. Just take up a collection for them or something.",

People writing-- oh, they\u0027ll have maybe a birth certificate or something inside. And they\u0027re writing to someone, here\u0027s your daughter\u0027s birth certificate. You can take care of the kids. I\u0027m leaving. Or people breaking engagements--",

These people that are in charge of-- the Postmaster General, I don\u0027t believe, has ever been a postal employee. So they don\u0027t have any concept of what goes on in the system. The sad part is even if those people came here physically, they just-- I hate to say it, my opinion-- I don\u0027t think they would care. And that is sad for the customer and it\u0027s sad for the employee, because you take pride in your work and you want to do what\u0027s right for the customer.

        "The title says it all, Other People\u0027s Mail. There\u0027s an apostrophe stuck on to that word, people. Now, I know that it\u0027s small and you could miss it pretty easily. But there\u0027s a world of meaning packed into that teensy little mark. It connotes the possessive case. And maybe I\u0027m being too literal, but the apostrophe draws a line between your stuff and someone else\u0027s.",
        "Alternative titles I\u0027ve considered for this, the Other People\u0027s Mail show, are None Of Your Bee\u0027s Wax, or I Got One Word For You, Gestapo, or Hey You, Get Out Of My Trash. I don\u0027t mean to sound self-righteous. Sure, what human being can resist reading over her neighbor\u0027s shoulder in the subway or looking in someone\u0027s window, if it\u0027s all lit up. But I\u0027d like to think that in a democracy, in This American Life, Mr. Glass, the words personal and private still mean something.",
        "Still, I have a job to do. And my job is not to prejudge, but to evaluate fair and square. So I went to Boston, as assigned, to visit Phil Milstein. He works as a graphic designer and lives in a normal apartment, filled with an abnormal number of shelves. He\u0027s a serious collector of other people\u0027s stuff, not just their mail-- crumpled notes he finds on the street, pieces of gum chewed by minor celebrities, and grocery shopping lists, which he scoops off the supermarket floor and pastes into scrapbooks.",

We had 4/10 of a second to look at the mail, read the ZIP code or the address, decide where it was to go, and then the mail would take off. And as it was going into the machine, we had 6/10 of a second to key a series of buttons as far as a code or sequence for it. And then that was, of course, computerized.

        "There is an element of strangeness that this reveals. I think that you\u0027re really getting down into a person\u0027s real inner psyche when they draw up a shopping list. I mean there\u0027s something very raw about the way people write these things. And that\u0027s part of what I\u0027m after.",
        "Some of them really do kind of reveal a person\u0027s subconscious, because when you\u0027re just testing the marker you\u0027re not really thinking about what you\u0027re writing. And so perhaps some truth might emerge that you\u0027re not really in control of. This person made some nice drawings of pirates or something using different colored pens and some markers. They\u0027re very colorful. And I think they\u0027re really pretty just to look at. This person drew a lot of music notes.",
        "I\u0027m not sure that I do look at real art. I mean, I\u0027m a sucker for these clashing, garish colors. Like hypnotizing a chicken, it\u0027s just not that hard to get art that appeals to me. Just put a lot of nice colors in and I\u0027ll be there.",
        "I think what interests me-- and this is almost in direct contrast to classical literature and art that you refer to-- I enjoy the snapshot of a moment of an average person\u0027s real life. I find it more interesting and more revealing than classical art or self-conscious art, art created as art. It\u0027s hard. You have to really think. And I just find the average person\u0027s work more interesting. Maybe it\u0027s a matter of, as a person of limited ability myself, I relate to that more.",
        "It\u0027s intimidating. I can\u0027t relate to it. It\u0027s beyond my abilities. And it makes me-- because deep down I want to be able to do great things, but I\u0027ve never really been able to. So there is an unfulfilled desire that I\u0027m forced to confront every time I see something great. In myself I just say, wow, that\u0027s above anything I could ever do. And it makes me realize all over again my own ordinariness.",
        "Yeah. But a lot of that comes from the period of my life where I was striving for that myself. And much of the more recent acquisitions is from the period in my life where I resigned myself to never being great, and switched my interests instead to documenting the abilities of everyday people.",

        "Ethically, this makes me scum. She certainly comes across as vapid. And inane as she comes across-- ethically, morally, she\u0027s clearly superior. She\u0027s trying hard to be a decent person. And you get that sense through her letters. And I, in a sense, am a total scumbag for picking apart her private life and making fun of it.",
        "Every time I go into the office supply store, I look at the shredders. And when they get cheap enough, I probably will get one because I do have personal things that I throw out. And I hope no one ever does to me what I do to them.",
        "Here is one of my very favorites, a typed shopping list. And best yet, they have cheese twice in a row. They really want cheese-- garbage bags, beans, cheese, cheese, lysol, rug cleaner, sponge, and bread.",
        "But they don\u0027t capitalize anything. So maybe they just were too lazy to hit the caps lock key on there. It\u0027s a manual typewriter, you\u0027ll notice. And so I can forgive them, not bothering with the caps-- those caps locks are heavy on those manuals."

        "When I get there, two bags are already on the table, sagging, waiting for me. Two old ladies. One\u0027s packages, one\u0027s mail. There\u0027s a small key opens the bank of doors, the little boxes, from the inside. Through the glass part of every mail slot, I can see. The AstroTurf field across the street over the parking lot, it\u0027s this light green. I watch the sky go from black to gray to blue, while I\u0027m there. Some days just stay foggy. Those are the best.",
        "Once you open a letter, you can\u0027t just put it in the mailbox. The person\u0027s going to say something. So I stash them in my pack and throw them out. Just people I know. Susan Brown, I open. Andy Larsen, Larry Helprin. All the popular kids from my high school. These are kids who drove places together, took vacations. They all skied. They went to the prom in one big group. At morning nutrition-- nutrition, it\u0027s your break at 10 o\u0027clock for doughnuts and stuff, California state law, you have to have it-- they used to meet outside on the far end of the math patio, all in one group. Some of them smoked. I\u0027ve seen them look at each other, concerned, at 10:00 in the morning. One touched the inside of another\u0027s wrist, like grown-ups in trouble.",
        "And now I know, everything I thought those three years, worst years of my life, turns out to be true. The ones here get letters. Carrie\u0027s at Santa Cruz. Lily\u0027s in San Diego. Kevin\u0027s at Harvard. Beth\u0027s at Stanford. And like from families, their letters talk about problems. They\u0027re each other\u0027s main lives. You always knew looking at them in high school, they weren\u0027t just kids who had fun. They cared. They cared about things. They\u0027re all worried about Lily now. Larry and Annie are flying down to talk her into staying at school.",
        "I saw Glenn the day I came to Berkeley. I took a walk through campus and I\u0027d been walking for almost an hour. And then I see Glenn coming down on a little hill by the infirmary, riding one of those lawn mowers you sit on, with grass flying out of the side. He\u0027s smiling. Not at me, just smiling. Clouds and sky behind his hair. Half of Tamalpais gone in fog. He was wearing this bright orange vest and I thought, fall\u0027s coming.",
        "I saw him that night again at our dorm cafeteria. This is the first time I\u0027ve been in love. I worry. I\u0027m a bad person, but Glenn\u0027s the perfect guy. I mean, for me at least. And he thinks he loves me. And I\u0027ve got to keep him from finding out about me. I\u0027ll die before I\u0027ll tell him. Glenn. OK, Glenn. He looks like Mick Jagger, but sweet. 10 times sweeter. He looks like he\u0027s about 10 years old. His father\u0027s a doctor over at UC Med, gynecological surgeon.",
        "First time we got together, a whole bunch of us were in Glenn\u0027s room, drinking beer. Glenn and his roommate collect beer cans. They have them stacked up. We\u0027re watching TV and finally everybody else leaves. There\u0027s nothing on but those gray lines and Glenn turns over on his bed and asks me if I\u0027d rub his back. I couldn\u0027t believe this was happening to me. I knew I didn\u0027t have to do anything. I just had to stay there. It would happen. I was sitting on his rear end, rubbing his back, going under his shirt with my hands. All of a sudden I was worried about my breath and what I smelled like. Glenn\u0027s face was down in the pillow. I tried to sniff myself, but I couldn\u0027t tell anything. And it went all right anyway.",
        "I don\u0027t open Glenn\u0027s letters, but I touch them. I hold them and smell them. None of his mail has any smell. He doesn\u0027t get many letters. His parents live across the Bay in Marin County. They don\u0027t write. He gets letters from his grandmother in Michigan, plain, even handwriting on regular envelopes, a sticker with her return address printed on it. Rural Route Number 3, Gunn Street. See, I got it memorized.",
        "And he gets letters from Diane. Di, they call her. High school girlfriend. Has a pushy mother, wants her to be a scientist, but she already got a C in Chem 1A. I got an A+, not to brag. He never slept with her, though. She wouldn\u0027t. She\u0027s still a virgin down in San Diego. With Lily, maybe they even know each other. Glenn and Di were popular kids in their high school, Redwood High. Now I\u0027m one because of Glenn, because I\u0027m his girlfriend. I know that\u0027s why. Not because of me. I just know, OK. I\u0027m not going to start fooling myself now. Please.",
        "Her letters, I hold up to the light. They\u0027ve got fluorescent lights in there. She\u0027s supposed to be blonde, you know, and pretty, quiet, the soft type. And the envelopes, she writes on these sheer cream-colored envelopes and they get transparent. And I can see her writing underneath, but not enough to read what it says. It\u0027s like those hockey lines painted under layers of ice. I run my tongue along the place where his grandmother sealed the letter. A sharp, sweet gummy taste. Once I cut my tongue.",
        "That\u0027s what keeps me going to the bottom of the bag. I\u0027m always wondering if there will be a letter for Glenn. He doesn\u0027t get one every week. It\u0027s like a treasure, Crackerjack prize. But I\u0027d never open Glenn\u0027s mail. I kiss all four corners where his fingers will touch, before I put it in his box.",
        "I brought home cookies for Lauren and me. Just a present. We\u0027ll eat them or Glenn will eat them. I\u0027ll throw them out, for all I care. They\u0027re chocolate chip with pecans. This was one good mother, a lucky can. I brought us coffee, too. I bought it.",
        "Yeah, OK, so I\u0027m in trouble. Wednesday at 10:30 I got this notice I was supposed to appear. I had a class, Chem 1C, pre-med staple, your critical thing. I never missed it before. I told Glenn I had a doctor\u0027s appointment. OK, so I skip it anyway. And I walk into this room and there\u0027s these two other guys, all work in the mail room, doing what I do, sorting. And we all sit there on chairs, on this green carpet. I was staring at everybody\u0027s shoes.",
        "And there\u0027s a cop, University cop, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the difference. He had this sagging, pear-shaped body, like what my dad would have, if he were fat. But he\u0027s not. He\u0027s thin. He walks slowly on the carpeting, his fingers hooked in his belt loops. I was watching his hips. Anyway, he\u0027s accusing us all. And he\u0027s trying to get one of us to admit we did it. No way.",
        "\"I hope one of you will come to me and tell the truth. Not a one of you knows anything about this? Come on now.\"",
        "I shake my head no, and stare down at the three pairs of shoes. He says they\u0027re not going to do anything to the person who did it. Right. Want to make a bet? They say they just want to know. But they\u0027ll take it back, as soon as you tell them. I don\u0027t care why I don\u0027t believe him. I know one thing for sure, and that\u0027s they\u0027re not going to do anything to me, as long as I say no, I didn\u0027t do it. That\u0027s what I said, no, I didn\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t know a thing about it. I just can\u0027t imagine where those missing packages could have gone, how letters got into garbage cans, awful. I just don\u0027t know.",
        "This tall, skinny guy with a blonde mustache, Wallabees, looks kind of like a rabbit, he defended us. He\u0027s another sorter. Works Monday, Wednesdays. We all do our jobs, he says. None of us would do that. The rabbity guy looks at me and the other girl for support. So we\u0027re gonna stick together. The other girl, a dark blonde, chewing her lip, nodded. I loved that rabbity guy that second. I nodded, too. The cop looked down, wide hips, and the coffee-with-milk-colored pants. He sighed. I looked up at the rabbity guy. They let us all go.",
        "I\u0027m just going to keep saying no, not me, didn\u0027t do it. And I just won\u0027t do it again, that\u0027s all. Won\u0027t do it anymore. So this is Glenn\u0027s last chance for homemade cookies. I\u0027m sure as hell not going to bake any. I signed the form, said I didn\u0027t do it. I\u0027m OK now. I\u0027m safe. It turned out OK after all. It always does. I always think something terrible is going to happen and it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m lucky.",
        "I was walking just a little while ago today, down Telegraph with Glenn. And these two policemen, not the one I\u0027d met, other policemen, were coming in our direction. I started sweating a lot. I was sure, until they passed us. I wish sure it was all over. They were there for me. I always think that. But at the same time, I know it\u0027s just my imagination. I mean, I\u0027m a 4.0 student. I\u0027m a nice girl, just walking down the street with my boyfriend.",
        "I steal. I\u0027ve stolen books and money and even letters. Letters are great. I work in the mail room of my dormitory, Saturday mornings. I sort mail, put the letters in these long narrow cubbyholes. The insides of mailboxes. It\u0027s cool there when I stick in my arm.",
        "I\u0027ve stolen cash-- these crisp, crackling, brand new twenty-dollar bills that fathers and grandmothers send, sealed up in sheets of wax paper. Once I got a fifty. I\u0027ve stolen presents, too. I got a sweater and a football.",
        "Mostly, what I take are cookies. No evidence. They\u0027re edible. I can spot the coffee cans of chocolate chip. You can smell it right through the wrapping. A cool smell, like the inside of a pantry. Sometimes I eat straight through the can during my shift.",
        "Tampering with the United States mail is a Federal Crime, I know. Listen, let me tell you, I know. I got a summons in my mailbox to go to the Employment Office next Wednesday. Sure, I\u0027m scared.",
        "The University cops want to talk to me. Great. They think, suspect is the word they use, that one of us is throwing out mail instead of sorting it. Us is the others. I\u0027m not the only sorter. I just work Saturdays, mail comes, you know, six days a week in this country. They\u0027ll never guess it\u0027s me.",
        "They say this in the letter, they think it\u0027s out of LAZINESS. Wanting to hurry up and get done, not spend the time. But I don\u0027t hurry. I\u0027m really patient on Saturday mornings. I leave my dorm early, while Lauren\u0027s still asleep, I open the mailroom-- it\u0027s this heavy door and I have my own key."

I could tell because she was showing off her house and her Christmas tree and her presents. And she was standing by the fireplace. And there\u0027s a whole bunch of her Christmas letters along the mantle there. So what I did was I took a magnifying glass and me and a friend were able to piece together her address from these five or six different Christmas cards that she had on her mantel piece. And a little bit of eye strain, but we couldn\u0027t get her name, but we got her address, her street address and her city and ZIP. Looked up the ZIP. Then we sent back her photographs. She probably never knew how we found that out. But I\u0027m sure she got her photographs back."

        "Even with all these people making all this effort, only 10% of the packages and 30% of the letters that come into the Mail Recovery Center are successfully sent on. With some items, there\u0027s just no way to get them to their destination. There\u0027s no address, no return address, nothing at all. But then there are other items that maybe could be returned if you were willing to put the kind of effort into it that Ken [? Grolkey ?] did with the Christmas photos.",
        "The question is, is it worth it? And that\u0027s when the job gets tricky, deciding what\u0027s worth sending on and what\u0027s not. Greg Hawthorne is the acting supervisor on the day shift. He\u0027s management. He\u0027s not actually in there, dealing with the mail every day. And so, maybe a little predictably, when I ask him how you decide what gets sent back, he tells me that you go by the book.",
        "What that someone, somewhere decided was essentially what out of everything that we put in the mail is most valuable? Well, here\u0027s what the regulations say. Checks, they always get sent back. Legal papers, stock certificates, those get returned. With personal letters though, the basic rule is that if there\u0027s something worth $10 or more, that gets sent back, if it can. But everything else gets disposed of.",
        "That\u0027s Greg\u0027s version. But when I talk to the people who actually deal with the mail, I heard a different story. This is Anne [? Zeemer. ?]",
        "The reason for this difference of opinion is pretty simple. It\u0027s not that Greg is a by-the-book square and Anne is a rule-bending softie. It\u0027s not that Greg is management and Anne is labor. It\u0027s that Greg doesn\u0027t read other people\u0027s mail all day. And Anne, and Ken, and Lorinda, and all the other clerks I spoke to in St. Paul, they do. And that changes things. They\u0027re face to face every day with parts of our lives whose value is hard to quantify.",
        "This is Betty Jones.",
        "The clerks here say it\u0027s a strange experience to see into all of these lives. Strange, and not always happy. One day after work, Betty and I sat out behind the Mail Recovery Center, at a picnic table next to the loading docks. And we spoke for awhile about what that experience is like.",
        "Betty actually had to fight with the post office in order to keep her job at the Mail Recovery Center. She first came here in 1989, on a temporary basis after she developed carpal tunnel syndrome at her previous job sorting mail. But after five years, she was told that she couldn\u0027t work here anymore. They said that because of her injuries, she wasn\u0027t able to do the job. And that was despite the fact that she\u0027d been doing it successfully for years.",
        "She filed a grievance. And after a few months in limbo, she won her job back. And of all the people I talked to here, she\u0027s the one who seems to be the most affected by what she sees in the mail. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s because of everything that she had to go through to stay here, but I think it might be.",
        "I should say at this point that all of the clerks I spoke to, especially Betty, emphasized that they\u0027re not just diving into a pile of mail and reading through people\u0027s personal letters for curiosity\u0027s sake. They open first-class mail to look for items of value, things that are worth more than $10, like maybe some cash or a pin or some photos. And then they scan the letters. They don\u0027t read them, everyone told me. They scan them, looking for an address or a name or any information that might help get the letter to where it\u0027s supposed to go.",
        "I believe everyone who told me this. I don\u0027t think anyone at the Mail Recovery Center reads mail for any kind of voyeuristic thrill. But I also believe that, like everything at the Center, the reality is more complicated than the regulations. And when you\u0027ve just opened a letter from a child to her mother who\u0027s in prison, or from a man writing to his dead wife, the human material in front of you is so incredible that you can\u0027t help but scan a little more slowly than is perhaps absolutely necessary.",
        "There are a lot of reasons why things end up at the Mail Recovery Center. Someone left an address off a letter, someone moved and didn\u0027t let anybody know, someone\u0027s envelope got wet and then the ink ran. For whatever reason, it ends up here.",
        "That feeling of personal connection that the clerks get from reading other people\u0027s mail is sometimes painful. But it\u0027s also precisely what makes mail recovery one of the most sought-after jobs in the post office. I didn\u0027t quite realize how sought-after a job it is, though, until I spoke one morning to Jerry Jacobson. He doesn\u0027t work at the Mail Recovery Center. He works for the union in Saint Paul that represents these workers. But before he got his union job, he spent 12 years working as a postal clerk, sorting letters. And he told me that about half the people who work in the post office work out of sight of the public, in warehouses, where they operate the giant machines that sort the nation\u0027s mail.",
        "Almost everyone I interviewed that worked at the Mail Recovery Center had spent at least a few years on a letter sorting machine, punching in 60 codes a minute, eight hours a day. Ken did it. Lorinda did it. Betty did it. That\u0027s how she got carpal tunnel syndrome. No one I talked to looked back on those years with much fondness.",
        "But the people who work at the St. Paul Mail Recovery Center may, in fact, soon have to go back to the mail sorting jobs that they escaped. When I visited, everybody was talking about this proposal that had just been floated that would shut the Center down in just a few months. No one\u0027s sure now whether it\u0027s really going to happen. Information\u0027s hard to come by, even for people that work there. But next October, the post office\u0027s board of governors is going to meet to discuss the Center\u0027s future. And they might decide to shut it down for good.",
        "A lot of the people I spoke to in St. Paul saw this as a symptom of larger changes that are going on in the post office. A few years ago, there were seven Mail Recovery Centers around the country. Now there are three. And there\u0027s talk of closing another one soon. The reason is that the people in charge of the post office have, over the past few years, been concentrating more and more on cost cutting, and that means automation. Every part of the post office, from letter sorting to delivery, and even to mail recovery, is becoming more automated. The result is that postal workers, the ones I spoke to anyway, feel less and less valuable to the people in charge.",
        "I think it was you, Betty, who said that if the people at the top really knew what was going on in here, knew what sort of work people were doing in here, they wouldn\u0027t be trying to close it. What is it that they don\u0027t know?",
        "The great thing about the Mail Recovery Center is this, you\u0027ve got this vast machine called the United States Postal Service, which is becoming more and more automated, less and less human. And then here in this little out-of-the-way warehouse on an access road in St. Paul, you\u0027ve got 75 people who are doing work that takes brains and heart, that makes them fulfilled, and makes the people they serve happy. It\u0027s like the land that time forgot.",
        "And a lot of it ends up here. There are 150,000 pieces of mail that arrive here each day. And the 75 people who work here all basically have the same job, to open up the mail, look inside, and see if they can figure out where it\u0027s supposed to go. And they see some pretty strange things, things that the rest of us don\u0027t. It\u0027s sort of a postal cross-section, a random sampling of what America mails. A clerk named Lauren [? Dicosad ?] told me about some of the things they find.",
        "One of the weird things about talking to the people at the MRC about the possibility that they might lose their jobs, was that they were upset about it. But they also seem kind of resigned to it. It\u0027s like they knew that they were out of step with the new go-go, super-automated post office. It\u0027s like they felt that they\u0027ve been getting away with something by having interesting jobs, and now they\u0027ve been found out.",
        "On the wall of the Mail Recovery Center are posted a slew of letters, mostly handwritten, from people who have had things returned to them. All the letters are filled with gratitude. And what\u0027s more, they all have this air of amazement to them. None of these people knew that this service even existed. And then suddenly, they got their insurance forms or their bank deposits or their engagement ring back. One letter that Greg Hawthorne showed me said, \"We want to let you know how much we appreciate you taking the time to find our Christmas gifts. You\u0027ve restored our faith in humanity.\" You have to wonder if 10 years from now, the post office will still be getting letters like that.",
        "[MUSIC - \"THE LETTER\" BY MEKONS]",
        "And that\u0027s in packages or in letters?",
        "The goal is always to return lost mail, if it\u0027s possible. Sometimes it\u0027s not too hard. There\u0027s a check in the envelope and there\u0027s an address on the check. They send it back. Sometimes the person\u0027s moved and left no forwarding address. In that case, there are clerks who scan through these huge computer databases of names and addresses. And sometimes they can find a good address that way. Sometimes they have to resort to real detective work, like Ken [? Grolkey, ?] who\u0027s been working here for eight years."

Route 11. Why? Young, stupid, high on beer. Three, Yes, he answers all questions. Four, Monte Carlo Super Sport, night before Easter, Route 11. Five, Yes, it all leads up to driving drunk.",
        "I came upon a 1979 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, whose front end was so mangled that the engine was pushed through the firewall and up into the windshield. In it was another student paper, only this one was probably passed quietly in class.",
        "I found a letter in a 1978 Toyota Celica Liftback. The car was so badly crushed on the left side that the driver\u0027s door took up the entire front seat.",
        "The inspiration for my project came about in the spring of 1994 while visiting a local automobile wrecking establishment in Contra Costa County, California. While searching for a Bendix spring for Negativland\u0027s company mascot, a 1976 Mercury Monarch Ghia, I made a shocking discovery. I stumbled upon a metallic root beer 1971 Dodge Demon that I\u0027d previously owned and meticulously maintained until selling it two years earlier.",
        "In about a month\u0027s time, I\u0027d collected more than enough documents to complete my book. But the act of gathering them had become an obsession and it was difficult to know when to quit. I finally stopped myself after an eerie discovery in a car that had been demolished beyond recognition. It must have belonged to a member of the church choir, and strangely, it was the only thing in the car-- a single photocopy of a hymn by Dion de Marbelle, \"When They Ring The Golden Bells.\"",
        "\"When our days shall know their number, And in death we sweetly slumber, When the King commands the spirit to be free, Never more with anguish laden We shall reach that lovely Aiden, When they ring the golden bells for you and me.\"",
        "Drive carefully.",
        "To my horror, the car had been broadsided with great force and the occupants had been neatly extracted with the jaws of life through a perfect cut over the edge of the roof line. Upon further inspection, it became obvious that the car had not only been wrecked, but trashed over a period of time beforehand. Curiosity led me to search its interior for clues on what methods of torture could have brought my once beautiful car bomb to this endscape.",
        "And what I found was fascinating. The melted plastic seats and orange carpet were littered with an assortment of paper scraps documenting the life of a 17-year-old single mother and her tumultuous relationship with an abusive 38-year-old boyfriend. The car smelled of sewage water and empty Pepsi containers attracted bees. But I continued to collect and collate everything I could find, love notes, hate letters, personal records, receipts, photographs.",
        "Several days passed before I fully realized the extraordinary effect this experience had on me. I couldn\u0027t help wondering if she\u0027d been killed or badly injured, and what about her infant son? Was she even in the car? Perhaps her drunken beau, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, had taken the Demon on its fateful joy ride.",
        "I recalled observing similar remains in other discarded vehicles. And upon further consideration, I picked up my camera and left to see what else was out there. The older cars were the most interesting-- unpaid parking tickets, failure to appear notices, unopened mail from collection agencies, lottery receipts, losing game cards from fast food restaurants. Then there were the letters. I found one letter in a 1977 Buick Regal, whose roof had been completely torn off and the body was twisted in half."

And as much as I like to look through dumpsters, there\u0027s not a whole lot that I\u0027m excited about finding. I\u0027m not real big on eating food out of dumpsters. So the one thing that really gets me excited is finding other people\u0027s mail. I love reading other people\u0027s mail. I actively look for it on the streets and in people\u0027s garbages, in dumpsters, at post office.",
            "They were in no chronological order, so I just had to open the first one that I could grab. And read one after another that way, which was kind of confusing at first because I jumped right into the middle of what appeared to be a relationship between a woman and a man. But I slowly put it together as a puzzle.",
            "I think it is just she never had somebody to really lean on and to seek advice from or just to tell her problems to, or at least nobody who was stable. And so he says it\u0027s going to be platonic. And she says oh, that\u0027s fine, that\u0027s fine. But when you read between the lines, she just wants to see him and maybe once they reunited then the sparks will fly again.",

            "This story of voyeurism, innocent voyeurism, starts off simply enough. Pete was supposed to meet a friend when she got off from work. He arrived two hours early.",
            "Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it is This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose some theme, bring you documentary stories, original fiction, radio essays, anything we can think of on that theme. Today\u0027s program, Other People\u0027s Mail, stories of people reading stuff they\u0027re not supposed to see in the first place, and how it moves their hearts, and what happens after that.",
            "Act One of our program today, Dead Letters. Richard Lyons walks through a car junkyard and finds in the crumpled up wrecks letters and notes of the people who once lived in these cars. Act Two, Thief. A college girl steals other people\u0027s mail. Mona Simpson reads an excerpt from her short story. Act Three, Saviors. A visit to the only post office employees who are allowed to actually read your mail. These are the people who deal with letters whose addresses are unreadable or incorrect or nonexistent. They open up the mail to try to get it to where it\u0027s supposed to go. Act Four, Voyeurs, in which our own Sarah Vowell picks a fight with me. Stay with us.",
            "On this particular day, Pete found a big bag of letters, maybe 100 pieces of mail, written over a year and a half. He\u0027s excited. It seemed like hours of reading.",
            "Here\u0027s the picture that emerged as he put this puzzle together. The woman lived in another country. The guy lived in the United States. And while visiting her country, staying in a hotel there, he slept with this woman once. She wanted to see him again, idealized him, wanted to come visit him. But none of these trips ever seemed to happen. Pete only had the letters that she had written, her side of the story. But sometimes in her letters, she repeated things that he said.",
            "And over the course of the correspondence, all sorts of things happened. This woman went to jail, and then lied about it to the guy, and then finally admitted the whole thing. She lied about a daughter of hers. She actually said that a daughter of hers had died. And then finally admitted, no, no, I was just lying about that. And over the course of these letters, this woman slowly puts her life in order. She goes to school, she gets a new job, often taking advice from the guy.",
            "As he read, Pete started to feel protective of this woman. The guy seemed to be sending mixed messages. The guy, to him, seemed like a total jerk, really. He was always making her think that he might want to see her, but then he would always quash any plans that they had to actually get together. And this is the thing about reading other people\u0027s mail, as you read you cannot help but read between the lines. Anybody with any heart, any half sense of empathy fills in the details that are missing. You\u0027re thrown into this world that\u0027s part fiction writer and part detective."

            "Act One, Dead Letters. Well, Richard Lyons is in the band Negativland, which is known for using a lot of found sound in their recordings. And a couple years ago he put together-- he xeroxed just a couple copies of it for a few friends. And it was made of these objects he had found, letters and notes. It\u0027s really this incredible document. When you open to any page, what you see is, on the right side there\u0027s a photo of some smashed up, demolished car. And on the left, there\u0027s a letter or a shopping list or some note found inside that totalled car. He agreed to tell the story here. All the names and certain identifying details have been changed.",

            "I photographed every car I searched and compiled the information in the form of a xeroxed book, transcribing the text exactly as it was written and positioning it next to the photo. I pulled a list from a crushed 1987 Volkswagen Fox entitled, What I Need. Couch, love seat, chair, coffee table, dinner table, TV, radio.",
            "I found a writing assignment by a local community college student in a totalled Chevy van. Apparently, he hadn\u0027t learned his lesson. James D., English 122, November 22, 1993. One, a car accident two years ago taught me the dangers of drinking and driving. A car accident, it\u0027s bad. Two, Who? Him and his buddies. What? Drove drunk. When? 11:30 PM, Easter eve. Where? Route 11. Why? Young, stupid, high on beer. Three, Yes, he answers all questions. Four, Monte Carlo Super Sport, night before Easter, Route 11. Five, Yes, it all leads up to driving drunk.",
            "I came upon a 1979 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, whose front end was so mangled that the engine was pushed through the firewall and up into the windshield. In it was another student paper, only this one was probably passed quietly in class.",
            "I found a letter in a 1978 Toyota Celica Liftback. The car was so badly crushed on the left side that the driver\u0027s door took up the entire front seat.",
            "The inspiration for my project came about in the spring of 1994 while visiting a local automobile wrecking establishment in Contra Costa County, California. While searching for a Bendix spring for Negativland\u0027s company mascot, a 1976 Mercury Monarch Ghia, I made a shocking discovery. I stumbled upon a metallic root beer 1971 Dodge Demon that I\u0027d previously owned and meticulously maintained until selling it two years earlier.",
            "In about a month\u0027s time, I\u0027d collected more than enough documents to complete my book. But the act of gathering them had become an obsession and it was difficult to know when to quit. I finally stopped myself after an eerie discovery in a car that had been demolished beyond recognition. It must have belonged to a member of the church choir, and strangely, it was the only thing in the car-- a single photocopy of a hymn by Dion de Marbelle, \"When They Ring The Golden Bells.\"",
            "\"When our days shall know their number, And in death we sweetly slumber, When the King commands the spirit to be free, Never more with anguish laden We shall reach that lovely Aiden, When they ring the golden bells for you and me.\"",
            "Drive carefully.",
            "To my horror, the car had been broadsided with great force and the occupants had been neatly extracted with the jaws of life through a perfect cut over the edge of the roof line. Upon further inspection, it became obvious that the car had not only been wrecked, but trashed over a period of time beforehand. Curiosity led me to search its interior for clues on what methods of torture could have brought my once beautiful car bomb to this endscape.",
            "And what I found was fascinating. The melted plastic seats and orange carpet were littered with an assortment of paper scraps documenting the life of a 17-year-old single mother and her tumultuous relationship with an abusive 38-year-old boyfriend. The car smelled of sewage water and empty Pepsi containers attracted bees. But I continued to collect and collate everything I could find, love notes, hate letters, personal records, receipts, photographs.",
            "Several days passed before I fully realized the extraordinary effect this experience had on me. I couldn\u0027t help wondering if she\u0027d been killed or badly injured, and what about her infant son? Was she even in the car? Perhaps her drunken beau, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, had taken the Demon on its fateful joy ride.",
            "I recalled observing similar remains in other discarded vehicles. And upon further consideration, I picked up my camera and left to see what else was out there. The older cars were the most interesting-- unpaid parking tickets, failure to appear notices, unopened mail from collection agencies, lottery receipts, losing game cards from fast food restaurants. Then there were the letters. I found one letter in a 1977 Buick Regal, whose roof had been completely torn off and the body was twisted in half."

And on the left, there\u0027s a letter or a shopping list or some note found inside that totalled car. He agreed to tell the story here.

In this job, he was a reporter at a small newspaper in a small town, and they had a basic office computer system. And then one day on a whim, he tried to log in as the owner of the newspaper. For the password, he just typed in the name of the guy\u0027s grandson. It worked. He suddenly had access to every file in the newspaper\u0027s computer, every story, every accounting record, every email.",
            "My friend says it was miserable. Most of the mail was depressingly banal, not worth reading. The main thing that he learned was that at the beginning of the year, nearly everyone in the office had gotten a bigger raise than he had. Reporters whose stories he thought were terrible had made much more than he did.",
            "Novelist Mona Simpson, reading an excerpt from her story, Lawns. Coming up, postal employees reading your mail and bending the rules for you, yes, you. That\u0027s in a minute, from Public Radio International, when our program continues.",
            "When you open other people\u0027s mail, things can happen, unless you\u0027re careful. With that in mind, we turn to Mona Simpson. She\u0027s the author of numerous books. This is an excerpt of a short story she wrote a few years ago, called Lawns."

            "When I get there, two bags are already on the table, sagging, waiting for me. Two old ladies. One\u0027s packages, one\u0027s mail. There\u0027s a small key opens the bank of doors, the little boxes, from the inside. Through the glass part of every mail slot, I can see. The AstroTurf field across the street over the parking lot, it\u0027s this light green. I watch the sky go from black to gray to blue, while I\u0027m there. Some days just stay foggy. Those are the best.",
            "Once you open a letter, you can\u0027t just put it in the mailbox. The person\u0027s going to say something. So I stash them in my pack and throw them out. Just people I know. Susan Brown, I open. Andy Larsen, Larry Helprin. All the popular kids from my high school. These are kids who drove places together, took vacations. They all skied. They went to the prom in one big group. At morning nutrition-- nutrition, it\u0027s your break at 10 o\u0027clock for doughnuts and stuff, California state law, you have to have it-- they used to meet outside on the far end of the math patio, all in one group. Some of them smoked. I\u0027ve seen them look at each other, concerned, at 10:00 in the morning. One touched the inside of another\u0027s wrist, like grown-ups in trouble.",
            "And now I know, everything I thought those three years, worst years of my life, turns out to be true. The ones here get letters. Carrie\u0027s at Santa Cruz. Lily\u0027s in San Diego. Kevin\u0027s at Harvard. Beth\u0027s at Stanford. And like from families, their letters talk about problems. They\u0027re each other\u0027s main lives. You always knew looking at them in high school, they weren\u0027t just kids who had fun. They cared. They cared about things. They\u0027re all worried about Lily now. Larry and Annie are flying down to talk her into staying at school.",
            "I saw Glenn the day I came to Berkeley. I took a walk through campus and I\u0027d been walking for almost an hour. And then I see Glenn coming down on a little hill by the infirmary, riding one of those lawn mowers you sit on, with grass flying out of the side. He\u0027s smiling. Not at me, just smiling. Clouds and sky behind his hair. Half of Tamalpais gone in fog. He was wearing this bright orange vest and I thought, fall\u0027s coming.",
            "I saw him that night again at our dorm cafeteria. This is the first time I\u0027ve been in love. I worry. I\u0027m a bad person, but Glenn\u0027s the perfect guy. I mean, for me at least. And he thinks he loves me. And I\u0027ve got to keep him from finding out about me. I\u0027ll die before I\u0027ll tell him. Glenn. OK, Glenn. He looks like Mick Jagger, but sweet. 10 times sweeter. He looks like he\u0027s about 10 years old. His father\u0027s a doctor over at UC Med, gynecological surgeon.",
            "First time we got together, a whole bunch of us were in Glenn\u0027s room, drinking beer. Glenn and his roommate collect beer cans. They have them stacked up. We\u0027re watching TV and finally everybody else leaves. There\u0027s nothing on but those gray lines and Glenn turns over on his bed and asks me if I\u0027d rub his back. I couldn\u0027t believe this was happening to me. I knew I didn\u0027t have to do anything. I just had to stay there. It would happen. I was sitting on his rear end, rubbing his back, going under his shirt with my hands. All of a sudden I was worried about my breath and what I smelled like. Glenn\u0027s face was down in the pillow. I tried to sniff myself, but I couldn\u0027t tell anything. And it went all right anyway.",
            "I don\u0027t open Glenn\u0027s letters, but I touch them. I hold them and smell them. None of his mail has any smell. He doesn\u0027t get many letters. His parents live across the Bay in Marin County. They don\u0027t write. He gets letters from his grandmother in Michigan, plain, even handwriting on regular envelopes, a sticker with her return address printed on it. Rural Route Number 3, Gunn Street. See, I got it memorized.",
            "And he gets letters from Diane. Di, they call her. High school girlfriend. Has a pushy mother, wants her to be a scientist, but she already got a C in Chem 1A. I got an A+, not to brag. He never slept with her, though. She wouldn\u0027t. She\u0027s still a virgin down in San Diego. With Lily, maybe they even know each other. Glenn and Di were popular kids in their high school, Redwood High. Now I\u0027m one because of Glenn, because I\u0027m his girlfriend. I know that\u0027s why. Not because of me. I just know, OK. I\u0027m not going to start fooling myself now. Please.",
            "Her letters, I hold up to the light. They\u0027ve got fluorescent lights in there. She\u0027s supposed to be blonde, you know, and pretty, quiet, the soft type. And the envelopes, she writes on these sheer cream-colored envelopes and they get transparent. And I can see her writing underneath, but not enough to read what it says. It\u0027s like those hockey lines painted under layers of ice. I run my tongue along the place where his grandmother sealed the letter. A sharp, sweet gummy taste. Once I cut my tongue.",
            "That\u0027s what keeps me going to the bottom of the bag. I\u0027m always wondering if there will be a letter for Glenn. He doesn\u0027t get one every week. It\u0027s like a treasure, Crackerjack prize. But I\u0027d never open Glenn\u0027s mail. I kiss all four corners where his fingers will touch, before I put it in his box.",
            "I brought home cookies for Lauren and me. Just a present. We\u0027ll eat them or Glenn will eat them. I\u0027ll throw them out, for all I care. They\u0027re chocolate chip with pecans. This was one good mother, a lucky can. I brought us coffee, too. I bought it.",
            "Yeah, OK, so I\u0027m in trouble. Wednesday at 10:30 I got this notice I was supposed to appear. I had a class, Chem 1C, pre-med staple, your critical thing. I never missed it before. I told Glenn I had a doctor\u0027s appointment. OK, so I skip it anyway. And I walk into this room and there\u0027s these two other guys, all work in the mail room, doing what I do, sorting. And we all sit there on chairs, on this green carpet. I was staring at everybody\u0027s shoes.",
            "And there\u0027s a cop, University cop, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the difference. He had this sagging, pear-shaped body, like what my dad would have, if he were fat. But he\u0027s not. He\u0027s thin. He walks slowly on the carpeting, his fingers hooked in his belt loops. I was watching his hips. Anyway, he\u0027s accusing us all. And he\u0027s trying to get one of us to admit we did it. No way.",
            "\"I hope one of you will come to me and tell the truth. Not a one of you knows anything about this? Come on now.\"",
            "I shake my head no, and stare down at the three pairs of shoes. He says they\u0027re not going to do anything to the person who did it. Right. Want to make a bet? They say they just want to know. But they\u0027ll take it back, as soon as you tell them. I don\u0027t care why I don\u0027t believe him. I know one thing for sure, and that\u0027s they\u0027re not going to do anything to me, as long as I say no, I didn\u0027t do it. That\u0027s what I said, no, I didn\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t know a thing about it. I just can\u0027t imagine where those missing packages could have gone, how letters got into garbage cans, awful. I just don\u0027t know.",
            "This tall, skinny guy with a blonde mustache, Wallabees, looks kind of like a rabbit, he defended us. He\u0027s another sorter. Works Monday, Wednesdays. We all do our jobs, he says. None of us would do that. The rabbity guy looks at me and the other girl for support. So we\u0027re gonna stick together. The other girl, a dark blonde, chewing her lip, nodded. I loved that rabbity guy that second. I nodded, too. The cop looked down, wide hips, and the coffee-with-milk-colored pants. He sighed. I looked up at the rabbity guy. They let us all go.",
            "I\u0027m just going to keep saying no, not me, didn\u0027t do it. And I just won\u0027t do it again, that\u0027s all. Won\u0027t do it anymore. So this is Glenn\u0027s last chance for homemade cookies. I\u0027m sure as hell not going to bake any. I signed the form, said I didn\u0027t do it. I\u0027m OK now. I\u0027m safe. It turned out OK after all. It always does. I always think something terrible is going to happen and it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m lucky.",
            "I was walking just a little while ago today, down Telegraph with Glenn. And these two policemen, not the one I\u0027d met, other policemen, were coming in our direction. I started sweating a lot. I was sure, until they passed us. I wish sure it was all over. They were there for me. I always think that. But at the same time, I know it\u0027s just my imagination. I mean, I\u0027m a 4.0 student. I\u0027m a nice girl, just walking down the street with my boyfriend.",
            "I steal. I\u0027ve stolen books and money and even letters. Letters are great. I work in the mail room of my dormitory, Saturday mornings. I sort mail, put the letters in these long narrow cubbyholes. The insides of mailboxes. It\u0027s cool there when I stick in my arm.",
            "I\u0027ve stolen cash-- these crisp, crackling, brand new twenty-dollar bills that fathers and grandmothers send, sealed up in sheets of wax paper. Once I got a fifty. I\u0027ve stolen presents, too. I got a sweater and a football.",
            "Mostly, what I take are cookies. No evidence. They\u0027re edible. I can spot the coffee cans of chocolate chip. You can smell it right through the wrapping. A cool smell, like the inside of a pantry. Sometimes I eat straight through the can during my shift.",
            "Tampering with the United States mail is a Federal Crime, I know. Listen, let me tell you, I know. I got a summons in my mailbox to go to the Employment Office next Wednesday. Sure, I\u0027m scared.",
            "The University cops want to talk to me. Great. They think, suspect is the word they use, that one of us is throwing out mail instead of sorting it. Us is the others. I\u0027m not the only sorter. I just work Saturdays, mail comes, you know, six days a week in this country. They\u0027ll never guess it\u0027s me.",
            "They say this in the letter, they think it\u0027s out of LAZINESS. Wanting to hurry up and get done, not spend the time. But I don\u0027t hurry. I\u0027m really patient on Saturday mornings. I leave my dorm early, while Lauren\u0027s still asleep, I open the mailroom-- it\u0027s this heavy door and I have my own key."

And there\u0027s a whole bunch of her Christmas letters along the mantle there. So what I did was I took a magnifying glass and me and a friend were able to piece together her address from these five or six different Christmas cards that she had on her mantel piece. And a little bit of eye strain, but we couldn\u0027t get her name, but we got her address, her street address and her city and ZIP. Looked up the ZIP. Then we sent back her photographs. She probably never knew how we found that out. But I\u0027m sure she got her photographs back."

And it\u0027s a real positive thing that they\u0027re saying to someone who is in real bad-- having a really bad life or they\u0027re very depressed or they\u0027re on the verge of suicide. And you kind of scan it and see that there wasn\u0027t maybe enough postage on it, there wasn\u0027t enough whatever. I send it forward to the person that they\u0027re trying to send it to.",
            "And it may seem unimportant to someone else. And perhaps the postal service wouldn\u0027t think it was maybe important, but I feel it is. And I feel it\u0027s within our realm to make that judgment.",
            "You see a lot that\u0027s going on, just like you see in the news. And you think oh, I see that in the news. I see that at work all the time. This goes on or that goes on. These people\u0027s lives change. And we see it in the letters that we have to scan.",
            "It bothers me to see a lot of people that are in so much pain and problems and they\u0027re sending these sad letters to someone and it doesn\u0027t get to them. I\u0027ve seen a couple letters that were like long lost loves, trying to contact each other. And it was sad when you couldn\u0027t find an address to send it on to or back to.",
            "And then there are people in the world that are very needy. They have very little in their life. And you feel like you wish you could reach out and take all the names of all these people, which we\u0027re not allowed to do, and write down the names and addresses and go out and try to help them out. Just take up a collection for them or something.",
            "Someone telling someone, it\u0027s over, I don\u0027t care for you anymore-- or gee, so-and-so died, or so-and-so got killed last year, or your daughter is dying of cancer. People writing-- oh, they\u0027ll have maybe a birth certificate or something inside. And they\u0027re writing to someone, here\u0027s your daughter\u0027s birth certificate. You can take care of the kids. I\u0027m leaving. Or people breaking engagements--",
            "They\u0027re in Washington. And they\u0027re far away from this facility. Some of them have never worked on a workroom floor. These people that are in charge of-- the Postmaster General, I don\u0027t believe, has ever been a postal employee. So they don\u0027t have any concept of what goes on in the system. The sad part is even if those people came here physically, they just-- I hate to say it, my opinion-- I don\u0027t think they would care. And that is sad for the customer and it\u0027s sad for the employee, because you take pride in your work and you want to do what\u0027s right for the customer. And these people are making decisions that are so illogical."

            "Even with all these people making all this effort, only 10% of the packages and 30% of the letters that come into the Mail Recovery Center are successfully sent on. With some items, there\u0027s just no way to get them to their destination. There\u0027s no address, no return address, nothing at all. But then there are other items that maybe could be returned if you were willing to put the kind of effort into it that Ken [? Grolkey ?] did with the Christmas photos.",
            "The question is, is it worth it? And that\u0027s when the job gets tricky, deciding what\u0027s worth sending on and what\u0027s not. Greg Hawthorne is the acting supervisor on the day shift. He\u0027s management. He\u0027s not actually in there, dealing with the mail every day. And so, maybe a little predictably, when I ask him how you decide what gets sent back, he tells me that you go by the book.",
            "What that someone, somewhere decided was essentially what out of everything that we put in the mail is most valuable? Well, here\u0027s what the regulations say. Checks, they always get sent back. Legal papers, stock certificates, those get returned. With personal letters though, the basic rule is that if there\u0027s something worth $10 or more, that gets sent back, if it can. But everything else gets disposed of.",
            "That\u0027s Greg\u0027s version. But when I talk to the people who actually deal with the mail, I heard a different story. This is Anne [? Zeemer. ?]",
            "The reason for this difference of opinion is pretty simple. It\u0027s not that Greg is a by-the-book square and Anne is a rule-bending softie. It\u0027s not that Greg is management and Anne is labor. It\u0027s that Greg doesn\u0027t read other people\u0027s mail all day. And Anne, and Ken, and Lorinda, and all the other clerks I spoke to in St. Paul, they do. And that changes things. They\u0027re face to face every day with parts of our lives whose value is hard to quantify.",
            "This is Betty Jones.",
            "The clerks here say it\u0027s a strange experience to see into all of these lives. Strange, and not always happy. One day after work, Betty and I sat out behind the Mail Recovery Center, at a picnic table next to the loading docks. And we spoke for awhile about what that experience is like.",
            "Betty actually had to fight with the post office in order to keep her job at the Mail Recovery Center. She first came here in 1989, on a temporary basis after she developed carpal tunnel syndrome at her previous job sorting mail. But after five years, she was told that she couldn\u0027t work here anymore. They said that because of her injuries, she wasn\u0027t able to do the job. And that was despite the fact that she\u0027d been doing it successfully for years.",
            "She filed a grievance. And after a few months in limbo, she won her job back. And of all the people I talked to here, she\u0027s the one who seems to be the most affected by what she sees in the mail. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s because of everything that she had to go through to stay here, but I think it might be.",
            "I should say at this point that all of the clerks I spoke to, especially Betty, emphasized that they\u0027re not just diving into a pile of mail and reading through people\u0027s personal letters for curiosity\u0027s sake. They open first-class mail to look for items of value, things that are worth more than $10, like maybe some cash or a pin or some photos. And then they scan the letters. They don\u0027t read them, everyone told me. They scan them, looking for an address or a name or any information that might help get the letter to where it\u0027s supposed to go.",
            "I believe everyone who told me this. I don\u0027t think anyone at the Mail Recovery Center reads mail for any kind of voyeuristic thrill. But I also believe that, like everything at the Center, the reality is more complicated than the regulations. And when you\u0027ve just opened a letter from a child to her mother who\u0027s in prison, or from a man writing to his dead wife, the human material in front of you is so incredible that you can\u0027t help but scan a little more slowly than is perhaps absolutely necessary.",
            "There are a lot of reasons why things end up at the Mail Recovery Center. Someone left an address off a letter, someone moved and didn\u0027t let anybody know, someone\u0027s envelope got wet and then the ink ran. For whatever reason, it ends up here.",
            "That feeling of personal connection that the clerks get from reading other people\u0027s mail is sometimes painful. But it\u0027s also precisely what makes mail recovery one of the most sought-after jobs in the post office. I didn\u0027t quite realize how sought-after a job it is, though, until I spoke one morning to Jerry Jacobson. He doesn\u0027t work at the Mail Recovery Center. He works for the union in Saint Paul that represents these workers. But before he got his union job, he spent 12 years working as a postal clerk, sorting letters. And he told me that about half the people who work in the post office work out of sight of the public, in warehouses, where they operate the giant machines that sort the nation\u0027s mail.",
            "Almost everyone I interviewed that worked at the Mail Recovery Center had spent at least a few years on a letter sorting machine, punching in 60 codes a minute, eight hours a day. Ken did it. Lorinda did it. Betty did it. That\u0027s how she got carpal tunnel syndrome. No one I talked to looked back on those years with much fondness.",
            "But the people who work at the St. Paul Mail Recovery Center may, in fact, soon have to go back to the mail sorting jobs that they escaped. When I visited, everybody was talking about this proposal that had just been floated that would shut the Center down in just a few months. No one\u0027s sure now whether it\u0027s really going to happen. Information\u0027s hard to come by, even for people that work there. But next October, the post office\u0027s board of governors is going to meet to discuss the Center\u0027s future. And they might decide to shut it down for good.",
            "A lot of the people I spoke to in St. Paul saw this as a symptom of larger changes that are going on in the post office. A few years ago, there were seven Mail Recovery Centers around the country. Now there are three. And there\u0027s talk of closing another one soon. The reason is that the people in charge of the post office have, over the past few years, been concentrating more and more on cost cutting, and that means automation. Every part of the post office, from letter sorting to delivery, and even to mail recovery, is becoming more automated. The result is that postal workers, the ones I spoke to anyway, feel less and less valuable to the people in charge.",
            "I think it was you, Betty, who said that if the people at the top really knew what was going on in here, knew what sort of work people were doing in here, they wouldn\u0027t be trying to close it. What is it that they don\u0027t know?",
            "The great thing about the Mail Recovery Center is this, you\u0027ve got this vast machine called the United States Postal Service, which is becoming more and more automated, less and less human. And then here in this little out-of-the-way warehouse on an access road in St. Paul, you\u0027ve got 75 people who are doing work that takes brains and heart, that makes them fulfilled, and makes the people they serve happy. It\u0027s like the land that time forgot.",
            "And a lot of it ends up here. There are 150,000 pieces of mail that arrive here each day. And the 75 people who work here all basically have the same job, to open up the mail, look inside, and see if they can figure out where it\u0027s supposed to go. And they see some pretty strange things, things that the rest of us don\u0027t. It\u0027s sort of a postal cross-section, a random sampling of what America mails. A clerk named Lauren [? Dicosad ?] told me about some of the things they find.",
            "One of the weird things about talking to the people at the MRC about the possibility that they might lose their jobs, was that they were upset about it. But they also seem kind of resigned to it. It\u0027s like they knew that they were out of step with the new go-go, super-automated post office. It\u0027s like they felt that they\u0027ve been getting away with something by having interesting jobs, and now they\u0027ve been found out.",
            "On the wall of the Mail Recovery Center are posted a slew of letters, mostly handwritten, from people who have had things returned to them. All the letters are filled with gratitude. And what\u0027s more, they all have this air of amazement to them. None of these people knew that this service even existed. And then suddenly, they got their insurance forms or their bank deposits or their engagement ring back. One letter that Greg Hawthorne showed me said, \"We want to let you know how much we appreciate you taking the time to find our Christmas gifts. You\u0027ve restored our faith in humanity.\" You have to wonder if 10 years from now, the post office will still be getting letters like that.",
            "[MUSIC - \"THE LETTER\" BY MEKONS]",

            "The goal is always to return lost mail, if it\u0027s possible. Sometimes it\u0027s not too hard. There\u0027s a check in the envelope and there\u0027s an address on the check. They send it back. Sometimes the person\u0027s moved and left no forwarding address. In that case, there are clerks who scan through these huge computer databases of names and addresses. And sometimes they can find a good address that way. Sometimes they have to resort to real detective work, like Ken [? Grolkey, ?] who\u0027s been working here for eight years."

We had 4/10 of a second to look at the mail, read the ZIP code or the address, decide where it was to go, and then the mail would take off. And as it was going into the machine, we had 6/10 of a second to key a series of buttons as far as a code or sequence for it. And then that was, of course, computerized.

The reason is that the people in charge of the post office have, over the past few years, been concentrating more and more on cost cutting, and that means automation.

            "As voyeurism goes, the shopping lists are harmless. All Phil is doing is trying to catch a glimpse of another human being in the most mundane series of nouns.",
            "Phil also collects those little pieces of paper you doodle on in art supply stores to try out the pens. And he claims that they, too, tell him something about the inner life of random strangers. But this collection is altogether more magical. Even though these scribblings were created by people trying to decide between BIC or Pilot Precise, they\u0027re done in very striking colors. And many of them look like fairly acceptable abstract art.",
            "We\u0027re kind of skating on the edge of something that some people devote their professional lives to. And I\u0027m flipping through this book. I mean, especially the abstract-- like you said the abstract ones are kind of the most beautiful. And flipping through, I think oh, there\u0027s Kandinsky, and there\u0027s Cy Twombly, and there is Jackson Pollock, and there is Helen Frankenthaler, or whatever. But it\u0027s not-- I mean, how has looking at these changed the way that you look at real art?",
            "If I could, I\u0027d like to just get a plug in here for Western civilization as we know it. I\u0027ve always been more interested in the things you need card catalogs to find than the stuff you just come across willy-nilly on the street. I like James Baldwin and Pablo Picasso and Sonic Youth.",
            "Is that it with you? I mean do you really think you just have low standards? I mean, what do you see as the common theme of the things you collect?",
            "What bothers you about excellence?",
            "Hold it right there, buddy. There is something indecent about the entire premise of this week\u0027s show.",
            "But, I mean, we\u0027re sitting in this room next to your record collection, and I\u0027m looking at it, and I\u0027m like, there are the Stooges, who I think are great. There\u0027s Little Richard, whom some days is my favorite singer. I mean, this room is wall-to-wall greatness.",
            "These are the kinds of records Phil listens to these days. They\u0027re called song poems. They\u0027re written by amateurs who answered ads in magazines asking for song lyrics, and studio hacks set their words to music for a fee. Phil doesn\u0027t just collect them. He\u0027s compiled four CDs of them and is writing a book about the phenomenon.",
            "This particular one is called \"Elvis,\" by someone named Pauleen D. Wassilchak. And while it has its charms, I don\u0027t think Iggy Popp has anything to worry about.",
            "[MUSIC - \"ELVIS\" BY PAULINE D. WASSILCHAK]",
            "Phil\u0027s most morally questionable collection is the bag full of a college student\u0027s love letters to her boyfriend. Not only has Phil read her letters, he\u0027s published them in a zine called Rollerderby, and put them up on the World Wide Web. Most of the letters are pretty saccharin, beyond banal. Many of them are written on cutesy, teddy-bear greeting cards. And no, because of that apostrophe I mentioned earlier, you won\u0027t be hearing this woman\u0027s secret thoughts on the air. This is a private correspondence. And even Phil can\u0027t justify his claims on it.",
            "It was at this moment that I noticed that all the shades in Phil\u0027s apartment were drawn. He doesn\u0027t want other people, people like him, to look in. I tried to make light of it. But every time I asked him a question as a joke, he responded point-blank, for real. Yes, he has binoculars. Yes, he uses them to peep into windows. Yes, he\u0027d watch you having sex and better yet, getting killed. And yes, he\u0027s seen Rear Window, six times.",
            "And no, he doesn\u0027t want other people, people like him, to read his mail. So he\u0027s considering buying a paper shredder. They\u0027re coming down in price, you know.",
            "The title says it all, Other People\u0027s Mail. There\u0027s an apostrophe stuck on to that word, people. Now, I know that it\u0027s small and you could miss it pretty easily. But there\u0027s a world of meaning packed into that teensy little mark. It connotes the possessive case. And maybe I\u0027m being too literal, but the apostrophe draws a line between your stuff and someone else\u0027s.",
            "Alternative titles I\u0027ve considered for this, the Other People\u0027s Mail show, are None Of Your Bee\u0027s Wax, or I Got One Word For You, Gestapo, or Hey You, Get Out Of My Trash. I don\u0027t mean to sound self-righteous. Sure, what human being can resist reading over her neighbor\u0027s shoulder in the subway or looking in someone\u0027s window, if it\u0027s all lit up. But I\u0027d like to think that in a democracy, in This American Life, Mr. Glass, the words personal and private still mean something.",
            "Still, I have a job to do. And my job is not to prejudge, but to evaluate fair and square. So I went to Boston, as assigned, to visit Phil Milstein. He works as a graphic designer and lives in a normal apartment, filled with an abnormal number of shelves. He\u0027s a serious collector of other people\u0027s stuff, not just their mail-- crumpled notes he finds on the street, pieces of gum chewed by minor celebrities, and grocery shopping lists, which he scoops off the supermarket floor and pastes into scrapbooks.",
            "And they forgot to capitalize Lysol, because that is a proper name."

I find it more interesting and more revealing than classical art or self-conscious art, art created as art. It\u0027s hard. You have to really think.

And it makes me-- because deep down I want to be able to do great things, but I\u0027ve never really been able to. So there is an unfulfilled desire that I\u0027m forced to confront every time I see something great. In myself I just say, wow, that\u0027s above anything I could ever do.
