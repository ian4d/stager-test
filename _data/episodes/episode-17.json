        "I\u0027ve often thought there are strong analogies to be drawn between the queer community\u0027s politics of sexual preference and the fan community\u0027s politics of cultural preference. From the point of view of mundane culture, both groups provoke discomfort concerning their scandalous taste and shocking behavior. One often hears people speak of \"coming out\" as a fan or \"being closeted\" at work. Fans often hide their cultural preferences, afraid of what their office mates might think about their hobbies, their friends, their creative accomplishments, or how they spend their weekends. I\u0027ve known many fans who\u0027ve had to hide fanzines from unsympathetic eyes or lie to their spouses about going to a convention.",
        "And most of us have been snickered at and subjected to endless harangues in the popular media. We have our own terminological disputes, rejecting the outsider term \"Trekkie,\" with its historic ties to groupie, for the insider term \"Trekker,\" with its positive connotations of active participation. That\u0027s why many of us automatically cringed when we saw pictures of the Whitewater juror in her Starfleet uniform.",
        "It seems to me that an awful lot of what we do in the fan community has strong parallels with some of the debates that occur in the communities surrounding gays and lesbians. There\u0027s a debate going on there right now that\u0027s often labeled \"the place at the table debate\" because it grows out of Bruce Bowers\u0027 book A Place at the Table. The central issue is, on the gay community, on the one hand, Bower is arguing that gays should assimilate, that they should downplay transgressive behaviors.",
        "They should mainstream themselves. Exactly. They shouldn\u0027t be parading around in drag, or in leather on Gay Pride parades, and so forth. That they should try to fit in, and then they might gain acceptance that way.",
        "The problem, of course, is that that pushes the queer community into doing the dirty work for the family values folks. You seek acceptance by policing your own ranks and by saying what\u0027s normal and what\u0027s not. And the argument goes that one\u0027s only free as a community when even the most extreme behavior is allowed to express itself. And I think if we read the fan\u0027s behavior by those standards, that is, as an expression of her cultural preferences, then we have to defend her right to wear the uniform and respect the courage in confronting the public ridicule that surrounded her action.",
        "Her choice represents a new kind of fan identity politics, as you would, that we\u0027re tired of being told by William Shatner and others to get a life. We\u0027re tired of being stereotyped as living in our parents\u0027 basement. In fact, we are a wide variety of people who happen to believe in the cultural power of television and of all art to change the way we think about the universe.",
        "So what\u0027s exciting about the fan\u0027s behavior is that she wasn\u0027t afraid. She didn\u0027t hide. She asserted very publicly who she was and what her commitments were. And I see it as striking a blow for the dignity of fans, particularly given how thoughtful, moderate, and articulate she happened to be.",
        "When I first saw it, I did. But as I started to think through this issue, I started to think, \"Why am I cringing? Why am I ashamed?\" I\u0027ve written two books on Star Trek fan culture. I have a very strong commitment to the idea that it is one of the important participatory cultures of our time, that it is one way people have of talking back to television, of taking control of their own lives, and creating their own culture from the materials they borrow from the mass media. So I shouldn\u0027t be ashamed, in fact, to see it projected even in the most public and political of spaces.",
        "Well, I think increasingly it means what it is to be an American in this digital age, that is, if we look at-- Harris tells us that more than 53% of the American public consider themselves to be Star Trek fans. That means an awful lot of those are not people who wear rubber Spock ears and overly tight velour uniforms, that they are people who represent the full range of American life. And as we begin to move online as a society, it seems abundantly clear that television fandom becomes a central motivation that gets people to participate in the digital realm, that is, what are we going to talk about when we go online and have the possibility of talking to people from around the country and around the world?",
        "We\u0027re not going to talk about my aunt Agatha who you and the people in Chicago have never heard of before. We\u0027re going to talk about people, and images, and stories that we share in common. And those images, in all likelihood, are going to come from national or even internationally circulated shows like Star Trek. So the point is that national media provides the fan community with a way of telling its own stories, of framing its own identities which allows it to speak to each other across all kinds of isolation we face as a society.",
        "Now the most interesting aspect of the story is not that she wore her uniform to the court, but that she got selected despite, or perhaps even because, she wore the uniform. Jury selection in a high-profile case like Whitewater has become an increasingly exact science. Experts make recommendations to lawyers based on a body of stereotypes about how different social groups are likely to respond to certain kinds of cases or arguments. Blacks are good for the defense, white men are good for the prosecution, and so forth.",
        "But there probably never needed to be a grid for fans as a social group before. So what stereotypes of fans did the experts draw upon in assessing this particular juror? When I first saw her picture in the paper, as she was awaiting jury selection, my immediate response was that she\u0027d never get picked. Neither the prosecution nor the defense would find her acceptable because, as a Trekker, she would be seen as too aberrant, too unpredictable, too abnormal and excessive. Instead, I suspect a different stereotype clicked into place, the notion that fans are gullible, easily led, easily manipulated. Both sets of lawyers probably thought that they could control her with their rhetoric. After all, if she can\u0027t tell the difference between a TV show and real life, she\u0027s a pushover for whatever arguments they wanted to make.",
        "The woman we saw interviewed on television news, however, fits neither stereotype. She was thoughtful, moderate, and articulate. She also happens to be a Star Trek fan. Get used to it. The whole case is, as Mr. Spock would say, fascinating."

Apparently, I was the border guard in ancient Celtic Ireland.",
        "And lo, who should appear on the other side of this mass of barbed wire and steel, but my namesake, Saint Patrick. \"Saint Patrick,\" I cried out. \"Well, this is a fine how-do-you do. They were just booing me at your parade in Chicago the other day, hissing and--\" And then old Saint Patrick interrupted me. \"I have come to be the bishop of your land.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know, Saint,\" I replied. \"Where were you born?\" \"Britain. In Britain.\"",
        "\"Oh, no, well, Mr. Rick, we got laws, constitutional amendments preventing aliens like yourself, your saintship, from becoming citizens or getting any of King MacNeil\u0027s handouts to the peasantry.

We don\u0027t want the Germanesses telling us what to do, Germanist generals under the UN flag, directing our soldiers in some Bosnian quagmire half a world away.

        "\"Oh no,\" I replied, \"chase the snakes? Heavens to Betsy. If you banish the snakes, they\u0027ll just show up in repressed forms in our dreams. Why, here\u0027s one crawling up my leg now.\" And at this point, just when my phantasm was threatening to become a goofy metadream, the action suddenly shifted in that crazy way dreams go, shifted to the present. And I heard the strains of my campaign theme song.",
        "[MUSIC - \"WE WILL ROCK YOU\" BY QUEEN]",
        "There I was, sitting with my friends and advisers, Larry Pratt, and Samuel Francis, and John Lofton, and the Reverend Donald Wildmon, talking about where my campaign should go from here, which is funny that it was those guys in the dream. Because those are the ones that have gotten me into hot water with the media because-- well, let\u0027s just say those fellas don\u0027t repress their beliefs. If they talked to some local militias about a war against the white race, or how the TV industry is made up of people raised in Jewish homes, or about promiscuous homosexuals literally hell-bent on Satanism and suicide, well, they\u0027re just being frank, which is a lot more than we can expect from Beltway insiders like that parrot the Bobster or Bill Clinton chasing issues like a blind dog in a meat market.",
        "Anyway, in the dream, we were talking about my options, the boys and I, the three paths diverging in a red, white, and blue wood. To be the good party boy, like I was in \u002792, support the leading candidate? To swoop down like a B-2 Bombardier on San Diego in August with a whooping religious war cry against the murder of the unborn? Or to go the Wallace way, bolt the party that made me, and make my own?",
        "But this being a dream, things started to metamorphize. Lofton\u0027s head split open, and the head of my old boss, Richard Nixon, sprouted from his shoulders in a bloody bloom of scatological curses. \"Never leave the expletive deleted party, Patty Joe.\" His jowls flapped like sails in a squall. \"I stood by Ike. I stood by Barry.\" But I was distracted as my other three friends burst from their own bodies like soggy-winged gypsy moths from their crystalline, becoming animatronic incarnations of my father\u0027s trio of heroes, General MacArthur, Joe McCarthy, and Francisco Franco. \"I couldn\u0027t beat Ike in \u002752,\" thundered MacArthur, \"but I gave him hell at the Convention.\" Franco, of course, was for his militant, third-party approach. Senator Joe was checking under my sofa for Reds.",
        "But the whole architecture of the dream transmuted then, and I was in the future. About 2010 or so, touring college campuses and \u002790s nostalgia theme parks in some virtual entertainment called \"The Three Pats,\" which was me, Pat Robertson, and Pat Boone. My buddy Robertson recited various apocalyptic folk tales of his own devising, all of which involved earthquakes, tidal waves, and neo-liberal Democratic presidents with bisexual wives, whose stints as Peace Corps volunteers in India made them acolytes of Shiva and eventually transformed them into the anti-Christ. And Pat Boone.",
        "This being a virtual entertainment of the future, I\u0027m not sure if Pat Boone was alive or merely a hologramistic image existing within the light-emitting diodes rubber cemented to the undersides of my eyelids. But there he was, clean cut in white bucks, singing a rendition of his 1956 chart topper, \"I Almost Lost My Mind,\" along with a smattering of selections from his fine Gospel albums. And then I came on, the main act, sounding all the themes I\u0027ve been sounding in this here campaign, issues I feel deeply about.",
        "I think of my father raised in poverty, but who, through hard work, was able to provide for his family. Now men like my father are finding no outlet for their hard work, their ideals, their faith in America. I told them how the Ruth Ginsburgs Bader Jose to keep leipzigging our fences and gutentagging our buildings with his Symbionese gang symbology, tacoing handouts and living off welfare, yum yum chow, giving birth to Young Phat [? Taht ?] at taxpayer expense, sashiming his way into our high techamaki jobs, while our boys in the military have to strap on the Helmut Kohl of the United heathen Nations and fight for the Turkish delight of Rabin hoods and radical sheiks.",
        "As my futuristic audience chortled and hiccuped derision into the biogenically filtered air of the campus mediatorium, I realized that I had become a parody of myself. Our act, The Three Pats, was being presented with the same camp intentions as when they were trotting out Timothy Leary and Gordon Liddy in mock debates a few years back. Now I am not a man who\u0027s prone to self-doubt. I am my own catechism.",
        "But maybe it\u0027s the beating I\u0027ve been taking lately even from men who I considered to be my friends, Bill Buckley, Bill Sapphire, George Will. They make the doubts pile up and spill over into dreams. Heck, I\u0027m the only one left in this campaign with firm beliefs and true convictions. And yet I fear becoming some comic footnote in the history of man\u0027s struggle to lift his world up closer to the Kingdom of God. My futuristic dream self gamely thundered on. But somehow, the honest Christian faith of three men named Patrick had become the 21st century\u0027s equivalent of The Brady Bunch movie today, a farce, a way of feeling superior to our former and better selves.",
        "I think I woke up then. I\u0027m not sure.

        "The first part, it was very green. Green grass everywhere, green grasses, rushes, and ferns. Puffins flying overhead. Druids leaned against dolmens, fashioning wreaths of mistletoe. I stood in front of an enormous electrified chain-link fence that went on and on, disappearing into the cloud-filled horizons both north and south. Apparently, I was the border guard in ancient Celtic Ireland.",
        "Anyway, in the dream, we were talking about my options, the boys and I, the three paths diverging in a red, white, and blue wood. To be the good party boy, like I was in \u002792, support the leading candidate? To swoop down like a B-2 Bombardier on San Diego in August with a whooping religious war cry against the murder of the unborn? Or to go the Wallace way, bolt the party that made me, and make my own?",
        "\"I bring the shamrock clover, whose three leaves represent the Holy Trinity.\"",
        "\"Oh no,\" I replied, \"chase the snakes? Heavens to Betsy. If you banish the snakes, they\u0027ll just show up in repressed forms in our dreams. Why, here\u0027s one crawling up my leg now.\" And at this point, just when my phantasm was threatening to become a goofy metadream, the action suddenly shifted in that crazy way dreams go, shifted to the present. And I heard the strains of my campaign theme song.",
        "And lo, who should appear on the other side of this mass of barbed wire and steel, but my namesake, Saint Patrick. \"Saint Patrick,\" I cried out. \"Well, this is a fine how-do-you do. They were just booing me at your parade in Chicago the other day, hissing and--\" And then old Saint Patrick interrupted me. \"I have come to be the bishop of your land.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know, Saint,\" I replied. \"Where were you born?\" \"Britain. In Britain.\"",
        "There I was, sitting with my friends and advisers, Larry Pratt, and Samuel Francis, and John Lofton, and the Reverend Donald Wildmon, talking about where my campaign should go from here, which is funny that it was those guys in the dream. Because those are the ones that have gotten me into hot water with the media because-- well, let\u0027s just say those fellas don\u0027t repress their beliefs. If they talked to some local militias about a war against the white race, or how the TV industry is made up of people raised in Jewish homes, or about promiscuous homosexuals literally hell-bent on Satanism and suicide, well, they\u0027re just being frank, which is a lot more than we can expect from Beltway insiders like that parrot the Bobster or Bill Clinton chasing issues like a blind dog in a meat market.",
        "This being a virtual entertainment of the future, I\u0027m not sure if Pat Boone was alive or merely a hologramistic image existing within the light-emitting diodes rubber cemented to the undersides of my eyelids. But there he was, clean cut in white bucks, singing a rendition of his 1956 chart topper, \"I Almost Lost My Mind,\" along with a smattering of selections from his fine Gospel albums. And then I came on, the main act, sounding all the themes I\u0027ve been sounding in this here campaign, issues I feel deeply about.",
        "As my futuristic audience chortled and hiccuped derision into the biogenically filtered air of the campus mediatorium, I realized that I had become a parody of myself. Our act, The Three Pats, was being presented with the same camp intentions as when they were trotting out Timothy Leary and Gordon Liddy in mock debates a few years back. Now I am not a man who\u0027s prone to self-doubt. I am my own catechism.",
        "\"You don\u0027t understand. I bring with me the Latin Bible.\"",
        "\"Oh, no, well, Mr. Rick, we got laws, constitutional amendments preventing aliens like yourself, your saintship, from becoming citizens or getting any of King MacNeil\u0027s handouts to the peasantry. You see, we got too many foreigners coming in, taking our jobs, choice jobs, like that bishopry you\u0027re angling for.\"",
        "\"But it is God who has sent me here,\" replied poor Saint Patrick in my dream, \"to chase the snakes from your land.\"",
        "I think of my father raised in poverty, but who, through hard work, was able to provide for his family. Now men like my father are finding no outlet for their hard work, their ideals, their faith in America. I told them how the Ruth Ginsburgs Bader Jose to keep leipzigging our fences and gutentagging our buildings with his Symbionese gang symbology, tacoing handouts and living off welfare, yum yum chow, giving birth to Young Phat [? Taht ?] at taxpayer expense, sashiming his way into our high techamaki jobs, while our boys in the military have to strap on the Helmut Kohl of the United heathen Nations and fight for the Turkish delight of Rabin hoods and radical sheiks.",
        "But maybe it\u0027s the beating I\u0027ve been taking lately even from men who I considered to be my friends, Bill Buckley, Bill Sapphire, George Will. They make the doubts pile up and spill over into dreams. Heck, I\u0027m the only one left in this campaign with firm beliefs and true convictions. And yet I fear becoming some comic footnote in the history of man\u0027s struggle to lift his world up closer to the Kingdom of God. My futuristic dream self gamely thundered on. But somehow, the honest Christian faith of three men named Patrick had become the 21st century\u0027s equivalent of The Brady Bunch movie today, a farce, a way of feeling superior to our former and better selves.",
        "\"You don\u0027t understand. I was named, ordained by Saint Germanus himself to lead the Irish people.\"",
        "While the Clintons and Doles check the contingencies and polls before every public utterance, I\u0027m utterly straight with my public. I don\u0027t repress, so I don\u0027t dream. Except last night. It was the oddest thing. I dreamt of myself, but myself in the past, and in the present, and in the future.",
        "But this being a dream, things started to metamorphize. Lofton\u0027s head split open, and the head of my old boss, Richard Nixon, sprouted from his shoulders in a bloody bloom of scatological curses. \"Never leave the expletive deleted party, Patty Joe.\" His jowls flapped like sails in a squall. \"I stood by Ike. I stood by Barry.\" But I was distracted as my other three friends burst from their own bodies like soggy-winged gypsy moths from their crystalline, becoming animatronic incarnations of my father\u0027s trio of heroes, General MacArthur, Joe McCarthy, and Francisco Franco. \"I couldn\u0027t beat Ike in \u002752,\" thundered MacArthur, \"but I gave him hell at the Convention.\" Franco, of course, was for his militant, third-party approach. Senator Joe was checking under my sofa for Reds.",
        "But the whole architecture of the dream transmuted then, and I was in the future. About 2010 or so, touring college campuses and \u002790s nostalgia theme parks in some virtual entertainment called \"The Three Pats,\" which was me, Pat Robertson, and Pat Boone. My buddy Robertson recited various apocalyptic folk tales of his own devising, all of which involved earthquakes, tidal waves, and neo-liberal Democratic presidents with bisexual wives, whose stints as Peace Corps volunteers in India made them acolytes of Shiva and eventually transformed them into the anti-Christ. And Pat Boone.",
        "\"Trinity? We don\u0027t want trilaterialism here, Senor Saint. You\u0027re talking new world order, IMF, World Court, World Bank, Goldman Sachs with their sacks of gold. This here is a sovereign nation under God.\"",
        "[MUSIC - \"WE WILL ROCK YOU\" BY QUEEN]",
        "\"Oh now, well, that\u0027s the problem. We don\u0027t want the Germanesses telling us what to do, Germanist generals under the UN flag, directing our soldiers in some Bosnian quagmire half a world away. We built up the factories and infrastructures of the Germanesses and the Yamomotos And now what are we looking at? $200 billion trade deficit.\""

            "Act One, Pier Pressure. Well, last week on this program, as one of our stories about the state of the nation\u0027s economy, we did a report about Chicago\u0027s Navy Pier, what it cost taxpayers, and what they got out of it. It cost-- if you did not hear our show-- $155 million in taxpayers\u0027 money and created, at most, 1,200 jobs, about half of those part-time. That\u0027s $130,000 per job.",
            "A spokesman for the city said that we should judge the pier by the pleasure that it gives Chicagoans and the overall boost that it gives to tourism, not by the cost per job created. But in our report, we also took pains to point out that, by all accounts, the pier has been a huge, huge business success. Crowds are twice as big as anyone projected. Over 3 million people in the first six months. The stores and restaurants on the pier say that they\u0027re doing well by and large.",
            "But two days after our broadcast, the news broke that Navy Pier is, in fact, losing money, at least the city agency that runs the pier is. And they\u0027re losing a lot of money. $9 million in the pier\u0027s first eight months of business. Because of this, Navy Pier has announced that it will lay off one-fourth of its full-time staff and do other cost cutting.",
            "We have put in several requests over the course of this week to speak with the head of the pier, James Reilly, or another pier spokesperson. We wanted to ask what was going wrong. How could they be doing such gangbuster business and still lose money? With over 3 million visitors, the city is losing $2 to $3 per visitor. And this at a place that charges $16 to park.",
            "All this week, the public relations office at Navy Pier has promised an interview. But in the end, this did not happen. The closest we can get to finding out why the pier is losing all this money is in Crain\u0027s Chicago Business. There, the head of the Pier Authority, Mr. Reilly, said the losses had to do with opening delays and what the paper called \"first year inefficiencies.\" It did not go into details.",

When I came into work after the story aired, one of my fellow staffers here at Chicago\u0027s public radio station, this was Aaron Freeman, told me that in our coverage about the economics of Navy Pier, we had missed the main point of what makes the pier so worthwhile to Chicago taxpayers. And at the end of the workday, he loaded his two twin girls into their special wide-load double stroller. The radio station is located midway down Navy Pier. And we headed out into the promenade, so he could show me what he was talking about.",

As Aaron expounded on how wonderful all this was, I should note for the record that his two small children were not particularly enchanted. It was the end of the day. They were tired in a way that even $155 million of taxpayers\u0027 money cannot alter or change. As politicians like to say these days, there are some problems that government can\u0027t solve no matter how much money it throws at them. Diana slept, Artemis was cranky, jumping fountains or not.",

Well, last week on this program, as one of our stories about the state of the nation\u0027s economy, we did a report about Chicago\u0027s Navy Pier, what it cost taxpayers, and what they got out of it. It cost-- if you did not hear our show-- $155 million in taxpayers\u0027 money and created, at most, 1,200 jobs, about half of those part-time. That\u0027s $130,000 per job."

But in our report, we also took pains to point out that, by all accounts, the pier has been a huge, huge business success. Crowds are twice as big as anyone projected. Over 3 million people in the first six months. The stores and restaurants on the pier say that they\u0027re doing well by and large."

            "I\u0027ve often thought there are strong analogies to be drawn between the queer community\u0027s politics of sexual preference and the fan community\u0027s politics of cultural preference. From the point of view of mundane culture, both groups provoke discomfort concerning their scandalous taste and shocking behavior. One often hears people speak of \"coming out\" as a fan or \"being closeted\" at work. Fans often hide their cultural preferences, afraid of what their office mates might think about their hobbies, their friends, their creative accomplishments, or how they spend their weekends. I\u0027ve known many fans who\u0027ve had to hide fanzines from unsympathetic eyes or lie to their spouses about going to a convention.",
            "And most of us have been snickered at and subjected to endless harangues in the popular media. We have our own terminological disputes, rejecting the outsider term \"Trekkie,\" with its historic ties to groupie, for the insider term \"Trekker,\" with its positive connotations of active participation. That\u0027s why many of us automatically cringed when we saw pictures of the Whitewater juror in her Starfleet uniform.",
            "It seems to me that an awful lot of what we do in the fan community has strong parallels with some of the debates that occur in the communities surrounding gays and lesbians. There\u0027s a debate going on there right now that\u0027s often labeled \"the place at the table debate\" because it grows out of Bruce Bowers\u0027 book A Place at the Table. The central issue is, on the gay community, on the one hand, Bower is arguing that gays should assimilate, that they should downplay transgressive behaviors.",
            "They should mainstream themselves. Exactly. They shouldn\u0027t be parading around in drag, or in leather on Gay Pride parades, and so forth. That they should try to fit in, and then they might gain acceptance that way.",
            "The problem, of course, is that that pushes the queer community into doing the dirty work for the family values folks. You seek acceptance by policing your own ranks and by saying what\u0027s normal and what\u0027s not. And the argument goes that one\u0027s only free as a community when even the most extreme behavior is allowed to express itself. And I think if we read the fan\u0027s behavior by those standards, that is, as an expression of her cultural preferences, then we have to defend her right to wear the uniform and respect the courage in confronting the public ridicule that surrounded her action.",
            "Her choice represents a new kind of fan identity politics, as you would, that we\u0027re tired of being told by William Shatner and others to get a life. We\u0027re tired of being stereotyped as living in our parents\u0027 basement. In fact, we are a wide variety of people who happen to believe in the cultural power of television and of all art to change the way we think about the universe.",
            "So what\u0027s exciting about the fan\u0027s behavior is that she wasn\u0027t afraid. She didn\u0027t hide. She asserted very publicly who she was and what her commitments were. And I see it as striking a blow for the dignity of fans, particularly given how thoughtful, moderate, and articulate she happened to be.",
            "When I first saw it, I did. But as I started to think through this issue, I started to think, \"Why am I cringing? Why am I ashamed?\" I\u0027ve written two books on Star Trek fan culture. I have a very strong commitment to the idea that it is one of the important participatory cultures of our time, that it is one way people have of talking back to television, of taking control of their own lives, and creating their own culture from the materials they borrow from the mass media. So I shouldn\u0027t be ashamed, in fact, to see it projected even in the most public and political of spaces.",
            "Well, I think increasingly it means what it is to be an American in this digital age, that is, if we look at-- Harris tells us that more than 53% of the American public consider themselves to be Star Trek fans. That means an awful lot of those are not people who wear rubber Spock ears and overly tight velour uniforms, that they are people who represent the full range of American life. And as we begin to move online as a society, it seems abundantly clear that television fandom becomes a central motivation that gets people to participate in the digital realm, that is, what are we going to talk about when we go online and have the possibility of talking to people from around the country and around the world?",
            "We\u0027re not going to talk about my aunt Agatha who you and the people in Chicago have never heard of before.

Experts make recommendations to lawyers based on a body of stereotypes about how different social groups are likely to respond to certain kinds of cases or arguments. Blacks are good for the defense, white men are good for the prosecution, and so forth.",
            "But there probably never needed to be a grid for fans as a social group before. So what stereotypes of fans did the experts draw upon in assessing this particular juror? When I first saw her picture in the paper, as she was awaiting jury selection, my immediate response was that she\u0027d never get picked. Neither the prosecution nor the defense would find her acceptable because, as a Trekker, she would be seen as too aberrant, too unpredictable, too abnormal and excessive.

Both sets of lawyers probably thought that they could control her with their rhetoric. After all, if she can\u0027t tell the difference between a TV show and real life, she\u0027s a pushover for whatever arguments they wanted to make.",

            "The problem, of course, is that that pushes the queer community into doing the dirty work for the family values folks. You seek acceptance by policing your own ranks and by saying what\u0027s normal and what\u0027s not. And the argument goes that one\u0027s only free as a community when even the most extreme behavior is allowed to express itself. And I think if we read the fan\u0027s behavior by those standards, that is, as an expression of her cultural preferences, then we have to defend her right to wear the uniform and respect the courage in confronting the public ridicule that surrounded her action.",
            "And most of us have been snickered at and subjected to endless harangues in the popular media. We have our own terminological disputes, rejecting the outsider term \"Trekkie,\" with its historic ties to groupie, for the insider term \"Trekker,\" with its positive connotations of active participation. That\u0027s why many of us automatically cringed when we saw pictures of the Whitewater juror in her Starfleet uniform.",

And I see it as striking a blow for the dignity of fans, particularly given how thoughtful, moderate, and articulate she happened to be.",
            "It seems to me that an awful lot of what we do in the fan community has strong parallels with some of the debates that occur in the communities surrounding gays and lesbians. There\u0027s a debate going on there right now that\u0027s often labeled \"the place at the table debate\" because it grows out of Bruce Bowers\u0027 book A Place at the Table. The central issue is, on the gay community, on the one hand, Bower is arguing that gays should assimilate, that they should downplay transgressive behaviors.",
            "Well, I think increasingly it means what it is to be an American in this digital age, that is, if we look at-- Harris tells us that more than 53% of the American public consider themselves to be Star Trek fans. That means an awful lot of those are not people who wear rubber Spock ears and overly tight velour uniforms, that they are people who represent the full range of American life. And as we begin to move online as a society, it seems abundantly clear that television fandom becomes a central motivation that gets people to participate in the digital realm, that is, what are we going to talk about when we go online and have the possibility of talking to people from around the country and around the world?",
            "I\u0027ve often thought there are strong analogies to be drawn between the queer community\u0027s politics of sexual preference and the fan community\u0027s politics of cultural preference. From the point of view of mundane culture, both groups provoke discomfort concerning their scandalous taste and shocking behavior. One often hears people speak of \"coming out\" as a fan or \"being closeted\" at work. Fans often hide their cultural preferences, afraid of what their office mates might think about their hobbies, their friends, their creative accomplishments, or how they spend their weekends. I\u0027ve known many fans who\u0027ve had to hide fanzines from unsympathetic eyes or lie to their spouses about going to a convention.",

Why am I ashamed?\" I\u0027ve written two books on Star Trek fan culture. I have a very strong commitment to the idea that it is one of the important participatory cultures of our time, that it is one way people have of talking back to television, of taking control of their own lives, and creating their own culture from the materials they borrow from the mass media.

Neither the prosecution nor the defense would find her acceptable because, as a Trekker, she would be seen as too aberrant, too unpredictable, too abnormal and excessive. Instead, I suspect a different stereotype clicked into place, the notion that fans are gullible, easily led, easily manipulated. Both sets of lawyers probably thought that they could control her with their rhetoric.

Neither the prosecution nor the defense would find her acceptable because, as a Trekker, she would be seen as too aberrant, too unpredictable, too abnormal and excessive.
