A year ago in a nightclub in Miami, the 170-pound Frankie knocked out a guy weighing 260 with a right hand. He says the punch brought everyone to their feet, including a middle-aged dance club owner from Chicago named Ruben Pazmino.","That night, Ruben had a vision for his Tropicana Club, and it revolved around Frankie Cruz. Later that week, Frankie was on a plane to Chicago.","It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning at the Tropicana, a Latino nightclub that houses four bars, a VIP room, a restaurant, and a huge dance floor with a balcony. It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning and nearly a thousand people are packed inside on a Tuesday. After the weightlifting contest and after the lip syncing and after the four erotic dancers finish massaging a shirtless man with baby oil, there\u0027s boxing in a regulation ring set up in the middle of the dance floor. It\u0027s fight night, and the star is walking in the door. It\u0027s Frankie.","Hip and beautiful Latinas turn to look at the 5 foot 10 Nicaraguan born fighter with dyed blond hair and a broken nose. He\u0027s not yet dressed in his boxing gear. Instead he wears a mustard-colored sports coat, slacks, and so much jewelry that he literally makes noise when he moves.","Here\u0027s Frankie\u0027s job. Here\u0027s the job he left his kids and family for. It\u0027s free-for-all boxing. Anyone can fight. You can fight. I could fight. Anyone. All you have to do is sign a release form agreeing that if your nose breaks, teeth get punched out, or you end up with a mild concussion, you know it\u0027s your fault for being too drunk and easily encouraged by your friends to get into a boxing ring in the first place.","You can choose to fight your best friend, your nemesis, or you can take your chances and fight Frankie. If you knock down Frankie, you get $1,000 in cash or the mysterious grand prize. Everyone goes for the cash.","Frankie will fight anyone who signs up. Sometimes he\u0027s boxed five or six matches in one night, an incredible feat of endurance, something no pro boxer will ever do. And Frankie gets paid the same whether he fights one guy or five guys.","He\u0027s fought with one arm tied behind his back. He\u0027s fought three guys at once. He\u0027s fought, in all, 128 fights at the Tropicana. He\u0027s won 127.","Frankie won\u0027t say how much he gets paid, but it\u0027s not much. And he says he sends most of that money back to his ex-wife, his three children, and his grandmother in Miami. So he\u0027s broke all the time.","For the first seven months he was in Chicago, Frankie lived in a back room of the Tropicana. He also worked as a bouncer on the nights he wasn\u0027t boxing. So for days on end, Frankie never left the club. Sometimes on a Saturday or Sunday when the business offices were closed, Frankie would be locked inside and would have to wait for the Tropicana to open in order to leave.","He says he didn\u0027t mind it that much until Ruben, the owner, took his television set away in order to start up a new karaoke night.","Right now two African American guys from the audience have signed up to fight each other and are going at it in the ring. Both weigh well over 200 pounds. While they clumsily stumble around the ring, taking wide punches and falling against the ropes, the almost preteen-looking ring girls get instructions on what they\u0027re supposed to do when Frankie re-enters the ring.","The girls in thong bikinis hustle around as Frankie emerges, now wearing a blue and gold running suit, a straw cowboy hat, and a Nicaraguan scarf tied around his neck.","Frankie stands with the announcer while the two ring girls walk in circles, each holding an end of his championship belt. The belt always gets the center spotlight.","When training, Frankie lays the belt down next to his treadmill, says a prayer, and starts running. It\u0027s on the floor next to him when he\u0027s jumping rope.","Once when I showed up to interview him at his gym, before we could go off to talk, he opened his gym bag and pulled out a little plastic stand that you use for picture frames. He put the stand on a desk facing the front door of the gym and put the belt on it.","On one end of the belt is Frankie\u0027s name. On the other, Viva Auto Sales Park because unfortunately, the Tropicana didn\u0027t give him the belt. For several months Frankie says, he continually asked Ruben for one but kept getting blown off.","Instead, a friend introduced Frankie to the owner of Viva Auto Sales. The guy agreed to buy the belt for Frankie if he could put the Viva name on it. It\u0027s a good investment. You meet Frankie, you meet the belt.","Leaving the belt with the ring girls, Frankie climbs between the ropes and gets in his corner. His managers, Danny and Hank, are there with him. They\u0027re grooming him to go pro in June. They give him a place to live. They see that he eats right, doesn\u0027t drink, and trains every day.","Frankie\u0027s opponent doesn\u0027t look too intimidating. Staggering, he enters the ring wearing jeans, a long sleeve green shirt, and Doc Martens. He\u0027s at least 240 pounds, complete with overhanging gut and love handles. It would take a lot of alcohol to make someone like this believe he belongs in a ring with a trained Olympic medalist. But he\u0027s had a lot of alcohol.","Hank and Danny size up the guy. The fact that he\u0027s drunk means his fighting may be sloppy. But it also makes it harder on Frankie because the drunks don\u0027t feel the pain as much. As the bell goes off, Hank screams instructions from the corner.","Frankie\u0027s splayed against the ropes. In a shocking move, Frankie\u0027s opponent came racing out of the corner and immediately began swinging. It\u0027s a barfighter\u0027s tactic, get in the first punch. He gets Frankie up against the ropes in the corner and on the defense, as Frankie only manages to get in a few body jabs.","It never occurred to me how hard Frankie would have to work to win his fights, how much of a beating he takes. He looks tired and confused.","At the end of the first round, Hank and Danny counsel Frankie in the corner. Mostly it\u0027s a big pep talk. You\u0027re the champ, they yell. You\u0027re the champ.","In round two, Frankie comes back. His opponent\u0027s punches becomes weaker. At times they miss Frankie completely. And almost gently, Frankie edges the guy up against the ropes in his own corner and does combinations to his head, pounds away at him. Blood spurts everywhere.","It\u0027s an incredible moment, satisfying in a way I never would have guessed. Sweat and spit fly off Frankie\u0027s body. Hank and Danny go wild. The crowd goes wild. Frankie breaks the guy\u0027s nose and the ref ends the fight.","When Frankie staggers back and drops his hands, blood drips from his gloves onto the starched, white mat. Hank screams at him.","Boxing can make you feel so small. The force of the punches is so brutal and penetrating that it\u0027s almost mythical. When Frankie climbed out of the ring, he asked me if I was impressed. I couldn\u0027t even answer. I couldn\u0027t talk to him.","In only a few minutes, this guy who has to beg for a belt from a used car dealership suddenly seemed untouchable.","I\u0027ve asked Frankie over and over what he loves about boxing, and he doesn\u0027t really say anything. He doesn\u0027t like hurting people. He doesn\u0027t have any romantic ideas about the tradition of boxing or its primal appeal. That\u0027s not why he boxes. It\u0027s a job. A job that doesn\u0027t pay all that much in grimy, punishing, working conditions. A job that he\u0027s good at, but that doesn\u0027t hold a lot of mystery anymore. The one thing that makes it special for Frankie is the crowds.","After his match, Frankie begins jumping around, running through the crowds up to the top floor of the nightclub, looking for fans. He does this every time, Hank says. When Frankie sees me, he stops and motions for me to follow, so I can record how much the crowd loves him.","Out of the ring looking for attention, Frankie doesn\u0027t seem like a giant anymore. He\u0027s a guy, boyish even.","A lot of people come over and shake his hand, say a word. A lot more push right by him, heading down to the ring where six women from the audience are now taking part in a do-it-yourself strip tease. Men in the audience pull dollar bills from their wallets and shove past. They don\u0027t look at Frankie.","[MEN CHANT \"TAKE IT OFF\"]"],"spokenWords":["Here\u0027s Frankie\u0027s job.

So you run and you run and you run and you hope that you never get caught. And then, if you do get caught, you get a beating on the head. It\u0027s more humiliating than it is hurtful. But at some point you decide, well, I\u0027m not going to be the guy being chased in the playground. I\u0027m going to do the chasing. It\u0027s as much to avoid the humiliation of having to run away as it is really enjoying doling it out. Although you quickly learn to enjoy being a bully.","Yeah, I thought if you can choose to be the guy throwing the beating, then you might as well be that guy instead of the guy getting the beating.","The things that I learned early on were you prepare for a fight way ahead of time. If you\u0027re going to go out at night, you wear big shoes because you end up on the floor getting dragged around and sometimes you have to kick people. Always throw the first punch. Punch in the throat and the eyes, the nuts, and the knees. Don\u0027t bother with any other part of the body if you want to win the fight. Never tell anybody you\u0027re going to fight them. Just punch them.","It\u0027s important to be the guy who can throw the punch to me. And it\u0027s more important than whether or not you win the fights or not, I think. But it\u0027s a hard thing to do, to throw a punch. Because you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen afterwards. Then you get your ass kicked, and it\u0027s happened a lot. You throw a punch and then they come back at you 10 at a time and you lost that one.","Before I got into fights, or before I had my first fight and was mostly running away from fights, everything seemed to happen really, really quickly. Never was clear in your memory what had happened and why you were running down the street or the panic. But after the first fight, I realized that if you actually get in a fight, everything slows down. I suppose it\u0027s adrenaline. You have time to think about everything. It\u0027s like being in a car crash. You notice things-- what people are looking at, what the person you\u0027re about to fight with is looking at, what he\u0027s paying attention to, where his hands are, if he\u0027s the kind of guy who\u0027s going to hit you first, all that stuff. You have this heightened awareness. It doesn\u0027t hurt then, but it\u0027s scary. But nothing hurts really.","I mean, I\u0027m sure that there is, but it\u0027s not unbearable pain. You don\u0027t give up because of the pain. And I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been beaten bad enough so that you would-- I\u0027ve never been beaten with a bat so that things break and start working. But being punched doesn\u0027t really hurt. It\u0027s just exhausting. That\u0027s why fights don\u0027t last very long. It\u0027s too exhausting.","Both.","It takes a lot of energy to punch somebody, and it hurts a lot when you do it. I know that you\u0027re never more tired than after you\u0027ve gotten a good beating or you\u0027ve given one. And it doesn\u0027t seem to be any more tiring getting beaten than beating up somebody.","We were at some college bar and somebody came running over all dramatic and flushed and said Evan was in the hospital and had his teeth knocked out by the rugby team. So we all got in this car and drove to the hospital-- I think it was St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie-- and stormed the emergency room through the double doors, screaming Evan\u0027s name, looking for Evan, feeling very excitable. And Evan appeared from behind the screen. I\u0027ll never forget his face. His front two teeth were just gone, and his lips were all swollen He had these big eye like, big, puppy dog eyes. And he\u0027s speaking with a lisp, talking to us. And very dramatically somebody-- it was probably me-- said, what do you want to do? Do you want to go get them, or do you want to call college court in the morning and press charges? Because we can\u0027t do both.","Oh, God. It\u0027s hideous, yeah. And so Evan of course said, with his big lips said, let\u0027s get them.","About eight of us went to a bar off campus where we knew the rugby team would be. And we called them out to have a fight.","We opened the door and started screaming at them to come out and fight. We\u0027d been drinking for the most part of the evening, so I don\u0027t remember exactly what it was that was said. Anyway, 11 guys piled out of the bar with about five rugby girls, the women who hung around with the rugby team. And Evan started insulting the women, which just incited everybody. Including actually, the rugby coach was there as well. A guy named Dennis. And at some point Dennis got upset because Evan was insulting his girlfriend and rushed Evan. And Evan ran away. And poor Evan had had his teeth knocked out already. But that wasn\u0027t good for morale for the troops. Because everybody but me and the two other guys named John left.","And the fight had already progressed to a point where we were in a circle of guys and it was about to happen. So there was no real going back. And I\u0027ll never forget watching John-- the bigger of the two Johns-- grab a guy named Andy by the balls and by the throat and lift him up over his shoulders and over a bush, where he just disappeared. There were no more Andy. And then he clapped his hands, cleaned his hands, and walked away across the street to find somebody else to punch.","Now I remember seeing that while I was getting the back of my head and the front of my head pounded at the same time by two other guys. Every time I turned around to face somebody to fight them, the guy behind me would punch me in the back of the head. And I remember thinking, this is how people die in fights. This is what happens. You get hit so hard that your neck breaks.","And then I heard this inhuman scream. And I looked on the floor, and there was the other John, the smaller of the two Johns. And the rugby coach had three fingers of John\u0027s hand is his mouth. And there was blood rimming from his mouth. He was chewing on John\u0027s fingers. And John couldn\u0027t move, and his hands were being chewed on. I was so freaked out by that. I walked over and I kicked the coach in his head as hard as I could. And his jaw sprung open, and he sort of looked around. And he got up. And so it was me and the coach facing each other. And he just started walking towards me. And I started walking backwards. And he just kept coming. And I thought, well, I can walk all the way home. He\u0027s just going to follow me, so I better just stop. And then I stopped and as he came towards me, I set my foot and took that step forward and I punched him as hard as I could in the face. Harder than I\u0027ve ever punched anybody in my life. And he fell over.","And first of all, it hurt like hell. My hand hurt. And I thought, wow, I knocked out the coach. But he popped up, like one of those Bozo the Clown punching dolls. He was on the ground for a second before he was standing up again.","Time slows down. And he just kept coming. And so I turned around to run away. And I turned around and ran into a visiting alumni whose name was Bear. And he was so much bigger than me. He just got me in a bear hug, which I guess what he\u0027s named for. And he turned me on my head, and he dropped me on my face on the concrete, right on the curb. And then the coach stood on my head and started stomping my head into the road. And it\u0027s one of those suburban roads that are paved with gravel. And so I got all the skin torn off the high point on my face, above my eye and on my chin and on my jaw. And then mercifully, we all heard police sirens.","I remember seeing Dennis the next morning after breakfast. My face was still all raw, and he had this big, black eye. I looked at his face and he looked at my face and we sort of apologized to each other in that way without saying I\u0027m sorry. And we got along fine after that. We never had any trouble. And that\u0027s true for the rest of the team. If anything, we all never spoke about it again. But we all got along much better afterwards.","Yeah, it\u0027s a win-win. We used to do that. We\u0027d just fight with each other. John broke a chair over my head once. Over my back, not really my head when I was getting up from him throwing me on the ground. And it was fine. It was part of the fun. We decided to have a fight. He poked me, I poked him. He punched me, I punched him and then we were going. And it wasn\u0027t play fighting at all.","I would really, really, really feel bad about myself if I did any of the things that I did then, now. I suppose at some point it doesn\u0027t seem appropriate anymore to be behaving that way, to be looking for a fight. I see it differently. Besides my wife.","I have the self-confidence now, I think, having been a bully, that I can do without it. I wouldn\u0027t be satisfied with that answer if I had never done it, if I had gone from running away to finding a solution to the problem. I\u0027d always be haunted by the-- why didn\u0027t you just pound the guy into the ground, see if that doesn\u0027t solve the problem. And a lot of times it does. It\u0027s really fun sometimes. Square off against a guy in a bar and you know before the fight starts that you\u0027re just going to kick his ass. And he\u0027s a schmuck, and he\u0027s starting a fight with you. And he\u0027s starting a fight with you with his arms at his sides and he\u0027s leading with his face. You just can\u0027t wait for him to say enough for you to just pop him in the face. Have it be done with and hopefully you really humiliate him. That\u0027s fun.","I don\u0027t know. Part of me would like to say yes, definitely. And part of me knows that I wouldn\u0027t do that anymore. In fact, I was thinking about this the other day. I wondered if I would turn the other cheek if something happened. I just don\u0027t think I would. I don\u0027t have the strength, the fortitude, to do that.","I don\u0027t even know where to start with it. I don\u0027t know where to start with it. I can only understand it as a metaphor. I don\u0027t know how you apply it. I\u0027ve only ever been in situations since I decided that I was going to be the guy throwing the punches, not getting them that I looked for the fight. So I\u0027m the other end of the spectrum. One day I\u0027ll probably slug Jesus. I don\u0027t think that I\u0027ve got what it takes to take a hit. I\u0027ve spent so much time defining myself as a guy who never would.","We have a neighbor who has a dog who barks all the time, and I used to get in big screaming matches with him about the dog. His behavior as a neighbor is outrageous. He\u0027s a bad neighbor. He should be punished. But I can\u0027t punish him. I\u0027m not the one who\u0027s going to do the punishing. So I made that decision. And when I think about this particular instance, I think there was a time when I would have fed the dog steel wool or broken glass or something and then created a situation where the dog was dead and I obviously did it. And then there would be a fight and I could muster all the moral righteousness for being falsely accused of killing this dog and then beating the guy up as well. That sounds like something I would-- I love the idea of it now. But I know that I\u0027m not going to poison the guy\u0027s dog. So we\u0027re just going to keep going around and around in this horrible circle where I frown at him when he says hi to me and I let him know that I disapprove of him.","It\u0027s true. Exactly right. No quick resolution."],"spokenWords":["Oh, yeah. I had to sleep out of the house. I had to go around the corner, sleep at my mom\u0027s house.

She was living day to day like anybody else. Then she heard about this boxing class that was being offered at the company gym. Some guy named Milton was teaching. Maritza liked sports. She\u0027d even taken an aerobic boxing class before, so she decided to go down and check it out.","Every day after work in Manhattan, Maritza would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train for three or four hours at Milton\u0027s gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She\u0027d grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was back so close to the streets.","When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn\u0027t tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn\u0027t approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton\u0027s, his first girl, so she\u0027d spar with the men there.","Looking at Maritza, you probably wouldn\u0027t think boxer. She\u0027s small, just over 5 feet tall and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She\u0027s radiant. It\u0027s like speaking to someone who\u0027s had a religious conversion.","With Milton\u0027s training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in \u002796 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought.","Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her \u002796 Golden Gloves win. The Garden\u0027s packed. The crowd\u0027s going wild. Martiza\u0027s incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She\u0027s calculated. The woman she\u0027s fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest.","And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza\u0027s up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head.","Ow.","In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch, straight to Maritza\u0027s face. Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming.","Can we just watch the last 10 seconds? That was so cool. Oh my God, you are so good, Maritza. I want to see you fight so badly.","We\u0027re both completely high and hysterical. Maritza\u0027s face is transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way, it\u0027s terrible because we both know she\u0027s quitting boxing.","Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing. She\u0027s only 106 pounds. They don\u0027t even have a name for her weight class. If she went pro, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her. As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she\u0027s always been put up against these same two opponents over and over. And she\u0027s beat them every time.","Maritza\u0027s lucky enough to have found the thing she loves, the thing that makes her life complete, but unlucky enough that the timing worked out all wrong. More women are getting into boxing all the time and starting younger. In 10 years, there may be enough women that Maritza would be able to make a career of it. But she\u0027s already in her 30s. She says she has to be realistic about the future. So she\u0027s gone back to school, and she\u0027s working full-time.","It\u0027s like she\u0027s in love with someone she knows she has to leave.

On the night of the fight, he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her. Maritza got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn, while Milton lied to the judges about Maritza being stuck in traffic. She arrived, beat in her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to retire that she left without even collecting her trophy. But being back in the game felt too good and after that win, she just couldn\u0027t bring herself to walk away. Despite her reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York Gloves and, of course, won.","For his part, Milton had no reservations. Maritza will always be his best girl, his first girl.

She has this theory that she\u0027ll get over boxing by going to boxing matches all the time.","In February, just after Maritza misses the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton\u0027s gym to see her fight. Even though these days Maritza isn\u0027t there much anymore, Milton has promised me that Maritza will spar with a new girl he\u0027s training. We wait and wait and no Maritza.

It turns out she\u0027s been carrying her gloves, her mouthpiece, her wraps, all of her equipment in her car for the past year just in case.","You\u0027ve got the biggest smile on your face. You look so happy right now.","She grabs her bag, and we race back to the gym. And as Maritza\u0027s getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck. Milton stands ringside, pumped up, ready to see his favorite in action again.","Maritza\u0027s stiff at first. Then she starts to relax. She\u0027s ducking down, dancing around the ring. And in the last 10 seconds of the fight, she has a surge of energy. She\u0027s punching hard, moving fast, throwing nonstop combinations.","And afterwards, she\u0027s pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with Milton and the guys in the gym. She says she\u0027ll be back to spar and train every week. And even though she\u0027s missed the deadline for this year\u0027s Golden Gloves, she swears she\u0027ll take the gloves next year.

Somebody chasing you around threatening to beat you over the head and you\u0027re just terrified about what-- you\u0027re not sure exactly what it is except that somebody said they\u0027re going to beat you over the head. So you run and you run and you run and you hope that you never get caught. And then, if you do get caught, you get a beating on the head. It\u0027s more humiliating than it is hurtful.

You throw a punch and then they come back at you 10 at a time and you lost that one.","Before I got into fights, or before I had my first fight and was mostly running away from fights, everything seemed to happen really, really quickly. Never was clear in your memory what had happened and why you were running down the street or the panic. But after the first fight, I realized that if you actually get in a fight, everything slows down. I suppose it\u0027s adrenaline. You have time to think about everything.

And he\u0027s speaking with a lisp, talking to us. And very dramatically somebody-- it was probably me-- said, what do you want to do? Do you want to go get them, or do you want to call college court in the morning and press charges? Because we can\u0027t do both.","Oh, God. It\u0027s hideous, yeah. And so Evan of course said, with his big lips said, let\u0027s get them.","About eight of us went to a bar off campus where we knew the rugby team would be. And we called them out to have a fight.","We opened the door and started screaming at them to come out and fight.

Anyway, 11 guys piled out of the bar with about five rugby girls, the women who hung around with the rugby team. And Evan started insulting the women, which just incited everybody. Including actually, the rugby coach was there as well. A guy named Dennis. And at some point Dennis got upset because Evan was insulting his girlfriend and rushed Evan. And Evan ran away. And poor Evan had had his teeth knocked out already. But that wasn\u0027t good for morale for the troops. Because everybody but me and the two other guys named John left.","And the fight had already progressed to a point where we were in a circle of guys and it was about to happen. So there was no real going back. And I\u0027ll never forget watching John-- the bigger of the two Johns-- grab a guy named Andy by the balls and by the throat and lift him up over his shoulders and over a bush, where he just disappeared. There were no more Andy. And then he clapped his hands, cleaned his hands, and walked away across the street to find somebody else to punch.","Now I remember seeing that while I was getting the back of my head and the front of my head pounded at the same time by two other guys. Every time I turned around to face somebody to fight them, the guy behind me would punch me in the back of the head. And I remember thinking, this is how people die in fights. This is what happens. You get hit so hard that your neck breaks.","And then I heard this inhuman scream. And I looked on the floor, and there was the other John, the smaller of the two Johns. And the rugby coach had three fingers of John\u0027s hand is his mouth. And there was blood rimming from his mouth. He was chewing on John\u0027s fingers. And John couldn\u0027t move, and his hands were being chewed on. I was so freaked out by that. I walked over and I kicked the coach in his head as hard as I could. And his jaw sprung open, and he sort of looked around. And he got up. And so it was me and the coach facing each other. And he just started walking towards me. And I started walking backwards. And he just kept coming. And I thought, well, I can walk all the way home. He\u0027s just going to follow me, so I better just stop. And then I stopped and as he came towards me, I set my foot and took that step forward and I punched him as hard as I could in the face. Harder than I\u0027ve ever punched anybody in my life. And he fell over.","And first of all, it hurt like hell. My hand hurt. And I thought, wow, I knocked out the coach. But he popped up, like one of those Bozo the Clown punching dolls. He was on the ground for a second before he was standing up again.","Time slows down. And he just kept coming. And so I turned around to run away. And I turned around and ran into a visiting alumni whose name was Bear. And he was so much bigger than me. He just got me in a bear hug, which I guess what he\u0027s named for. And he turned me on my head, and he dropped me on my face on the concrete, right on the curb. And then the coach stood on my head and started stomping my head into the road. And it\u0027s one of those suburban roads that are paved with gravel. And so I got all the skin torn off the high point on my face, above my eye and on my chin and on my jaw. And then mercifully, we all heard police sirens.","I remember seeing Dennis the next morning after breakfast. My face was still all raw, and he had this big, black eye. I looked at his face and he looked at my face and we sort of apologized to each other in that way without saying I\u0027m sorry. And we got along fine after that. We never had any trouble. And that\u0027s true for the rest of the team. If anything, we all never spoke about it again. But we all got along much better afterwards.","Yeah, it\u0027s a win-win. We used to do that. We\u0027d just fight with each other. John broke a chair over my head once. Over my back, not really my head when I was getting up from him throwing me on the ground. And it was fine. It was part of the fun. We decided to have a fight. He poked me, I poked him. He punched me, I punched him and then we were going. And it wasn\u0027t play fighting at all.","I would really, really, really feel bad about myself if I did any of the things that I did then, now.

He learned to fight with the other kids there. And he loved fighting, saw himself as a bully. He was such a committed fighter that when he got older he became the first person to get suspended from Vassar College for fighting. And now he\u0027s trying to stop. He\u0027s trying to stop being the one who always throws a punch. But moving from that world into the world that most of us inhabit isn\u0027t easy. He spoke with Paul Tough."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Heidi takes a cab ride home every night, which is $8.50. And we took this ride that ended up being $11.00. Clearly the meter was fast and I said to the guy, give me the receipt. I\u0027m not going to pay for the ride. And he said, oh, I knew the meter was fast. I meant to get that fixed."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"One thing led to another and I basically snapped and grabbed him and folded him up. He was outside of the cab and I was outside of the cab and I threw him inside the cab and slammed the door on his legs and he drove away."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So was it like a standoff sort of thing where the two of you were standing outside the cab sort of shoving each other?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Yeah, you pay me. You pay me. No, I won\u0027t pay you. You pay me no. No, I won\u0027t pay you. And then he said that I was an enemy of the people. Which, since he was ripping me off, seemed like a pretty outrageous claim. But I snapped, and I just charged him. That\u0027s a failing on my part. I should be able to take his number and complain to the Taxi and Limousine Commission and take him to court, do it the right way. There\u0027s always a way out of a fight."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"You were with your wife and you were with another guy. And how did the two of them react?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Sam loved it, and Heidi hated it. Heidi walked away."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Did she give you a hard time?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Oh, yeah. I had to sleep out of the house. I had to go around the corner, sleep at my mom\u0027s house. Arguably, a fair punishment."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I remember being a little kid and running away from a fight and being terrified and being blind and running and running and running and running. And it occurred to me that if people-- it\u0027s like playground fighting, but it\u0027s pretty traumatic when you\u0027re a little kid. Somebody chasing you around threatening to beat you over the head and you\u0027re just terrified about what-- you\u0027re not sure exactly what it is except that somebody said they\u0027re going to beat you over the head. So you run and you run and you run and you hope that you never get caught. And then, if you do get caught, you get a beating on the head. It\u0027s more humiliating than it is hurtful. But at some point you decide, well, I\u0027m not going to be the guy being chased in the playground. I\u0027m going to do the chasing. It\u0027s as much to avoid the humiliation of having to run away as it is really enjoying doling it out. Although you quickly learn to enjoy being a bully."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"But you\u0027re saying there was a moment where you made that decision for yourself?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Yeah, I thought if you can choose to be the guy throwing the beating, then you might as well be that guy instead of the guy getting the beating."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"The things that I learned early on were you prepare for a fight way ahead of time. If you\u0027re going to go out at night, you wear big shoes because you end up on the floor getting dragged around and sometimes you have to kick people. Always throw the first punch. Punch in the throat and the eyes, the nuts, and the knees. Don\u0027t bother with any other part of the body if you want to win the fight. Never tell anybody you\u0027re going to fight them. Just punch them."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"It\u0027s important to be the guy who can throw the punch to me. And it\u0027s more important than whether or not you win the fights or not, I think. But it\u0027s a hard thing to do, to throw a punch. Because you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen afterwards. Then you get your ass kicked, and it\u0027s happened a lot. You throw a punch and then they come back at you 10 at a time and you lost that one."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Before I got into fights, or before I had my first fight and was mostly running away from fights, everything seemed to happen really, really quickly. Never was clear in your memory what had happened and why you were running down the street or the panic. But after the first fight, I realized that if you actually get in a fight, everything slows down. I suppose it\u0027s adrenaline. You have time to think about everything. It\u0027s like being in a car crash. You notice things-- what people are looking at, what the person you\u0027re about to fight with is looking at, what he\u0027s paying attention to, where his hands are, if he\u0027s the kind of guy who\u0027s going to hit you first, all that stuff. You have this heightened awareness. It doesn\u0027t hurt then, but it\u0027s scary. But nothing hurts really."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Really? So when you\u0027re in a fight there\u0027s no pain at all?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I mean, I\u0027m sure that there is, but it\u0027s not unbearable pain. You don\u0027t give up because of the pain. And I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been beaten bad enough so that you would-- I\u0027ve never been beaten with a bat so that things break and start working. But being punched doesn\u0027t really hurt. It\u0027s just exhausting. That\u0027s why fights don\u0027t last very long. It\u0027s too exhausting."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It\u0027s exhausting to punch something, or it\u0027s exhausting to get punched by somebody?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Both."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"How is that exhausting?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"It takes a lot of energy to punch somebody, and it hurts a lot when you do it. I know that you\u0027re never more tired than after you\u0027ve gotten a good beating or you\u0027ve given one. And it doesn\u0027t seem to be any more tiring getting beaten than beating up somebody."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"We were at some college bar and somebody came running over all dramatic and flushed and said Evan was in the hospital and had his teeth knocked out by the rugby team. So we all got in this car and drove to the hospital-- I think it was St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie-- and stormed the emergency room through the double doors, screaming Evan\u0027s name, looking for Evan, feeling very excitable. And Evan appeared from behind the screen. I\u0027ll never forget his face. His front two teeth were just gone, and his lips were all swollen He had these big eye like, big, puppy dog eyes. And he\u0027s speaking with a lisp, talking to us. And very dramatically somebody-- it was probably me-- said, what do you want to do? Do you want to go get them, or do you want to call college court in the morning and press charges? Because we can\u0027t do both."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It was kind of a little bit of a movie moment?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Oh, God. It\u0027s hideous, yeah. And so Evan of course said, with his big lips said, let\u0027s get them."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"About eight of us went to a bar off campus where we knew the rugby team would be. And we called them out to have a fight."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What do you mean? How\u0027d you do that?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"We opened the door and started screaming at them to come out and fight. We\u0027d been drinking for the most part of the evening, so I don\u0027t remember exactly what it was that was said. Anyway, 11 guys piled out of the bar with about five rugby girls, the women who hung around with the rugby team. And Evan started insulting the women, which just incited everybody. Including actually, the rugby coach was there as well. A guy named Dennis. And at some point Dennis got upset because Evan was insulting his girlfriend and rushed Evan. And Evan ran away. And poor Evan had had his teeth knocked out already. But that wasn\u0027t good for morale for the troops. Because everybody but me and the two other guys named John left."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"And the fight had already progressed to a point where we were in a circle of guys and it was about to happen. So there was no real going back. And I\u0027ll never forget watching John-- the bigger of the two Johns-- grab a guy named Andy by the balls and by the throat and lift him up over his shoulders and over a bush, where he just disappeared. There were no more Andy. And then he clapped his hands, cleaned his hands, and walked away across the street to find somebody else to punch."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Now I remember seeing that while I was getting the back of my head and the front of my head pounded at the same time by two other guys. Every time I turned around to face somebody to fight them, the guy behind me would punch me in the back of the head. And I remember thinking, this is how people die in fights. This is what happens. You get hit so hard that your neck breaks."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"And then I heard this inhuman scream. And I looked on the floor, and there was the other John, the smaller of the two Johns. And the rugby coach had three fingers of John\u0027s hand is his mouth. And there was blood rimming from his mouth. He was chewing on John\u0027s fingers. And John couldn\u0027t move, and his hands were being chewed on. I was so freaked out by that. I walked over and I kicked the coach in his head as hard as I could. And his jaw sprung open, and he sort of looked around. And he got up. And so it was me and the coach facing each other. And he just started walking towards me. And I started walking backwards. And he just kept coming. And I thought, well, I can walk all the way home. He\u0027s just going to follow me, so I better just stop. And then I stopped and as he came towards me, I set my foot and took that step forward and I punched him as hard as I could in the face. Harder than I\u0027ve ever punched anybody in my life. And he fell over."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"And first of all, it hurt like hell. My hand hurt. And I thought, wow, I knocked out the coach. But he popped up, like one of those Bozo the Clown punching dolls. He was on the ground for a second before he was standing up again."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"A second where everything was working out."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Time slows down. And he just kept coming. And so I turned around to run away. And I turned around and ran into a visiting alumni whose name was Bear. And he was so much bigger than me. He just got me in a bear hug, which I guess what he\u0027s named for. And he turned me on my head, and he dropped me on my face on the concrete, right on the curb. And then the coach stood on my head and started stomping my head into the road. And it\u0027s one of those suburban roads that are paved with gravel. And so I got all the skin torn off the high point on my face, above my eye and on my chin and on my jaw. And then mercifully, we all heard police sirens."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I remember seeing Dennis the next morning after breakfast. My face was still all raw, and he had this big, black eye. I looked at his face and he looked at my face and we sort of apologized to each other in that way without saying I\u0027m sorry. And we got along fine after that. We never had any trouble. And that\u0027s true for the rest of the team. If anything, we all never spoke about it again. But we all got along much better afterwards."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you feel like there\u0027s some fights in which it\u0027s just like-- I mean if you\u0027re at a bar and you\u0027re with some people who want to fight and there\u0027s other people who want to fight, I mean that\u0027s just-- everybody wins?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Yeah, it\u0027s a win-win. We used to do that. We\u0027d just fight with each other. John broke a chair over my head once. Over my back, not really my head when I was getting up from him throwing me on the ground. And it was fine. It was part of the fun. We decided to have a fight. He poked me, I poked him. He punched me, I punched him and then we were going. And it wasn\u0027t play fighting at all."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I would really, really, really feel bad about myself if I did any of the things that I did then, now. I suppose at some point it doesn\u0027t seem appropriate anymore to be behaving that way, to be looking for a fight. I see it differently. Besides my wife."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So do you feel like-- I mean, you talked about this one moment on the schoolyard where you decided you were going to be the guy who punched instead of the guy who got punched. Do you feel like now you\u0027re trying to make the opposite decision, you\u0027re trying to become the guy who runs away again?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I have the self-confidence now, I think, having been a bully, that I can do without it. I wouldn\u0027t be satisfied with that answer if I had never done it, if I had gone from running away to finding a solution to the problem. I\u0027d always be haunted by the-- why didn\u0027t you just pound the guy into the ground, see if that doesn\u0027t solve the problem. And a lot of times it does. It\u0027s really fun sometimes. Square off against a guy in a bar and you know before the fight starts that you\u0027re just going to kick his ass. And he\u0027s a schmuck, and he\u0027s starting a fight with you. And he\u0027s starting a fight with you with his arms at his sides and he\u0027s leading with his face. You just can\u0027t wait for him to say enough for you to just pop him in the face. Have it be done with and hopefully you really humiliate him. That\u0027s fun."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So even now you would still feel that way in a bar if there was a guy just being clearly the idiot? You\u0027d take the first swing and you\u0027d feel good about it?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I don\u0027t know. Part of me would like to say yes, definitely. And part of me knows that I wouldn\u0027t do that anymore. In fact, I was thinking about this the other day. I wondered if I would turn the other cheek if something happened. I just don\u0027t think I would. I don\u0027t have the strength, the fortitude, to do that."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What do you think of that line in the Bible of turning the other cheek?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I don\u0027t even know where to start with it. I don\u0027t know where to start with it. I can only understand it as a metaphor. I don\u0027t know how you apply it. I\u0027ve only ever been in situations since I decided that I was going to be the guy throwing the punches, not getting them that I looked for the fight. So I\u0027m the other end of the spectrum. One day I\u0027ll probably slug Jesus. I don\u0027t think that I\u0027ve got what it takes to take a hit. I\u0027ve spent so much time defining myself as a guy who never would."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"We have a neighbor who has a dog who barks all the time, and I used to get in big screaming matches with him about the dog. His behavior as a neighbor is outrageous. He\u0027s a bad neighbor. He should be punished. But I can\u0027t punish him. I\u0027m not the one who\u0027s going to do the punishing. So I made that decision. And when I think about this particular instance, I think there was a time when I would have fed the dog steel wool or broken glass or something and then created a situation where the dog was dead and I obviously did it. And then there would be a fight and I could muster all the moral righteousness for being falsely accused of killing this dog and then beating the guy up as well. That sounds like something I would-- I love the idea of it now. But I know that I\u0027m not going to poison the guy\u0027s dog. So we\u0027re just going to keep going around and around in this horrible circle where I frown at him when he says hi to me and I let him know that I disapprove of him."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"That\u0027s the problem with the world where you don\u0027t throw punches, things just go on and on."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"It\u0027s true. Exactly right. No quick resolution."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Manny Howard still lives in Brooklyn where he writes a column about bars for the New York Press and does other writing. He talked to This American Life senior editor Paul Tough."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When is fighting cathartic? In Kodiak, Alaska, on the Fourth of July, in front of the American legion Hall, they used to set up a boxing ring and all day long, with hundreds of people watching, the citizens of Kodiak would fight. Third grade kids, fifth grade kids, and adults, lots of adults. They called it rough house boxing. Radio producers Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson, The Kitchen Sisters, witnessed it a few years back."},{"speakerName":"Davia Nelson","text":"A lot of these were sort of grudge matches that had built up on fishing boats all season, and people can\u0027t very well on a fishing boat, duke it out, and have a successful run.

Little kids."},{"speakerName":"Davia Nelson","text":"In listening to the tape, we\u0027re hearing the emcee of the boxing event urge different couples that he knows are having marital trouble to get in the ring. Come on, Roxanne. Come on, Jack. get in the ring."},{"speakerName":"Emcee","text":"Jones, you and Roxanne get in there. Art, how about you over there?"},{"speakerName":"Davia Nelson","text":"It was kind of an all-purpose kind of a cleansing. A kind of a village cleansing. And I have always called the event Yom Kippur with Gloves. Because to me, I was raised with what Yom Kippur was."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Let me just say that Yom Kippur is the Jewish holiday of atonement."},{"speakerName":"Davia Nelson","text":"Which you had to atone for your sins and you had to at least forgive. You might not forget, but you got to get over it. You got to move on. You got to work it out. You\u0027ve got one day to do it. It was great too because it was sort of like the block party gone wild.

If this were on TV, don\u0027t you think this would be just like a huge thing? Where like two people who have a grudge come before whoever the host of the show is going to be. Let\u0027s say George Foreman. And he\u0027s the referee of the match. He\u0027s the Judge Wapner of this thing. And then the two people would come before him, and they both would sign some sort of liability form before they go on. And just like The People\u0027s Court, then they would explain what their little tiff was about.

She was living day to day like anybody else. Then she heard about this boxing class that was being offered at the company gym. Some guy named Milton was teaching. Maritza liked sports. She\u0027d even taken an aerobic boxing class before, so she decided to go down and check it out.","Every day after work in Manhattan, Maritza would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train for three or four hours at Milton\u0027s gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She\u0027d grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was back so close to the streets.","When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn\u0027t tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn\u0027t approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton\u0027s, his first girl, so she\u0027d spar with the men there.","Looking at Maritza, you probably wouldn\u0027t think boxer. She\u0027s small, just over 5 feet tall and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She\u0027s radiant. It\u0027s like speaking to someone who\u0027s had a religious conversion.","With Milton\u0027s training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in \u002796 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought.","Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her \u002796 Golden Gloves win. The Garden\u0027s packed. The crowd\u0027s going wild. Martiza\u0027s incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She\u0027s calculated. The woman she\u0027s fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest.","And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza\u0027s up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head.","Ow.","In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch, straight to Maritza\u0027s face. Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming.","Can we just watch the last 10 seconds? That was so cool. Oh my God, you are so good, Maritza. I want to see you fight so badly.","We\u0027re both completely high and hysterical. Maritza\u0027s face is transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way, it\u0027s terrible because we both know she\u0027s quitting boxing.","Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing. She\u0027s only 106 pounds. They don\u0027t even have a name for her weight class. If she went pro, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her. As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she\u0027s always been put up against these same two opponents over and over. And she\u0027s beat them every time.","Maritza\u0027s lucky enough to have found the thing she loves, the thing that makes her life complete, but unlucky enough that the timing worked out all wrong. More women are getting into boxing all the time and starting younger. In 10 years, there may be enough women that Maritza would be able to make a career of it. But she\u0027s already in her 30s. She says she has to be realistic about the future. So she\u0027s gone back to school, and she\u0027s working full-time.","It\u0027s like she\u0027s in love with someone she knows she has to leave. So she circles around boxing, quits, comes back for one night stands.","Last year, Milton signed her up for the Metros tournament without telling her. On the night of the fight, he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her. Maritza got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn, while Milton lied to the judges about Maritza being stuck in traffic. She arrived, beat in her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to retire that she left without even collecting her trophy. But being back in the game felt too good and after that win, she just couldn\u0027t bring herself to walk away. Despite her reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York Gloves and, of course, won.","For his part, Milton had no reservations. Maritza will always be his best girl, his first girl. But he\u0027s now becoming resigned to the fact that she doesn\u0027t have much time left in boxing.","Here\u0027s how hard this is for Maritza. Even her plans for retirement from boxing include boxing. She\u0027s training to be a massage therapist. To massage boxers, she says. She quit her job as an accountant and now works full-time as a trainer in a gym. She has this theory that she\u0027ll get over boxing by going to boxing matches all the time.","In February, just after Maritza misses the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton\u0027s gym to see her fight. Even though these days Maritza isn\u0027t there much anymore, Milton has promised me that Maritza will spar with a new girl he\u0027s training. We wait and wait and no Maritza. An hour passes.","When she finally shows, she looks worn out and tired. She\u0027s not dressed to box, and she says she\u0027s got the flu. She\u0027s not going to fight. Right away everyone starts pushing her.","She says she didn\u0027t bring her shoes. She doesn\u0027t have any of her gear. Milton points to some shoes lying in the corner, says they\u0027re her size. Suddenly Maritza doesn\u0027t look so tired.","Then Maritza drops the pretense. We head down in the elevator to her car. It turns out she\u0027s been carrying her gloves, her mouthpiece, her wraps, all of her equipment in her car for the past year just in case.","You\u0027ve got the biggest smile on your face. You look so happy right now.","She grabs her bag, and we race back to the gym. And as Maritza\u0027s getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck. Milton stands ringside, pumped up, ready to see his favorite in action again.","Maritza\u0027s stiff at first. Then she starts to relax. She\u0027s ducking down, dancing around the ring. And in the last 10 seconds of the fight, she has a surge of energy. She\u0027s punching hard, moving fast, throwing nonstop combinations.","And afterwards, she\u0027s pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with Milton and the guys in the gym. She says she\u0027ll be back to spar and train every week. And even though she\u0027s missed the deadline for this year\u0027s Golden Gloves, she swears she\u0027ll take the gloves next year. Stay tuned for 1999, she says. Stay tuned.","But Maritza doesn\u0027t show at Milton\u0027s the next week or the week after. She breaks two appointments with me. She doesn\u0027t return my calls. And when I finally reach her, she\u0027s angry. Angry she fought again. Scared she\u0027s getting sucked back in.","And how about the fact that you\u0027re still carrying around your gear?"],"spokenWords":["When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn\u0027t tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn\u0027t approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton\u0027s, his first girl, so she\u0027d spar with the men there.","Here\u0027s how hard this is for Maritza.

She quit her job as an accountant and now works full-time as a trainer in a gym. She has this theory that she\u0027ll get over boxing by going to boxing matches all the time.","With Milton\u0027s training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in \u002796 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought.","Maritza\u0027s lucky enough to have found the thing she loves, the thing that makes her life complete, but unlucky enough that the timing worked out all wrong.

Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming.","And how about the fact that you\u0027re still carrying around your gear?","Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing.

She\u0027s small, just over 5 feet tall and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She\u0027s radiant. It\u0027s like speaking to someone who\u0027s had a religious conversion.","And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza\u0027s up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head.","Every day after work in Manhattan, Maritza would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train for three or four hours at Milton\u0027s gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She\u0027d grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was back so close to the streets.","Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her \u002796 Golden Gloves win. The Garden\u0027s packed. The crowd\u0027s going wild. Martiza\u0027s incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She\u0027s calculated. The woman she\u0027s fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest.","But Maritza doesn\u0027t show at Milton\u0027s the next week or the week after.

I go, honey, what I got you doing right now, no girl fights the way you do right now."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"That\u0027s how it all started."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Every day after work in Manhattan, Maritza would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train for three or four hours at Milton\u0027s gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She\u0027d grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was back so close to the streets."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn\u0027t tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn\u0027t approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton\u0027s, his first girl, so she\u0027d spar with the men there."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"She took Joey one day and she was throwing nonstop combinations and punches repetitiously. There was an old man sitting down in the chair and he goes, god damn that boy can throw some punches. She had the head gear on. So when she finished he came over to me. He goes, that\u0027s going to be one good damn fighter. That boy is going to be great. He goes, who is that? I go, what guy you talking about? He goes, that guy. I go, I hate to tell you this, that\u0027s no guy. He goes, what do you mean, that\u0027s no guy? Looked like a guy. I go, that\u0027s a girl. That ain\u0027t no damn girl. I go, that\u0027s a girl. He goes, get out of here. So I said, Maritza come here. So she come over to me and I took off her head gear. I go, does she look like a girl now? He goes, oh."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Looking at Maritza, you probably wouldn\u0027t think boxer. She\u0027s small, just over 5 feet tall and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She\u0027s radiant. It\u0027s like speaking to someone who\u0027s had a religious conversion."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Boxing has shed a light on me. It\u0027s like my vision.

She\u0027s been boxing for a year and is a Metros champ. This is her first--"},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"With Milton\u0027s training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in \u002796 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought."},{"speakerName":"Commentator","text":"Two straight left hands by Arroyo. And another straight left. Four straight left hands by Arroyo."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her \u002796 Golden Gloves win. The Garden\u0027s packed. The crowd\u0027s going wild. Martiza\u0027s incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She\u0027s calculated. The woman she\u0027s fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza\u0027s up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"There goes the upper cuts. There goes another one to the body."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Ow."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Another one to the body. Another one. Another one."},{"speakerName":"Commentator","text":"And another. Followed by a big right hook. Manson in trouble."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch, straight to Maritza\u0027s face. Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"There, there goes the hook. See that? That\u0027s it. 10 seconds. Bam. There you go. I threw it all. Go, go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. Throw it. I missed a lot, but I threw."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Can we just watch the last 10 seconds? That was so cool. Oh my God, you are so good, Maritza. I want to see you fight so badly."},{"text":"After the fight ends, we\u0027re laughing. We keep rewinding to watch Maritza\u0027s amazing finale."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"I\u0027m like, really? You got it good, right? Well, OK. All right. All right. All right. All right. OK, OK. That was a grin. That was a good grin."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"We\u0027re both completely high and hysterical. Maritza\u0027s face is transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way, it\u0027s terrible because we both know she\u0027s quitting boxing."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing. She\u0027s only 106 pounds. They don\u0027t even have a name for her weight class. If she went pro, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her. As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she\u0027s always been put up against these same two opponents over and over. And she\u0027s beat them every time."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza\u0027s lucky enough to have found the thing she loves, the thing that makes her life complete, but unlucky enough that the timing worked out all wrong. More women are getting into boxing all the time and starting younger. In 10 years, there may be enough women that Maritza would be able to make a career of it. But she\u0027s already in her 30s. She says she has to be realistic about the future. So she\u0027s gone back to school, and she\u0027s working full-time."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"I get mixed feelings. When I go into the gym, I want to do it. But when I come away from the gym and I start looking at reality, it\u0027s like, I\u0027m sad. It\u0027s a sadness."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"On the outside, no one sees it. But on the inside it\u0027s like it died. It\u0027s like, God, it could have been you. You should be in there boxing."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"It\u0027s like she\u0027s in love with someone she knows she has to leave. So she circles around boxing, quits, comes back for one night stands."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Last year, Milton signed her up for the Metros tournament without telling her. On the night of the fight, he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her. Maritza got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn, while Milton lied to the judges about Maritza being stuck in traffic. She arrived, beat in her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to retire that she left without even collecting her trophy. But being back in the game felt too good and after that win, she just couldn\u0027t bring herself to walk away. Despite her reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York Gloves and, of course, won."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"For his part, Milton had no reservations. Maritza will always be his best girl, his first girl. But he\u0027s now becoming resigned to the fact that she doesn\u0027t have much time left in boxing."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"She boxes like street people were to call [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in his prime. She\u0027s slick. She\u0027s smart. She thinks in there. She doesn\u0027t really get hit. She don\u0027t let you give her a beating. She hands out the beatings."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"You know, I wish I would\u0027ve found her when she was a little bit younger. A lot younger."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Here\u0027s how hard this is for Maritza. Even her plans for retirement from boxing include boxing. She\u0027s training to be a massage therapist. To massage boxers, she says. She quit her job as an accountant and now works full-time as a trainer in a gym. She has this theory that she\u0027ll get over boxing by going to boxing matches all the time."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Maybe I\u0027ll overcome it by being there. Maybe that\u0027s what I need to do, is to face it. To face the fact that finally I\u0027m not doing it anymore, that I\u0027m not going to be boxing anymore. Maybe that\u0027s what I need."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"Go. There it is. That\u0027s good. Come out here real quick. There you go. See the difference? Go."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"In February, just after Maritza misses the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton\u0027s gym to see her fight. Even though these days Maritza isn\u0027t there much anymore, Milton has promised me that Maritza will spar with a new girl he\u0027s training. We wait and wait and no Maritza. An hour passes."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"When she finally shows, she looks worn out and tired. She\u0027s not dressed to box, and she says she\u0027s got the flu. She\u0027s not going to fight. Right away everyone starts pushing her."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Well, let\u0027s just do a little."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"You want to? But I got nothing with me."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"What do you need?"},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Everything. I don\u0027t have nothing."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"She says she didn\u0027t bring her shoes. She doesn\u0027t have any of her gear. Milton points to some shoes lying in the corner, says they\u0027re her size. Suddenly Maritza doesn\u0027t look so tired."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"But I got to tell you, I have no mouthpiece."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Then Maritza drops the pretense. We head down in the elevator to her car. It turns out she\u0027s been carrying her gloves, her mouthpiece, her wraps, all of her equipment in her car for the past year just in case."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"I knew this was going to happen. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t want to come around. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t want to come."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"You\u0027ve got the biggest smile on your face. You look so happy right now."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Because I love boxing. That\u0027s why. It\u0027s what\u0027s got me where I\u0027m at today. Very happy and very balanced I guess. We\u0027re around Second Avenue. Second Avenue. Between Second and Third and 13th Street. So here I am with no voice, going in this room to go spar. Is that crazy? That\u0027s crazy."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"She grabs her bag, and we race back to the gym. And as Maritza\u0027s getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck. Milton stands ringside, pumped up, ready to see his favorite in action again."},{"speakerName":"Howard Kelso","text":"This is Howard Kelso live right here from Supreme Team Boxing."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Box."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"Relax your shoulders, Maritza. Relax your shoulders. Too tight. Oh, good one."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza\u0027s stiff at first. Then she starts to relax. She\u0027s ducking down, dancing around the ring. And in the last 10 seconds of the fight, she has a surge of energy. She\u0027s punching hard, moving fast, throwing nonstop combinations."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"Come on, girls. Time."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"And afterwards, she\u0027s pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with Milton and the guys in the gym. She says she\u0027ll be back to spar and train every week. And even though she\u0027s missed the deadline for this year\u0027s Golden Gloves, she swears she\u0027ll take the gloves next year. Stay tuned for 1999, she says. Stay tuned."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"But Maritza doesn\u0027t show at Milton\u0027s the next week or the week after. She breaks two appointments with me. She doesn\u0027t return my calls. And when I finally reach her, she\u0027s angry. Angry she fought again.

Maybe it\u0027s my security blanket. It\u0027s like always knowing that it\u0027s always there, that I can always hit that bag. I get in front of the mirror at my house every day. Just jab and come around and do the moves. It\u0027s my connection to boxing. I carry this with me. I sleep with it. I have gloves in my car. I love it.

A year ago in a nightclub in Miami, the 170-pound Frankie knocked out a guy weighing 260 with a right hand. He says the punch brought everyone to their feet, including a middle-aged dance club owner from Chicago named Ruben Pazmino.","That night, Ruben had a vision for his Tropicana Club, and it revolved around Frankie Cruz. Later that week, Frankie was on a plane to Chicago.","It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning at the Tropicana, a Latino nightclub that houses four bars, a VIP room, a restaurant, and a huge dance floor with a balcony. It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning and nearly a thousand people are packed inside on a Tuesday. After the weightlifting contest and after the lip syncing and after the four erotic dancers finish massaging a shirtless man with baby oil, there\u0027s boxing in a regulation ring set up in the middle of the dance floor. It\u0027s fight night, and the star is walking in the door. It\u0027s Frankie.","Hip and beautiful Latinas turn to look at the 5 foot 10 Nicaraguan born fighter with dyed blond hair and a broken nose. He\u0027s not yet dressed in his boxing gear. Instead he wears a mustard-colored sports coat, slacks, and so much jewelry that he literally makes noise when he moves.","Here\u0027s Frankie\u0027s job. Here\u0027s the job he left his kids and family for. It\u0027s free-for-all boxing. Anyone can fight. You can fight. I could fight. Anyone. All you have to do is sign a release form agreeing that if your nose breaks, teeth get punched out, or you end up with a mild concussion, you know it\u0027s your fault for being too drunk and easily encouraged by your friends to get into a boxing ring in the first place.","You can choose to fight your best friend, your nemesis, or you can take your chances and fight Frankie. If you knock down Frankie, you get $1,000 in cash or the mysterious grand prize. Everyone goes for the cash.","Frankie will fight anyone who signs up. Sometimes he\u0027s boxed five or six matches in one night, an incredible feat of endurance, something no pro boxer will ever do. And Frankie gets paid the same whether he fights one guy or five guys.","He\u0027s fought with one arm tied behind his back. He\u0027s fought three guys at once. He\u0027s fought, in all, 128 fights at the Tropicana. He\u0027s won 127.","Frankie won\u0027t say how much he gets paid, but it\u0027s not much. And he says he sends most of that money back to his ex-wife, his three children, and his grandmother in Miami. So he\u0027s broke all the time.","For the first seven months he was in Chicago, Frankie lived in a back room of the Tropicana. He also worked as a bouncer on the nights he wasn\u0027t boxing. So for days on end, Frankie never left the club. Sometimes on a Saturday or Sunday when the business offices were closed, Frankie would be locked inside and would have to wait for the Tropicana to open in order to leave.","He says he didn\u0027t mind it that much until Ruben, the owner, took his television set away in order to start up a new karaoke night.","Right now two African American guys from the audience have signed up to fight each other and are going at it in the ring. Both weigh well over 200 pounds. While they clumsily stumble around the ring, taking wide punches and falling against the ropes, the almost preteen-looking ring girls get instructions on what they\u0027re supposed to do when Frankie re-enters the ring.","The girls in thong bikinis hustle around as Frankie emerges, now wearing a blue and gold running suit, a straw cowboy hat, and a Nicaraguan scarf tied around his neck.","Frankie stands with the announcer while the two ring girls walk in circles, each holding an end of his championship belt. The belt always gets the center spotlight.","When training, Frankie lays the belt down next to his treadmill, says a prayer, and starts running. It\u0027s on the floor next to him when he\u0027s jumping rope.","Once when I showed up to interview him at his gym, before we could go off to talk, he opened his gym bag and pulled out a little plastic stand that you use for picture frames. He put the stand on a desk facing the front door of the gym and put the belt on it.","On one end of the belt is Frankie\u0027s name. On the other, Viva Auto Sales Park because unfortunately, the Tropicana didn\u0027t give him the belt. For several months Frankie says, he continually asked Ruben for one but kept getting blown off.","Instead, a friend introduced Frankie to the owner of Viva Auto Sales. The guy agreed to buy the belt for Frankie if he could put the Viva name on it. It\u0027s a good investment. You meet Frankie, you meet the belt.","Leaving the belt with the ring girls, Frankie climbs between the ropes and gets in his corner. His managers, Danny and Hank, are there with him. They\u0027re grooming him to go pro in June. They give him a place to live. They see that he eats right, doesn\u0027t drink, and trains every day.","Frankie\u0027s opponent doesn\u0027t look too intimidating. Staggering, he enters the ring wearing jeans, a long sleeve green shirt, and Doc Martens. He\u0027s at least 240 pounds, complete with overhanging gut and love handles. It would take a lot of alcohol to make someone like this believe he belongs in a ring with a trained Olympic medalist. But he\u0027s had a lot of alcohol.","Hank and Danny size up the guy. The fact that he\u0027s drunk means his fighting may be sloppy. But it also makes it harder on Frankie because the drunks don\u0027t feel the pain as much. As the bell goes off, Hank screams instructions from the corner.","Frankie\u0027s splayed against the ropes. In a shocking move, Frankie\u0027s opponent came racing out of the corner and immediately began swinging. It\u0027s a barfighter\u0027s tactic, get in the first punch. He gets Frankie up against the ropes in the corner and on the defense, as Frankie only manages to get in a few body jabs.","It never occurred to me how hard Frankie would have to work to win his fights, how much of a beating he takes. He looks tired and confused.","At the end of the first round, Hank and Danny counsel Frankie in the corner. Mostly it\u0027s a big pep talk. You\u0027re the champ, they yell. You\u0027re the champ.","In round two, Frankie comes back. His opponent\u0027s punches becomes weaker. At times they miss Frankie completely. And almost gently, Frankie edges the guy up against the ropes in his own corner and does combinations to his head, pounds away at him. Blood spurts everywhere.","It\u0027s an incredible moment, satisfying in a way I never would have guessed. Sweat and spit fly off Frankie\u0027s body. Hank and Danny go wild. The crowd goes wild. Frankie breaks the guy\u0027s nose and the ref ends the fight.","When Frankie staggers back and drops his hands, blood drips from his gloves onto the starched, white mat. Hank screams at him.","Boxing can make you feel so small. The force of the punches is so brutal and penetrating that it\u0027s almost mythical. When Frankie climbed out of the ring, he asked me if I was impressed. I couldn\u0027t even answer. I couldn\u0027t talk to him.","In only a few minutes, this guy who has to beg for a belt from a used car dealership suddenly seemed untouchable.","I\u0027ve asked Frankie over and over what he loves about boxing, and he doesn\u0027t really say anything. He doesn\u0027t like hurting people. He doesn\u0027t have any romantic ideas about the tradition of boxing or its primal appeal. That\u0027s not why he boxes. It\u0027s a job. A job that doesn\u0027t pay all that much in grimy, punishing, working conditions. A job that he\u0027s good at, but that doesn\u0027t hold a lot of mystery anymore. The one thing that makes it special for Frankie is the crowds.","After his match, Frankie begins jumping around, running through the crowds up to the top floor of the nightclub, looking for fans. He does this every time, Hank says. When Frankie sees me, he stops and motions for me to follow, so I can record how much the crowd loves him.","Out of the ring looking for attention, Frankie doesn\u0027t seem like a giant anymore. He\u0027s a guy, boyish even.","A lot of people come over and shake his hand, say a word. A lot more push right by him, heading down to the ring where six women from the audience are now taking part in a do-it-yourself strip tease. Men in the audience pull dollar bills from their wallets and shove past. They don\u0027t look at Frankie.","[MEN CHANT \"TAKE IT OFF\"]"],"spokenWords":["Here\u0027s Frankie\u0027s job.

The one thing that makes it special for Frankie is the crowds.","He\u0027s fought with one arm tied behind his back. He\u0027s fought three guys at once. He\u0027s fought, in all, 128 fights at the Tropicana. He\u0027s won 127.","Frankie stands with the announcer while the two ring girls walk in circles, each holding an end of his championship belt. The belt always gets the center spotlight.","You can choose to fight your best friend, your nemesis, or you can take your chances and fight Frankie. If you knock down Frankie, you get $1,000 in cash or the mysterious grand prize. Everyone goes for the cash.","A lot of people come over and shake his hand, say a word. A lot more push right by him, heading down to the ring where six women from the audience are now taking part in a do-it-yourself strip tease. Men in the audience pull dollar bills from their wallets and shove past. They don\u0027t look at Frankie.","Frankie won\u0027t say how much he gets paid, but it\u0027s not much. And he says he sends most of that money back to his ex-wife, his three children, and his grandmother in Miami.

It\u0027s a good investment. You meet Frankie, you meet the belt.","He says he didn\u0027t mind it that much until Ruben, the owner, took his television set away in order to start up a new karaoke night.","On one end of the belt is Frankie\u0027s name. On the other, Viva Auto Sales Park because unfortunately, the Tropicana didn\u0027t give him the belt. For several months Frankie says, he continually asked Ruben for one but kept getting blown off.","Hank and Danny size up the guy. The fact that he\u0027s drunk means his fighting may be sloppy. But it also makes it harder on Frankie because the drunks don\u0027t feel the pain as much. As the bell goes off, Hank screams instructions from the corner.","In round two, Frankie comes back. His opponent\u0027s punches becomes weaker. At times they miss Frankie completely. And almost gently, Frankie edges the guy up against the ropes in his own corner and does combinations to his head, pounds away at him. Blood spurts everywhere.","[MEN CHANT \"TAKE IT OFF\"]","At the end of the first round, Hank and Danny counsel Frankie in the corner. Mostly it\u0027s a big pep talk. You\u0027re the champ, they yell. You\u0027re the champ.","Out of the ring looking for attention, Frankie doesn\u0027t seem like a giant anymore. He\u0027s a guy, boyish even.","It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning at the Tropicana, a Latino nightclub that houses four bars, a VIP room, a restaurant, and a huge dance floor with a balcony.

After the weightlifting contest and after the lip syncing and after the four erotic dancers finish massaging a shirtless man with baby oil, there\u0027s boxing in a regulation ring set up in the middle of the dance floor. It\u0027s fight night, and the star is walking in the door. It\u0027s Frankie.","For the first seven months he was in Chicago, Frankie lived in a back room of the Tropicana. He also worked as a bouncer on the nights he wasn\u0027t boxing. So for days on end, Frankie never left the club. Sometimes on a Saturday or Sunday when the business offices were closed, Frankie would be locked inside and would have to wait for the Tropicana to open in order to leave.","That night, Ruben had a vision for his Tropicana Club, and it revolved around Frankie Cruz. Later that week, Frankie was on a plane to Chicago.","Right now two African American guys from the audience have signed up to fight each other and are going at it in the ring. Both weigh well over 200 pounds. While they clumsily stumble around the ring, taking wide punches and falling against the ropes, the almost preteen-looking ring girls get instructions on what they\u0027re supposed to do when Frankie re-enters the ring.","When training, Frankie lays the belt down next to his treadmill, says a prayer, and starts running.

A room he says that all boxers enter when they\u0027re beaten hard enough. And on the wall of the room were these masks. And at some point, Ali had a fight where he took a real pounding and he entered the room and he looked around at the masks and he realized that he could put one of the masks on.

And it\u0027s also the most unnatural. You have to psych up. You have to transform yourself. You have to do something to become the person who could put himself or herself straight into danger and throw the punch. And then, once you become that person, once you become that, then who are you?

And he loved fighting, saw himself as a bully. He was such a committed fighter that when he got older he became the first person to get suspended from Vassar College for fighting. And now he\u0027s trying to stop. He\u0027s trying to stop being the one who always throws a punch. But moving from that world into the world that most of us inhabit isn\u0027t easy. He spoke with Paul Tough."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Heidi takes a cab ride home every night, which is $8.50. And we took this ride that ended up being $11.00.

I meant to get that fixed."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"One thing led to another and I basically snapped and grabbed him and folded him up. He was outside of the cab and I was outside of the cab and I threw him inside the cab and slammed the door on his legs and he drove away."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So was it like a standoff sort of thing where the two of you were standing outside the cab sort of shoving each other?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Yeah, you pay me. You pay me. No, I won\u0027t pay you. You pay me no. No, I won\u0027t pay you. And then he said that I was an enemy of the people. Which, since he was ripping me off, seemed like a pretty outrageous claim. But I snapped, and I just charged him. That\u0027s a failing on my part. I should be able to take his number and complain to the Taxi and Limousine Commission and take him to court, do it the right way. There\u0027s always a way out of a fight."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"You were with your wife and you were with another guy. And how did the two of them react?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Sam loved it, and Heidi hated it. Heidi walked away."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Did she give you a hard time?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Oh, yeah. I had to sleep out of the house. I had to go around the corner, sleep at my mom\u0027s house. Arguably, a fair punishment."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I remember being a little kid and running away from a fight and being terrified and being blind and running and running and running and running. And it occurred to me that if people-- it\u0027s like playground fighting, but it\u0027s pretty traumatic when you\u0027re a little kid. Somebody chasing you around threatening to beat you over the head and you\u0027re just terrified about what-- you\u0027re not sure exactly what it is except that somebody said they\u0027re going to beat you over the head. So you run and you run and you run and you hope that you never get caught. And then, if you do get caught, you get a beating on the head. It\u0027s more humiliating than it is hurtful. But at some point you decide, well, I\u0027m not going to be the guy being chased in the playground. I\u0027m going to do the chasing. It\u0027s as much to avoid the humiliation of having to run away as it is really enjoying doling it out. Although you quickly learn to enjoy being a bully."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"But you\u0027re saying there was a moment where you made that decision for yourself?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Yeah, I thought if you can choose to be the guy throwing the beating, then you might as well be that guy instead of the guy getting the beating."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"The things that I learned early on were you prepare for a fight way ahead of time. If you\u0027re going to go out at night, you wear big shoes because you end up on the floor getting dragged around and sometimes you have to kick people. Always throw the first punch. Punch in the throat and the eyes, the nuts, and the knees. Don\u0027t bother with any other part of the body if you want to win the fight. Never tell anybody you\u0027re going to fight them. Just punch them."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"It\u0027s important to be the guy who can throw the punch to me. And it\u0027s more important than whether or not you win the fights or not, I think. But it\u0027s a hard thing to do, to throw a punch. Because you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen afterwards. Then you get your ass kicked, and it\u0027s happened a lot. You throw a punch and then they come back at you 10 at a time and you lost that one."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Before I got into fights, or before I had my first fight and was mostly running away from fights, everything seemed to happen really, really quickly. Never was clear in your memory what had happened and why you were running down the street or the panic. But after the first fight, I realized that if you actually get in a fight, everything slows down. I suppose it\u0027s adrenaline. You have time to think about everything. It\u0027s like being in a car crash. You notice things-- what people are looking at, what the person you\u0027re about to fight with is looking at, what he\u0027s paying attention to, where his hands are, if he\u0027s the kind of guy who\u0027s going to hit you first, all that stuff. You have this heightened awareness. It doesn\u0027t hurt then, but it\u0027s scary. But nothing hurts really."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Really? So when you\u0027re in a fight there\u0027s no pain at all?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I mean, I\u0027m sure that there is, but it\u0027s not unbearable pain. You don\u0027t give up because of the pain. And I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been beaten bad enough so that you would-- I\u0027ve never been beaten with a bat so that things break and start working. But being punched doesn\u0027t really hurt. It\u0027s just exhausting. That\u0027s why fights don\u0027t last very long. It\u0027s too exhausting."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It\u0027s exhausting to punch something, or it\u0027s exhausting to get punched by somebody?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Both."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"How is that exhausting?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"It takes a lot of energy to punch somebody, and it hurts a lot when you do it. I know that you\u0027re never more tired than after you\u0027ve gotten a good beating or you\u0027ve given one. And it doesn\u0027t seem to be any more tiring getting beaten than beating up somebody."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"We were at some college bar and somebody came running over all dramatic and flushed and said Evan was in the hospital and had his teeth knocked out by the rugby team. So we all got in this car and drove to the hospital-- I think it was St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie-- and stormed the emergency room through the double doors, screaming Evan\u0027s name, looking for Evan, feeling very excitable. And Evan appeared from behind the screen. I\u0027ll never forget his face. His front two teeth were just gone, and his lips were all swollen He had these big eye like, big, puppy dog eyes. And he\u0027s speaking with a lisp, talking to us. And very dramatically somebody-- it was probably me-- said, what do you want to do? Do you want to go get them, or do you want to call college court in the morning and press charges? Because we can\u0027t do both."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It was kind of a little bit of a movie moment?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Oh, God. It\u0027s hideous, yeah. And so Evan of course said, with his big lips said, let\u0027s get them."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"About eight of us went to a bar off campus where we knew the rugby team would be. And we called them out to have a fight."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What do you mean? How\u0027d you do that?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"We opened the door and started screaming at them to come out and fight. We\u0027d been drinking for the most part of the evening, so I don\u0027t remember exactly what it was that was said. Anyway, 11 guys piled out of the bar with about five rugby girls, the women who hung around with the rugby team. And Evan started insulting the women, which just incited everybody. Including actually, the rugby coach was there as well. A guy named Dennis. And at some point Dennis got upset because Evan was insulting his girlfriend and rushed Evan. And Evan ran away. And poor Evan had had his teeth knocked out already. But that wasn\u0027t good for morale for the troops. Because everybody but me and the two other guys named John left."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"And the fight had already progressed to a point where we were in a circle of guys and it was about to happen. So there was no real going back. And I\u0027ll never forget watching John-- the bigger of the two Johns-- grab a guy named Andy by the balls and by the throat and lift him up over his shoulders and over a bush, where he just disappeared. There were no more Andy. And then he clapped his hands, cleaned his hands, and walked away across the street to find somebody else to punch."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Now I remember seeing that while I was getting the back of my head and the front of my head pounded at the same time by two other guys. Every time I turned around to face somebody to fight them, the guy behind me would punch me in the back of the head. And I remember thinking, this is how people die in fights. This is what happens. You get hit so hard that your neck breaks."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"And then I heard this inhuman scream. And I looked on the floor, and there was the other John, the smaller of the two Johns. And the rugby coach had three fingers of John\u0027s hand is his mouth. And there was blood rimming from his mouth. He was chewing on John\u0027s fingers. And John couldn\u0027t move, and his hands were being chewed on. I was so freaked out by that. I walked over and I kicked the coach in his head as hard as I could. And his jaw sprung open, and he sort of looked around. And he got up. And so it was me and the coach facing each other. And he just started walking towards me. And I started walking backwards. And he just kept coming. And I thought, well, I can walk all the way home. He\u0027s just going to follow me, so I better just stop. And then I stopped and as he came towards me, I set my foot and took that step forward and I punched him as hard as I could in the face. Harder than I\u0027ve ever punched anybody in my life. And he fell over."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"And first of all, it hurt like hell. My hand hurt. And I thought, wow, I knocked out the coach. But he popped up, like one of those Bozo the Clown punching dolls. He was on the ground for a second before he was standing up again."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"A second where everything was working out."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Time slows down. And he just kept coming. And so I turned around to run away. And I turned around and ran into a visiting alumni whose name was Bear. And he was so much bigger than me. He just got me in a bear hug, which I guess what he\u0027s named for. And he turned me on my head, and he dropped me on my face on the concrete, right on the curb. And then the coach stood on my head and started stomping my head into the road. And it\u0027s one of those suburban roads that are paved with gravel. And so I got all the skin torn off the high point on my face, above my eye and on my chin and on my jaw. And then mercifully, we all heard police sirens."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I remember seeing Dennis the next morning after breakfast. My face was still all raw, and he had this big, black eye. I looked at his face and he looked at my face and we sort of apologized to each other in that way without saying I\u0027m sorry. And we got along fine after that. We never had any trouble. And that\u0027s true for the rest of the team. If anything, we all never spoke about it again. But we all got along much better afterwards."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you feel like there\u0027s some fights in which it\u0027s just like-- I mean if you\u0027re at a bar and you\u0027re with some people who want to fight and there\u0027s other people who want to fight, I mean that\u0027s just-- everybody wins?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"Yeah, it\u0027s a win-win. We used to do that. We\u0027d just fight with each other. John broke a chair over my head once. Over my back, not really my head when I was getting up from him throwing me on the ground. And it was fine. It was part of the fun. We decided to have a fight. He poked me, I poked him. He punched me, I punched him and then we were going. And it wasn\u0027t play fighting at all."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I would really, really, really feel bad about myself if I did any of the things that I did then, now. I suppose at some point it doesn\u0027t seem appropriate anymore to be behaving that way, to be looking for a fight. I see it differently. Besides my wife."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So do you feel like-- I mean, you talked about this one moment on the schoolyard where you decided you were going to be the guy who punched instead of the guy who got punched. Do you feel like now you\u0027re trying to make the opposite decision, you\u0027re trying to become the guy who runs away again?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I have the self-confidence now, I think, having been a bully, that I can do without it. I wouldn\u0027t be satisfied with that answer if I had never done it, if I had gone from running away to finding a solution to the problem. I\u0027d always be haunted by the-- why didn\u0027t you just pound the guy into the ground, see if that doesn\u0027t solve the problem. And a lot of times it does. It\u0027s really fun sometimes. Square off against a guy in a bar and you know before the fight starts that you\u0027re just going to kick his ass. And he\u0027s a schmuck, and he\u0027s starting a fight with you. And he\u0027s starting a fight with you with his arms at his sides and he\u0027s leading with his face. You just can\u0027t wait for him to say enough for you to just pop him in the face. Have it be done with and hopefully you really humiliate him. That\u0027s fun."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So even now you would still feel that way in a bar if there was a guy just being clearly the idiot? You\u0027d take the first swing and you\u0027d feel good about it?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I don\u0027t know. Part of me would like to say yes, definitely. And part of me knows that I wouldn\u0027t do that anymore. In fact, I was thinking about this the other day. I wondered if I would turn the other cheek if something happened. I just don\u0027t think I would. I don\u0027t have the strength, the fortitude, to do that."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What do you think of that line in the Bible of turning the other cheek?"},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"I don\u0027t even know where to start with it. I don\u0027t know where to start with it. I can only understand it as a metaphor. I don\u0027t know how you apply it. I\u0027ve only ever been in situations since I decided that I was going to be the guy throwing the punches, not getting them that I looked for the fight. So I\u0027m the other end of the spectrum. One day I\u0027ll probably slug Jesus. I don\u0027t think that I\u0027ve got what it takes to take a hit. I\u0027ve spent so much time defining myself as a guy who never would."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"We have a neighbor who has a dog who barks all the time, and I used to get in big screaming matches with him about the dog. His behavior as a neighbor is outrageous. He\u0027s a bad neighbor. He should be punished. But I can\u0027t punish him. I\u0027m not the one who\u0027s going to do the punishing. So I made that decision. And when I think about this particular instance, I think there was a time when I would have fed the dog steel wool or broken glass or something and then created a situation where the dog was dead and I obviously did it. And then there would be a fight and I could muster all the moral righteousness for being falsely accused of killing this dog and then beating the guy up as well. That sounds like something I would-- I love the idea of it now. But I know that I\u0027m not going to poison the guy\u0027s dog. So we\u0027re just going to keep going around and around in this horrible circle where I frown at him when he says hi to me and I let him know that I disapprove of him."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"That\u0027s the problem with the world where you don\u0027t throw punches, things just go on and on."},{"speakerName":"Manny Howard","text":"It\u0027s true. Exactly right. No quick resolution."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Manny Howard still lives in Brooklyn where he writes a column about bars for the New York Press and does other writing. He talked to This American Life senior editor Paul Tough."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"When is fighting cathartic?

Let\u0027s say George Foreman. And he\u0027s the referee of the match. He\u0027s the Judge Wapner of this thing.

We have this story of loving to fight from Meema Spadola."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza was an accountant, a financial analyst at a huge insurance company. She was living day to day like anybody else. Then she heard about this boxing class that was being offered at the company gym. Some guy named Milton was teaching. Maritza liked sports. She\u0027d even taken an aerobic boxing class before, so she decided to go down and check it out."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Here I am in a suit, coming in. It\u0027s the first time. I didn\u0027t have a chance to change. So I\u0027m walking in all suited up. So he comes in, he\u0027s saying well, you know, I\u0027m hear to teach boxing. I said, well, so? And? I wasn\u0027t impressed."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"So Maritza comes up and she\u0027s so short. She goes, I want to get rid of my stomach. I want to get rid of my gut. And so she was so short. I look at her. I go, honey, I teach boxing. This ain\u0027t boxing aerobics. You know, aero boxing. This is boxing. You want to learn how to box, you came to the right place. If you want to come and dance around, jump around, I says, I\u0027m not the guy for you. So this ain\u0027t what you want."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"He wasn\u0027t even thinking about me. There\u0027s another girl who thinks this is aero-- I mean-- so I threw a punch at him. Oh, you got a pretty good punch there. And he goes, let me see what you got. Bam, bam. You got a pretty good punch there, he goes. But who taught you how to box? Two steps. Then he\u0027s like trying to fix me. I\u0027m going to teach you how to weave, but I\u0027m going to shine you up like an old shoe and polish you up. He made me laugh. I thought he was amusing. I found it amusing.

She\u0027d grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was back so close to the streets."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn\u0027t tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn\u0027t approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton\u0027s, his first girl, so she\u0027d spar with the men there."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"She took Joey one day and she was throwing nonstop combinations and punches repetitiously. There was an old man sitting down in the chair and he goes, god damn that boy can throw some punches. She had the head gear on. So when she finished he came over to me. He goes, that\u0027s going to be one good damn fighter. That boy is going to be great. He goes, who is that? I go, what guy you talking about? He goes, that guy. I go, I hate to tell you this, that\u0027s no guy. He goes, what do you mean, that\u0027s no guy? Looked like a guy. I go, that\u0027s a girl. That ain\u0027t no damn girl. I go, that\u0027s a girl. He goes, get out of here. So I said, Maritza come here. So she come over to me and I took off her head gear. I go, does she look like a girl now? He goes, oh."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Looking at Maritza, you probably wouldn\u0027t think boxer. She\u0027s small, just over 5 feet tall and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She\u0027s radiant. It\u0027s like speaking to someone who\u0027s had a religious conversion."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Boxing has shed a light on me. It\u0027s like my vision. It\u0027s like I just obtained vision. This is what I was put here for."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, tonight\u0027s next bout is the women\u0027s 106 pound class. The referee is Pete Santiago. In the gold corner, Maritza Arroyo, from the Supreme Team Boxing Club. Arroyo is a financial analyst and a part-time personal trainer. She\u0027s been boxing for a year and is a Metros champ. This is her first--"},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"With Milton\u0027s training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in \u002796 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought."},{"speakerName":"Commentator","text":"Two straight left hands by Arroyo. And another straight left. Four straight left hands by Arroyo."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her \u002796 Golden Gloves win. The Garden\u0027s packed. The crowd\u0027s going wild. Martiza\u0027s incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She\u0027s calculated. The woman she\u0027s fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza\u0027s up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"There goes the upper cuts. There goes another one to the body."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Ow."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Another one to the body. Another one. Another one."},{"speakerName":"Commentator","text":"And another. Followed by a big right hook. Manson in trouble."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch, straight to Maritza\u0027s face. Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"There, there goes the hook. See that? That\u0027s it. 10 seconds. Bam. There you go. I threw it all. Go, go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. Throw it. I missed a lot, but I threw."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Can we just watch the last 10 seconds? That was so cool. Oh my God, you are so good, Maritza. I want to see you fight so badly."},{"text":"After the fight ends, we\u0027re laughing. We keep rewinding to watch Maritza\u0027s amazing finale."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"I\u0027m like, really? You got it good, right? Well, OK. All right. All right. All right. All right. OK, OK. That was a grin. That was a good grin."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"We\u0027re both completely high and hysterical. Maritza\u0027s face is transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way, it\u0027s terrible because we both know she\u0027s quitting boxing."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing. She\u0027s only 106 pounds. They don\u0027t even have a name for her weight class. If she went pro, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her. As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she\u0027s always been put up against these same two opponents over and over. And she\u0027s beat them every time."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza\u0027s lucky enough to have found the thing she loves, the thing that makes her life complete, but unlucky enough that the timing worked out all wrong. More women are getting into boxing all the time and starting younger. In 10 years, there may be enough women that Maritza would be able to make a career of it. But she\u0027s already in her 30s. She says she has to be realistic about the future. So she\u0027s gone back to school, and she\u0027s working full-time."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"I get mixed feelings. When I go into the gym, I want to do it. But when I come away from the gym and I start looking at reality, it\u0027s like, I\u0027m sad. It\u0027s a sadness."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"On the outside, no one sees it. But on the inside it\u0027s like it died. It\u0027s like, God, it could have been you. You should be in there boxing."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"It\u0027s like she\u0027s in love with someone she knows she has to leave. So she circles around boxing, quits, comes back for one night stands."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Last year, Milton signed her up for the Metros tournament without telling her. On the night of the fight, he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her. Maritza got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn, while Milton lied to the judges about Maritza being stuck in traffic. She arrived, beat in her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to retire that she left without even collecting her trophy. But being back in the game felt too good and after that win, she just couldn\u0027t bring herself to walk away. Despite her reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York Gloves and, of course, won."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"For his part, Milton had no reservations. Maritza will always be his best girl, his first girl. But he\u0027s now becoming resigned to the fact that she doesn\u0027t have much time left in boxing."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"She boxes like street people were to call [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in his prime. She\u0027s slick. She\u0027s smart. She thinks in there. She doesn\u0027t really get hit. She don\u0027t let you give her a beating. She hands out the beatings."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"You know, I wish I would\u0027ve found her when she was a little bit younger. A lot younger."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Here\u0027s how hard this is for Maritza. Even her plans for retirement from boxing include boxing. She\u0027s training to be a massage therapist. To massage boxers, she says. She quit her job as an accountant and now works full-time as a trainer in a gym. She has this theory that she\u0027ll get over boxing by going to boxing matches all the time."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Maybe I\u0027ll overcome it by being there. Maybe that\u0027s what I need to do, is to face it. To face the fact that finally I\u0027m not doing it anymore, that I\u0027m not going to be boxing anymore. Maybe that\u0027s what I need."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"Go. There it is. That\u0027s good. Come out here real quick. There you go. See the difference? Go."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"In February, just after Maritza misses the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton\u0027s gym to see her fight. Even though these days Maritza isn\u0027t there much anymore, Milton has promised me that Maritza will spar with a new girl he\u0027s training. We wait and wait and no Maritza. An hour passes."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"When she finally shows, she looks worn out and tired. She\u0027s not dressed to box, and she says she\u0027s got the flu. She\u0027s not going to fight. Right away everyone starts pushing her."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Well, let\u0027s just do a little."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"You want to? But I got nothing with me."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"What do you need?"},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Everything. I don\u0027t have nothing."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"She says she didn\u0027t bring her shoes. She doesn\u0027t have any of her gear. Milton points to some shoes lying in the corner, says they\u0027re her size. Suddenly Maritza doesn\u0027t look so tired."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"But I got to tell you, I have no mouthpiece."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Then Maritza drops the pretense. We head down in the elevator to her car. It turns out she\u0027s been carrying her gloves, her mouthpiece, her wraps, all of her equipment in her car for the past year just in case."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"I knew this was going to happen. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t want to come around. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t want to come."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"You\u0027ve got the biggest smile on your face. You look so happy right now."},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Because I love boxing. That\u0027s why. It\u0027s what\u0027s got me where I\u0027m at today. Very happy and very balanced I guess. We\u0027re around Second Avenue. Second Avenue. Between Second and Third and 13th Street. So here I am with no voice, going in this room to go spar. Is that crazy? That\u0027s crazy."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"She grabs her bag, and we race back to the gym. And as Maritza\u0027s getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck. Milton stands ringside, pumped up, ready to see his favorite in action again."},{"speakerName":"Howard Kelso","text":"This is Howard Kelso live right here from Supreme Team Boxing."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Box."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"Relax your shoulders, Maritza. Relax your shoulders. Too tight. Oh, good one."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"Maritza\u0027s stiff at first. Then she starts to relax. She\u0027s ducking down, dancing around the ring. And in the last 10 seconds of the fight, she has a surge of energy. She\u0027s punching hard, moving fast, throwing nonstop combinations."},{"speakerName":"Milton","text":"Come on, girls. Time."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"And afterwards, she\u0027s pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with Milton and the guys in the gym. She says she\u0027ll be back to spar and train every week. And even though she\u0027s missed the deadline for this year\u0027s Golden Gloves, she swears she\u0027ll take the gloves next year. Stay tuned for 1999, she says. Stay tuned."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"But Maritza doesn\u0027t show at Milton\u0027s the next week or the week after. She breaks two appointments with me. She doesn\u0027t return my calls. And when I finally reach her, she\u0027s angry. Angry she fought again. Scared she\u0027s getting sucked back in."},{"speakerName":"Meema Spadola","text":"And how about the fact that you\u0027re still carrying around your gear?"},{"speakerName":"Maritza Arroyo","text":"Well, I guess I can\u0027t let go of boxing yet. Maybe it\u0027s my security blanket. It\u0027s like always knowing that it\u0027s always there, that I can always hit that bag. I get in front of the mirror at my house every day. Just jab and come around and do the moves. It\u0027s my connection to boxing. I carry this with me. I sleep with it. I have gloves in my car. I love it. It\u0027s me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That story by Meema Spadola, a documentary filmmaker in New York, who also boxes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Round Three, Hard Work. Well, so far on our program we\u0027ve heard from people who love being the person who throws a punch, unofficial fighters and amateurs. This is a different kind of story. Frankie Cruz Junior boxed in the Olympics twice, won silver and bronze medals. He\u0027s a six time Florida State Golden Glove champ, four time National Golden Glove champ. And a year ago he quit amateur fighting, decided he was going to try to make a living from boxing. It\u0027s the kind of job where people try to hit and injure you for a living, but you get no health insurance. In a year Frankie\u0027s had a broken rib, broken ankle, broken hand, a case of cauliflower ear that\u0027s gone untreated. And he\u0027s not officially even gone pro yet. He spoke with This American Life producer Julie Snyder."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Frankie Cruz got his job from one punch. A year ago in a nightclub in Miami, the 170-pound Frankie knocked out a guy weighing 260 with a right hand. He says the punch brought everyone to their feet, including a middle-aged dance club owner from Chicago named Ruben Pazmino."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"That night, Ruben had a vision for his Tropicana Club, and it revolved around Frankie Cruz. Later that week, Frankie was on a plane to Chicago."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"I came in a limousine. They wanted to pick me up in a limousine. They took me to Tropicana. They treat me the nice way. It was fun."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"Let\u0027s get ready to rumble!"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning at the Tropicana, a Latino nightclub that houses four bars, a VIP room, a restaurant, and a huge dance floor with a balcony. It\u0027s 2:30 in the morning and nearly a thousand people are packed inside on a Tuesday. After the weightlifting contest and after the lip syncing and after the four erotic dancers finish massaging a shirtless man with baby oil, there\u0027s boxing in a regulation ring set up in the middle of the dance floor. It\u0027s fight night, and the star is walking in the door. It\u0027s Frankie."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"[SPEAKING SPANISH]"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Hip and beautiful Latinas turn to look at the 5 foot 10 Nicaraguan born fighter with dyed blond hair and a broken nose. He\u0027s not yet dressed in his boxing gear. Instead he wears a mustard-colored sports coat, slacks, and so much jewelry that he literally makes noise when he moves."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Here\u0027s Frankie\u0027s job. Here\u0027s the job he left his kids and family for. It\u0027s free-for-all boxing. Anyone can fight. You can fight. I could fight. Anyone. All you have to do is sign a release form agreeing that if your nose breaks, teeth get punched out, or you end up with a mild concussion, you know it\u0027s your fault for being too drunk and easily encouraged by your friends to get into a boxing ring in the first place."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"You can choose to fight your best friend, your nemesis, or you can take your chances and fight Frankie. If you knock down Frankie, you get $1,000 in cash or the mysterious grand prize. Everyone goes for the cash."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"The first guy that did it was wow, he took so much punch. He didn\u0027t want to go down. But you know, he finally quit in the second round. And then another one came, bigger. And every time bigger and bigger."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] please come to the ring."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Frankie will fight anyone who signs up. Sometimes he\u0027s boxed five or six matches in one night, an incredible feat of endurance, something no pro boxer will ever do. And Frankie gets paid the same whether he fights one guy or five guys."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"He\u0027s fought with one arm tied behind his back. He\u0027s fought three guys at once. He\u0027s fought, in all, 128 fights at the Tropicana. He\u0027s won 127."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Frankie won\u0027t say how much he gets paid, but it\u0027s not much. And he says he sends most of that money back to his ex-wife, his three children, and his grandmother in Miami. So he\u0027s broke all the time."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"For the first seven months he was in Chicago, Frankie lived in a back room of the Tropicana. He also worked as a bouncer on the nights he wasn\u0027t boxing. So for days on end, Frankie never left the club. Sometimes on a Saturday or Sunday when the business offices were closed, Frankie would be locked inside and would have to wait for the Tropicana to open in order to leave."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"He says he didn\u0027t mind it that much until Ruben, the owner, took his television set away in order to start up a new karaoke night."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"I finished fighting sometimes four or five guys in the night. I used to go outside and cry and say, why I\u0027m doing this? I think I\u0027m not getting paid enough to do it. Everything is business. And if you don\u0027t talk business good, you don\u0027t study the business good, you will never make it."},{"speakerName":"Announcer","text":"OK, uno, dos, tres, por favor!"},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Right now two African American guys from the audience have signed up to fight each other and are going at it in the ring. Both weigh well over 200 pounds. While they clumsily stumble around the ring, taking wide punches and falling against the ropes, the almost preteen-looking ring girls get instructions on what they\u0027re supposed to do when Frankie re-enters the ring."},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Walk around that way real sexy and then stop in front of the camera so he can take a picture of it. You take your robe off when you get inside the ring. And then you put your robe on before you get back out."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"The girls in thong bikinis hustle around as Frankie emerges, now wearing a blue and gold running suit, a straw cowboy hat, and a Nicaraguan scarf tied around his neck."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Frankie stands with the announcer while the two ring girls walk in circles, each holding an end of his championship belt. The belt always gets the center spotlight."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"When training, Frankie lays the belt down next to his treadmill, says a prayer, and starts running. It\u0027s on the floor next to him when he\u0027s jumping rope."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Once when I showed up to interview him at his gym, before we could go off to talk, he opened his gym bag and pulled out a little plastic stand that you use for picture frames. He put the stand on a desk facing the front door of the gym and put the belt on it."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"On one end of the belt is Frankie\u0027s name. On the other, Viva Auto Sales Park because unfortunately, the Tropicana didn\u0027t give him the belt. For several months Frankie says, he continually asked Ruben for one but kept getting blown off."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"I just thought at least to get a boxer of the year in the club. And I\u0027ve been talking about him. Do some thing special, you know? When I wanted to get the belt for him I want him to present it, give it to me. But he never gone there and told me here, Frankie. Here, go have fun. It\u0027s not fair."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Instead, a friend introduced Frankie to the owner of Viva Auto Sales. The guy agreed to buy the belt for Frankie if he could put the Viva name on it. It\u0027s a good investment. You meet Frankie, you meet the belt."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Leaving the belt with the ring girls, Frankie climbs between the ropes and gets in his corner. His managers, Danny and Hank, are there with him. They\u0027re grooming him to go pro in June. They give him a place to live. They see that he eats right, doesn\u0027t drink, and trains every day."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Frankie\u0027s opponent doesn\u0027t look too intimidating. Staggering, he enters the ring wearing jeans, a long sleeve green shirt, and Doc Martens. He\u0027s at least 240 pounds, complete with overhanging gut and love handles. It would take a lot of alcohol to make someone like this believe he belongs in a ring with a trained Olympic medalist. But he\u0027s had a lot of alcohol."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Hank and Danny size up the guy. The fact that he\u0027s drunk means his fighting may be sloppy. But it also makes it harder on Frankie because the drunks don\u0027t feel the pain as much. As the bell goes off, Hank screams instructions from the corner."},{"speakerName":"Hank","text":"Get out of there. Get out of there. Come on."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Frankie\u0027s splayed against the ropes. In a shocking move, Frankie\u0027s opponent came racing out of the corner and immediately began swinging. It\u0027s a barfighter\u0027s tactic, get in the first punch. He gets Frankie up against the ropes in the corner and on the defense, as Frankie only manages to get in a few body jabs."},{"speakerName":"Hank","text":"Punch him. Frankie, punch him. There you go! Don\u0027t let him push you around."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"It never occurred to me how hard Frankie would have to work to win his fights, how much of a beating he takes. He looks tired and confused."},{"speakerName":"Hank","text":"I want him on the floor. On the floor. On the floor."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"At the end of the first round, Hank and Danny counsel Frankie in the corner. Mostly it\u0027s a big pep talk. You\u0027re the champ, they yell. You\u0027re the champ."},{"speakerName":"Hank","text":"Frankie, hey! Show me some intensity. You know what to do. Kick his ass."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"In round two, Frankie comes back. His opponent\u0027s punches becomes weaker. At times they miss Frankie completely. And almost gently, Frankie edges the guy up against the ropes in his own corner and does combinations to his head, pounds away at him. Blood spurts everywhere."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"It\u0027s an incredible moment, satisfying in a way I never would have guessed. Sweat and spit fly off Frankie\u0027s body. Hank and Danny go wild. The crowd goes wild. Frankie breaks the guy\u0027s nose and the ref ends the fight."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"When Frankie staggers back and drops his hands, blood drips from his gloves onto the starched, white mat. Hank screams at him."},{"speakerName":"Hank","text":"Hey, that\u0027s the beating I like to see. That\u0027s the way you throw the punches."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Boxing can make you feel so small. The force of the punches is so brutal and penetrating that it\u0027s almost mythical. When Frankie climbed out of the ring, he asked me if I was impressed. I couldn\u0027t even answer. I couldn\u0027t talk to him."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"In only a few minutes, this guy who has to beg for a belt from a used car dealership suddenly seemed untouchable."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"I\u0027ve asked Frankie over and over what he loves about boxing, and he doesn\u0027t really say anything. He doesn\u0027t like hurting people. He doesn\u0027t have any romantic ideas about the tradition of boxing or its primal appeal. That\u0027s not why he boxes. It\u0027s a job. A job that doesn\u0027t pay all that much in grimy, punishing, working conditions. A job that he\u0027s good at, but that doesn\u0027t hold a lot of mystery anymore. The one thing that makes it special for Frankie is the crowds."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"What I love about boxing is the people. I think if people don\u0027t go see you, it won\u0027t be fun. I believe the people, even if they\u0027re not cheering for me, or they\u0027re booing for me-- but after I win or after I finish the fight, I know I got all those people who didn\u0027t cheer for me, they\u0027re going to give me their hands and they\u0027re going to say, wow, you had a great fight."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"After his match, Frankie begins jumping around, running through the crowds up to the top floor of the nightclub, looking for fans. He does this every time, Hank says. When Frankie sees me, he stops and motions for me to follow, so I can record how much the crowd loves him."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Frankie."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"Yeah, baby."},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"Congratulations, brother. You\u0027re getting bigger and bigger, baby."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"I\u0027m getting better and better too."},{"speakerName":"Frankie Cruz","text":"[INTERPOSING VOICES]"},{"speakerName":"Man","text":"That\u0027s right. You knocked that guy pretty good, esse."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"Out of the ring looking for attention, Frankie doesn\u0027t seem like a giant anymore. He\u0027s a guy, boyish even."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"A lot of people come over and shake his hand, say a word. A lot more push right by him, heading down to the ring where six women from the audience are now taking part in a do-it-yourself strip tease. Men in the audience pull dollar bills from their wallets and shove past. They don\u0027t look at Frankie."},{"speakerName":"Julie Snyder","text":"[MEN CHANT \"TAKE IT OFF\"]"},{"speakerName":"Woman","text":"Oh, it\u0027s Lisa\u0027s birthday today, y\u0027all.
