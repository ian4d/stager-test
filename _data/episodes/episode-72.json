One\u0027s white, one\u0027s black. And they went there because there\u0027s something about South Africa for them and for many Americans, something familiar and unfamiliar at the same time in a way that makes it mesmerizing."

What is important, however, is that all nations must march toward increasing freedom, toward justice for all. You must do this not because it is economically advantageous, although it is, not because the laws of God commanded, although they do, we must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do."

Once Nelson Mandela got out of prison, and especially after he entered the president\u0027s office, it\u0027s been black Americans who look to South Africa for inspiration. A few years ago, I did a series of stories for National Public Radio with a South African reporter, comparing race relations in the US with race relations in South Africa. And one of the most striking differences between the way that blacks in the two countries saw things was blacks in South Africa, they said they had hope."

Today, we\u0027ve devoted our entire program to the story of two guys who look to South Africa that way. Their names are Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson. Both of them grew up in the normal morass of post-civil rights race relations in this country, went to schools that were integrated but where blacks and whites usually stayed separate, rarely mixed."

A land which was once the importer of slaves and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America."

Now servants\u0027 quarters are being made more luxurious and they\u0027re more like a little kind of garden cottage, granny flat kind of thing, because we might have to move into them one day and rent the house after the servants."

        "The new South Africa wasn\u0027t working out the way they expected. They complained that since the ANC took power, the mail service is horrible, there\u0027s litter in the streets, the government\u0027s corrupt.",
        "Actually, yeah, we have. On dirt roads, the dudes driving cars with the buzz cuts and crazy-looking eyes, tanned skin. Don\u0027t you think those are Boers? Don\u0027t you think they look like that? The little buzz-cut guy?",
        "The fact is, I came to South Africa hoping to confront real racists. In America now, racism is like this cloud that\u0027s still surrounding us, but you can\u0027t touch it or see it. You just feel it when you go to a party or when you go into a store. But in South Africa, white oppression officially just ended two years ago. I came here thinking it would be like seeing what it was like during the bus boycotts in the \u002760s or during the Civil War. I came here looking for the enemy.",
        "It\u0027s been several months since we\u0027ve been back and we haven\u0027t had a single fight.",
        "Boer.",
        "Boer. I can\u0027t do it.",
        "Boer. Boer.",
        "We had somehow wandered into a techno version of America in the \u002760s. But if America\u0027s \u002760s were about rebellion, it wasn\u0027t clear from anyone we talked to who or what, exactly, Rustler\u0027s meant to be rebelling against. In the smoky bar near the dance floor, we met the founder of Rustler\u0027s. He\u0027s 40-something with a pony tail, beard, and an African wrap that covered his hairy legs to the knees. His name was Frick. He explained the enemy.",
        "So the American government was the enemy, and the solution was the ethnic peoples. The only problem was, there were no ethnic peoples there. In a country made up of Zulus, Ndebele, Sotho, and Xhosa, a country with 12 official native languages, besides the kitchen workers and occasional gardener, I was the only black person at Rustler\u0027s. Josh and I did a little informal survey. Why no black people?",
        "Say \"Boer.\"",
        "Rustler\u0027s Valley wasn\u0027t really a part of the new South Africa. It was more like a theme park for recreational drug users, a summer camp escape for young, white South Africans where they didn\u0027t have to think about the crime rates or the futures in this country. After two hazy days, when we finally got back into our room, we found a young, blond-haired woman sprawled across one of our beds rolling a joint in the bedspread. It was 5:00 in the morning. We\u0027d had enough. We asked her to leave.",
        "Oh, yeah. Sure. Don\u0027t you think?",
        "It\u0027s that expectation. I walked in the main room. They had a couple people behind the desk. And two or three people were hanging out. And they were having at least two conversations, possibly three. You know, different groups of people. Not many people, six to eight people. And I walked in the room, closed the door, and everyone\u0027s quiet. Literally, I mean, come on. Two or three conversations didn\u0027t just happen to end at right the exact same moment I walked in the door. But you know, I open my mouth, I say a couple words, I make a joke, and it lightens everything up for them, and they feel, \"OK, that\u0027s all right. That\u0027s cool.\"",
        "But I only am able to do that because I know that if I prove to them that I\u0027m from out of the country, then they\u0027ll feel comfortable again, like they\u0027re not having-- like, it\u0027s something that they can feel cool about. Every time I see somebody, I try to talk and make witty jokes so that it\u0027s easier.",
        "In a mosque in Cape Town, we met a group called PAGAD, short for People Against Gangsterism And Drugs. They\u0027re a little like that group DARE that we have back in the States, except instead of soccer moms, these guys are Islamic fundamentalists.",
        "[PRAYING]",
        "Say it.",
        "It was time to return to Johannesburg to say goodbye to Josh\u0027s family and then escape from South Africa. We had been getting along fine since we left the Seftels two weeks earlier. No fighting. But now, with only four hours of highway between us and them, the tension returned. I was driving. Josh and the microphone were facing me. They had me cornered.",
        "I don\u0027t think whiteys here are automatically racist.",
        "Well, I\u0027m sure that I did not say there are active or inactive racists and there are not two categories. And we can replay the tape as many times, Mr. Seftel, as we need to.",
        "It\u0027s a two-story house still under construction. It doesn\u0027t really look like a huge breast. It\u0027s just got lots of curved walls and curved ceilings and a lot of breasty ornamentation.",
        "It was hard to dislike Louis. He was such an entertainer, I don\u0027t even think he took himself seriously. In our time in Johannesburg, he took us out, offered to lend us his car, invited friends of his over so we\u0027d have people to meet. The more I spent in South Africa, the harder and harder it was for me to tell the good guys from the bad guys.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "But there were still times I didn\u0027t know what to make of people like Louis. For instance, camped out in the middle of a half-built house in the rain were at least a half dozen black men who had built a fire in the middle of the living room.",
        "He showed us the kitchen and the bedrooms and the living room and a small servants\u0027 quarters attached to the side of the house.",
        "That\u0027s going to be a mainstay of Africa then. Servants forever.",
        "Well, I mean, how couldn\u0027t you? They\u0027re rich, they\u0027ve got bad-ass houses, they\u0027ve got servants, you know. It\u0027s like people living in the South that still have domestic slaves. I mean, I guess it is a job for somebody, but it just gives you bad reminders of what it was and what was.",
        "I think they\u0027re good people, and I\u0027m glad we had a chance to meet them.",

        "Do you think we\u0027ve seen a lot of Boers?",
        "On this visit, they seem more beleaguered than anything else. They told us about all their friends who\u0027d been robbed and attacked. Molly explained how she\u0027d been mugged at knife point.",
        "Not long ago, Molly had been famous and powerful. She was an actress who had been in lots of plays and a few films. She was the first white actress to appear on stage with a black. Her husband Monty had been a politician and had served as the mayor of Johannesburg during the \u002770s. But he died a few months before we arrived. Now she lived by herself in a big house with a big wall surrounding it. She was alone, except for her black servants.",
        "One of the turning points in her life as a South African, one of the moments that changed her from an activist into the person she\u0027s become, was the day that the Seftels had waited for for years, the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison. The day started off just fine.",
        "And they\u0027re scared. I mean, they\u0027re scared in their own homes.",
        "Now, most of the young people in the family are leaving. One of Molly\u0027s children has emigrated, and one of Harold\u0027s. And another of Harold\u0027s sons is probably leaving soon. Harold told me that in 15 years, there will be hardly any Seftels left in South Africa.",
        "Even at this last dinner, even getting along with them as well as we were, there were still things about my South African relatives we didn\u0027t completely understand. And it might have been impolite, but we just asked them over and over. What did they do during apartheid, if they felt guilty?",
        "What\u0027s the right word?",
        "I guess I don\u0027t-- I\u0027m not looking for Boers. I only notice it when you say it.",
        "So that was it. Now that we\u0027re back in the States, Rich and I never really talk about what happened in South Africa. I guess we\u0027ve said everything there is to say to each other.",
        "Which didn\u0027t bother me, as long as Rich wasn\u0027t looking for my family to be that enemy.",
        "That\u0027s good. That\u0027s good.",
        "Do Boer.",
        "We had read about a place called Rustler\u0027s Valley in our guidebook. It said that Rustler\u0027s was one of the most progressive places in the country, maybe on the continent, a kind of ongoing South African Woodstock. When we got there, there were lots of hippie-looking people with long beards, toting aboriginal instruments and bongos. The horticulture there looked like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. On one hillside, it looked like someone was holding a VW van convention. On another hillside, we joined a group of people who were in the middle of experiencing \"a sound journey.\"",
        "They all sat in a circle with their eyes closed and their legs crossed. In the middle of the circle was a man with a bunch of instruments. He was blowing on a didgeridoo. When he stopped, they went around the circle talking about how the sound journey had made them feel.",
        "Down by the river, it was like Eden. There were people swimming naked and horses drinking from water and running wild. A group of two women and two men were passing around reefers the size of small cigars. But most of the action at Rustler\u0027s took place around a giant, flaming globe. At night, hundreds of kids danced to techno music in the firelight. Next to the dance floor was a pool where nude swimming was encouraged. There was a room called The Passion Pit, with low couches, dim lighting, and intertwined bodies. There was the tepee village. Rich and I went down there and ran into this guy wearing moccasins, knickers, and a feather headdress. He rolled a joint and talked to us about Rustler\u0027s philosophy.",
        "Back in the States, I almost never notice race. But since I\u0027d been in South Africa, I found myself noticing it whenever Rich and I walked into a room. I\u0027d look around and think, are there any black people here? I worried he\u0027d be uncomfortable.",
        "Do you feel like they\u0027re treating you differently than they\u0027re treating me as a white person?",
        "I don\u0027t know.",
        "Boer.",
        "In the morning, the sound journey people were at it again. They sat cross-legged in a tight circle with their eyes closed. And when the man in the middle swirled his didgeridoo around the head of an entranced, red-haired woman, a steady stream of spit splattered onto her forehead and her eyelids. She didn\u0027t seem to notice. As we were driving out of Rustler\u0027s, someone approached the car and gave us a bulging sandwich bag full of marijuana and a bumper sticker. It said, \"Pot will save the world.\"",
        "PAGAD is famous for their method of getting people to just say no. They go to a drug dealer\u0027s house, pull him into the street, and set him on fire. There had been an incident like this six month earlier. A drug dealer had been burned to death in the street. And PAGAD felt their part in the incident had been misrepresented in the press. Their legal adviser, who had been quiet until then, explained PAGAD\u0027s side.",
        "5,000 people. As I sat there imagining what I would do if 5,000 people showed up at my doorstep, the legal adviser turned to us.",
        "Where was I?",
        "As I fumbled for an answer, [? Tohfi ?] explained how drinking, naked dancing, nightclubs, and abortions are all destroying the new South Africa.",
        "[PRAYING]",
        "I get the sense that when you meet a white person here, you make the assumption that they\u0027re racist until proven innocent.",
        "Boer. I am a Boer.",
        "I mean, that\u0027s what you said before. I\u0027ll play the tape for you a little bit later. But you did say that.",
        "Back in Johannesburg, my cousin Louis took us on a tour of his latest masterpiece. Louis is an architect.",
        "Well, let me ask you this. Why do you put so many breast shapes in your architecture?",
        "Who are those guys in the rain by the fire?",
        "Where do they live?",
        "On the cement floor?",
        "That means I don\u0027t like you.",
        "Is it nice in there?",
        "Wait, can you say that again?",
        "On this last visit to Johannesburg, we stayed with my family at Dolly\u0027s house. And this time, they really felt like family. Late one night after Rich went to sleep, I talked with Dolly in the kitchen about the ups and downs of my love life. She urged me to marry a Jewish girl. It was just like talking to any of my relatives.",
        "When I first got to South Africa, I had been more willing to judge Dolly and the others. But now that I had seen more of the country, I didn\u0027t feel that way anymore.

And they followed me. They grabbed my bag. And they were pulling me along the ground. And I was screaming. I mean, I had every sound coming from me. I don\u0027t know where it came from.",
        "And they must have been doing this for about three minutes, when coming towards us was an elderly white couple. They must have been in their \u002770s. And the man pulled out a gun, and he shot the one on this side of me. And I said, \"And him too! Him too!\"",
        "Well, it was total euphoria. Our family got on a plane and we flew to Cape Town and we stood in the square and waited for Mandela to come. And we waited and waited and waited and waited. And in the meantime, in the-- and it got hot as Hades. My friend who was with me, she was punched in the stomach and her camera was stolen. It was an enormous crowd of people. And they were crushing you and crushing-- eventually, you didn\u0027t have any space to breathe. And we must have been there for about six hours when we decided we must get out of here, because we began to fear for our safety. It was that sort of encroachment on our territory. And this is what\u0027s happening now.",

And we wanted also to fantasize about being black Americans rather than black South Africans, because the intensification of suffering in South Africa was just too great.

So you know, this was a movement in the opposite direction to where we were moving."

            "From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, the story of two Americans who went to South Africa. One\u0027s white, one\u0027s black. And they went there because there\u0027s something about South Africa for them and for many Americans, something familiar and unfamiliar at the same time in a way that makes it mesmerizing.",
            "Now, of course, the situation is reversed. Once Nelson Mandela got out of prison, and especially after he entered the president\u0027s office, it\u0027s been black Americans who look to South Africa for inspiration. A few years ago, I did a series of stories for National Public Radio with a South African reporter, comparing race relations in the US with race relations in South Africa. And one of the most striking differences between the way that blacks in the two countries saw things was blacks in South Africa, they said they had hope.",
            "Of course, it isn\u0027t just black Americans who look to South Africa to see a place where things are changing, where things are getting better in small ways. Today, we\u0027ve devoted our entire program to the story of two guys who look to South Africa that way. Their names are Josh Seftel and Rich Robinson. Both of them grew up in the normal morass of post-civil rights race relations in this country, went to schools that were integrated but where blacks and whites usually stayed separate, rarely mixed.",
            "So they headed to the new South Africa for a few weeks. And it turns out they did not agree on what they saw there. What we bring you today is partly a story of the emerging multiracial society over there and partly a story about the one here at home to contemplate this 4th of July weekend. Rich starts our story.",
            "Robert Kennedy described this congruence of nations as well as anybody. In 1966, he was visiting South Africa. And he began a speech at the University of Cape Town this way--",
            "That stunned pause before the audience begins applauding, I think that\u0027s so beautiful. More than England or France or Israel, more than Canada or Japan, when we think of South Africa, it is a more interesting mirror of the United States than nearly any country. I think because we glimpse a distant echo of the most frightening parts of our own country and the most inspiring parts.",
            "In the 1950s and \u002760s, black South Africans looked to the US for inspiration. Lewis Nkosi lived in Sophiatown. He remembers reading American literature like Langston Hughes\u0027 Simple Speaks His Mind.",
            "\"Harlem was like our neighborhood,\" Lewis Nkosi says. Black South Africans in Sophiatown listened to Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, tried to dress and talk like Lena Horne and Cab Calloway. In Sophiatown, gang members modeled themselves after Hollywood movies, dressed in zoot suits, picked up phrases from tough guy films like Street with No Name."

A few years ago, I did a series of stories for National Public Radio with a South African reporter, comparing race relations in the US with race relations in South Africa.

And it was just I didn\u0027t realize how even the most liberal whites aren\u0027t necessarily the most-- they\u0027re proud that they have Lisa in their family because that way they can say that they are, in fact, the most liberal whites.",

And I started to feel bad, and I started not wanting to be there. You missed it, though. When you left the room and it was just all of us in the room, we had nothing to talk about. They didn\u0027t want to talk to me at all. I mean, there was noticeable silence, and there was nothing going on.",

Home burglaries have increased only 11%. The biggest increase in crime is non-residential robberies, which is up 50%, and rape, which is up 36%. What\u0027s happening is that crime in the white areas is now becoming the same as it\u0027s always been in the black townships.",

They told us a story about why black men\u0027s noses are flat and white men\u0027s noses are long. They asked me if I was a relative of Michael Jackson. And they complained about the new South Africa. Wayne said if he were president, he\u0027d enact a much more radical redistribution than Nelson Mandela has.",

            "For these guys, the new South Africa was a lot like the old South Africa. They were still without water and work, and they still felt powerless. Apartheid had done more than just separate the races. It had created a lasting sense of black inferiority.",

Blacks and whites together, Pac-man, and personal pagers. We went to the Pita Palace for a celebratory souvlaki, and there, our celebration was cut short.",

I grew up in the city. My parents are public high school teachers. He\u0027s white, I\u0027m black, but none of this has ever been an issue. Before this trip, I don\u0027t think we ever had one serious talk about race.",

We decided to begin our search in a neighborhood called Yeoville. The free magazine they give you on the plane had an article about it. Lots of glossy pictures of blacks and whites laughing together in the streets, drinking together in bars and clubs, eating together in restaurants.",

            "It was just one of those situations where you never forget you\u0027re the only black person in the room. After eating, Louis took us on a short tour of their estate. We saw their expensive bedrooms, pools, Jacuzzis, and finally, tucked around the back of the house, was the servants\u0027 quarters, which consisted of a tiny main room with four beds and a closet-sized bathroom. One worker was in the room at the time watching a dim black-and-white TV. Beside his head on the wall was a photocopy of a game board.",
            "Louis told us that this was a lottery game. If you picked the right square, you won the pot for that week. I asked him who played. He pointed to the servant and said in a patronizing tone, that all of \"them\" do. The servant shook his head to say that he did not play, but Louis repeated that \"all blacks played.\"",
            "Later, there was this awkward moment-- awkward for me, anyway-- when Dolly and Louis were talking about Harold\u0027s daughter, Lisa.",
            "Well, I don\u0027t know how she meant it, but that sweeping statement about what all blacks are like, all blacks are unfaithful, that did it for me. That let me know who they were.",

            "Back at the hotel, we talked about dinner.",
            "It\u0027s almost like you don\u0027t want to like them.",
            "You honestly believe that most white South African families are more liberal or as liberal as them?",
            "I\u0027m not taking that away from you.",
            "You want to fight more? Hm?",
            "I\u0027m white.",
            "I guess I\u0027m saying that-- I don\u0027t know. I mean, I was pleasantly surprised that they were less racist than I could ever have expected.",
            "Rich needed a break from my family. So when Molly came to pick us up for breakfast, I went alone. She gave me a driving tour of the neighborhood.",
            "We drove through peaceful, leafy neighborhoods with big houses. But almost every house was surrounded by a high fence and barbed wire. One neighborhood had a manned checkpoint to keep people out who didn\u0027t belong. Another had armed security guards patrolling the tree-lined streets on bicycle. We drove past an area that looked like a golf course with a neatly manicured lawn. And right by the curb, half-hidden by the shrubbery, were maybe half a dozen black people, sitting and laying on the ground.",
            "That\u0027s amazing, because this looks like a very well-off neighborhood, and right on the edge, there are squatters.",
            "We were back at her house. She pulled her car up to the big gates and punched in a code. Metal doors slowly parted and we drove in.",
            "We rented a tiny Volkswagen and set out to see more of the new South Africa. We drove for hours over green, rolling hills. The deeper we got into the country, the fewer and fewer white faces we saw. Every so often, we\u0027d see a cluster of pink and aquamarine huts on a hillside, a village. Finally, we stopped at one.",
            "Standing over by the pay phone, his girlfriend was plump and rosy in an African print jumpsuit and a red cashmere Kangol beret.",
            "One of the guys had an old accordion out on the car seat. I asked him to play a song and he did. \"A Roman hymn,\" he told us.",
            "On the way out of the village, we ran into three teenage village girls. One of them wore a thick layer of white face paint, like a mask. She said it was for pimples. We were talking, and they were teaching us how to say hello in Xhosa. And then the girl with face paint turned and looked us over. She looked at Rich\u0027s skin, which was a few shades later than her own. Then see looked at mine, which was a few shades lighter still. Then she looked at both of us. \"Are you brothers?\" She asked us.",
            "Do think that Yeoville is maybe one of the best places right now because it\u0027s mixed?",
            "What\u0027s that?",
            "I had another reason for wanting to visit South Africa. I had just gotten a letter from some South African guy named Benzion Seftel asking if we might be related. My family\u0027s very small. Besides my parents and two sisters, there\u0027s only a few Seftels in all of North America. I guess I was simultaneously excited and scared. I mean, it\u0027s not every day that the size of your family suddenly doubles.",
            "What does it say?",
            "Your girlfriend just paged you from across the room?",
            "What\u0027s your girlfriend\u0027s name?",
            "Mary. If you came into this store five years ago with Mary-- a white woman, black man-- what would have happened?",
            "You would have been dead eight years ago?",
            "But when they\u0027re white South Africans, all these questions pop into your head, the first and most obvious question being, \"So do they hate black people?\" I mean, what do you do when your family doubles in size but the new half is a bunch of white supremacists? I decided not to share any of these worries with Rich.",
            "Why? What would have happened?",
            "Dimitri, the owner of the Pita Palace.",
            "A lot of white people are leaving?",
            "You\u0027re going to leave soon?",
            "Over the next few days, we would hear Dimitri\u0027s story over and over. Wherever we went, people talked about crime and fear and whites leaving. That night when we walked home through the dark streets of Johannesburg, we found a shiny bullet shell on the pavement. We took a cab the rest of the way home.",
            "[RUNNING WATER]",
            "About what?",
            "Going to see--",
            "[ELECTRIC RAZOR]",
            "--the people that I think are my relatives. That\u0027s why I\u0027m shaving.",
            "Well, I\u0027ve talked to them on the phone once-- twice.",
            "I can only hope so.",
            "Not really. I mean, it could be interesting.",
            "I\u0027m just afraid that they\u0027re going to be racist and they\u0027re going to hate you because you\u0027re black, and that you\u0027d never forgive me for it.",
            "Perhaps.",
            "So here we are with my long-lost family. Sitting around a big table piled with lasagna and fresh baked bread, are Harold Seftel, his sisters Dolly and Molly Seftel, Dolly\u0027s son Louis, and Rich and I. They reminded me of my relatives back is Schenectady.",
            "Now, Uncle Borach is which person here?",
            "That\u0027s Louie, the little boy in the picture?",
            "And then Uncle Borach is him?",
            "Yeoville\u0027s a party. The street is lined with outdoor cafes, people are wearing Nike T-shirts, New York Yankees hats, all kinds of American stuff. The scene is just like the magazine pictures. Blacks and whites talk together and drive by us in BMWs and Mercedes. When Rich and I go into a convenience store to get a drink, there\u0027s a tall black man wearing a Public Enemy T-shirt in the corner. He\u0027s playing Pac-Man.",
            "Oh, really?",
            "There\u0027s something about meeting distant relatives so far from home. There\u0027s this immediate bond that\u0027s basic and powerful, this feeling like you\u0027re all players on the same team, even though you\u0027ve just met. But at the same time, mainly because Rich was there with me, I was nervous and wanted to know what the people around the dinner table had done during apartheid.",
            "It\u0027s embarrassing to think about now, but I asked them repeatedly to talk about those years. At first, they were reluctant to discuss it, but finally they did. I was relieved to find out that Harold, a tall, lean, 60-year-old with squinty eyes, not only knows Nelson Mandela, he\u0027s one of his doctors. After Mandela came out of prison, he invited Harold and his kids for lunch. During apartheid, Molly was active in a group called The Black Sash, which picketed outside the court buildings.",
            "It turns out, Harold\u0027s son David used to drive around giving medical care to black activists who were too scared to go into the state hospitals. Harold\u0027s daughter Lisa is a member of Mandela\u0027s party, the ANC. She was arrested and imprisoned for several months during the struggle and had to go into hiding underground for years. For a while, Lisa\u0027s Aunt Dolly and Dolly\u0027s son Louis, who are less political, let her stay at their house.",
            "Even though Louis seemed to have some problems with the ANC, Harold knew Mandela, Lisa was in the ANC, Molly was protesting in the streets. As far as I was concerned, my family passed the test. My fear that they would be a bunch of white supremacists was put to rest and I felt relieved.",
            "I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t quite understand what was tangibly so harsh about--"

Don\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t do it.\" And she walks up to the gate, and he says, \"Oh, Madam! God bless you.\" And she said, \"And don\u0027t you ever dare come here again!\" And he jumped back.

Sitting across from Josh and I are three PAGAD spokesmen, crammed into tiny desks meant for elementary students. Despite the 80-degree weather, they\u0027re wearing heavy ski jackets. They each have their own cellular phones, which interrupt us constantly throughout the interview. Their leader is As-Salaam [? Tohfi ?], a giant Indian man with enormous hands. He dabs his brow with a light blue terrycloth hanky.",

Whether that meant belonging to an alternative community or being an anti-drug crusader, killing Americans and burning drug dealers or smoking dope.",

But then I realized what he was looking for. Josh didn\u0027t want my opinion on racism or the innocence of whites. Josh wanted me, as a black person, to admit that his white South African family were the good guys.",

They\u0027re the group of whites who actually voted for apartheid and built the apartheid state. And Rich had become obsessed with them. Every white person was suspect, especially in the countryside."

Now servants\u0027 quarters are being made more luxurious and they\u0027re more like a little kind of garden cottage, granny flat kind of thing, because we might have to move into them one day and rent the house after the servants."

            "Another day, another dinner with Josh\u0027s family. Our goodbye dinner. The conversation revolved around a few ongoing obsessions.",
            "The new South Africa wasn\u0027t working out the way they expected. They complained that since the ANC took power, the mail service is horrible, there\u0027s litter in the streets, the government\u0027s corrupt.",
            "Actually, yeah, we have. On dirt roads, the dudes driving cars with the buzz cuts and crazy-looking eyes, tanned skin. Don\u0027t you think those are Boers? Don\u0027t you think they look like that? The little buzz-cut guy?",
            "The fact is, I came to South Africa hoping to confront real racists. In America now, racism is like this cloud that\u0027s still surrounding us, but you can\u0027t touch it or see it. You just feel it when you go to a party or when you go into a store. But in South Africa, white oppression officially just ended two years ago. I came here thinking it would be like seeing what it was like during the bus boycotts in the \u002760s or during the Civil War. I came here looking for the enemy.",
            "It\u0027s been several months since we\u0027ve been back and we haven\u0027t had a single fight.",
            "Boer.",
            "Boer. I can\u0027t do it.",
            "Boer. Boer.",
            "We had somehow wandered into a techno version of America in the \u002760s. But if America\u0027s \u002760s were about rebellion, it wasn\u0027t clear from anyone we talked to who or what, exactly, Rustler\u0027s meant to be rebelling against. In the smoky bar near the dance floor, we met the founder of Rustler\u0027s. He\u0027s 40-something with a pony tail, beard, and an African wrap that covered his hairy legs to the knees. His name was Frick. He explained the enemy.",
            "So the American government was the enemy, and the solution was the ethnic peoples. The only problem was, there were no ethnic peoples there. In a country made up of Zulus, Ndebele, Sotho, and Xhosa, a country with 12 official native languages, besides the kitchen workers and occasional gardener, I was the only black person at Rustler\u0027s. Josh and I did a little informal survey. Why no black people?",
            "Say \"Boer.\"",
            "Rustler\u0027s Valley wasn\u0027t really a part of the new South Africa. It was more like a theme park for recreational drug users, a summer camp escape for young, white South Africans where they didn\u0027t have to think about the crime rates or the futures in this country. After two hazy days, when we finally got back into our room, we found a young, blond-haired woman sprawled across one of our beds rolling a joint in the bedspread. It was 5:00 in the morning. We\u0027d had enough. We asked her to leave.",
            "Oh, yeah. Sure. Don\u0027t you think?",
            "It\u0027s that expectation. I walked in the main room. They had a couple people behind the desk. And two or three people were hanging out. And they were having at least two conversations, possibly three. You know, different groups of people. Not many people, six to eight people. And I walked in the room, closed the door, and everyone\u0027s quiet. Literally, I mean, come on. Two or three conversations didn\u0027t just happen to end at right the exact same moment I walked in the door. But you know, I open my mouth, I say a couple words, I make a joke, and it lightens everything up for them, and they feel, \"OK, that\u0027s all right. That\u0027s cool.\"",
            "But I only am able to do that because I know that if I prove to them that I\u0027m from out of the country, then they\u0027ll feel comfortable again, like they\u0027re not having-- like, it\u0027s something that they can feel cool about. Every time I see somebody, I try to talk and make witty jokes so that it\u0027s easier.",
            "In a mosque in Cape Town, we met a group called PAGAD, short for People Against Gangsterism And Drugs. They\u0027re a little like that group DARE that we have back in the States, except instead of soccer moms, these guys are Islamic fundamentalists.",
            "[PRAYING]",
            "Say it.",
            "It was time to return to Johannesburg to say goodbye to Josh\u0027s family and then escape from South Africa. We had been getting along fine since we left the Seftels two weeks earlier. No fighting. But now, with only four hours of highway between us and them, the tension returned. I was driving. Josh and the microphone were facing me. They had me cornered.",
            "I don\u0027t think whiteys here are automatically racist.",
            "Well, I\u0027m sure that I did not say there are active or inactive racists and there are not two categories. And we can replay the tape as many times, Mr. Seftel, as we need to.",
            "It\u0027s a two-story house still under construction. It doesn\u0027t really look like a huge breast. It\u0027s just got lots of curved walls and curved ceilings and a lot of breasty ornamentation.",
            "It was hard to dislike Louis. He was such an entertainer, I don\u0027t even think he took himself seriously. In our time in Johannesburg, he took us out, offered to lend us his car, invited friends of his over so we\u0027d have people to meet. The more I spent in South Africa, the harder and harder it was for me to tell the good guys from the bad guys.",
            "What does that mean?",
            "But there were still times I didn\u0027t know what to make of people like Louis. For instance, camped out in the middle of a half-built house in the rain were at least a half dozen black men who had built a fire in the middle of the living room.",
            "He showed us the kitchen and the bedrooms and the living room and a small servants\u0027 quarters attached to the side of the house.",
            "That\u0027s going to be a mainstay of Africa then. Servants forever.",
            "Well, I mean, how couldn\u0027t you? They\u0027re rich, they\u0027ve got bad-ass houses, they\u0027ve got servants, you know. It\u0027s like people living in the South that still have domestic slaves. I mean, I guess it is a job for somebody, but it just gives you bad reminders of what it was and what was.",
            "I think they\u0027re good people, and I\u0027m glad we had a chance to meet them.",
            "But--",
            "Yeah.",
            "At the end of the day, when the chips are cashed in, they still all have servants.",
            "Do you feel like if you were here, you would have done more or less than-- what position would you be in in the Seftel family, if you were here? Do you think you would have gotten involved in the struggle, or--"

            "Do you think we\u0027ve seen a lot of Boers?",
            "On this visit, they seem more beleaguered than anything else. They told us about all their friends who\u0027d been robbed and attacked. Molly explained how she\u0027d been mugged at knife point.",
            "Not long ago, Molly had been famous and powerful. She was an actress who had been in lots of plays and a few films. She was the first white actress to appear on stage with a black. Her husband Monty had been a politician and had served as the mayor of Johannesburg during the \u002770s. But he died a few months before we arrived. Now she lived by herself in a big house with a big wall surrounding it. She was alone, except for her black servants.",
            "One of the turning points in her life as a South African, one of the moments that changed her from an activist into the person she\u0027s become, was the day that the Seftels had waited for for years, the day Nelson Mandela was released from prison. The day started off just fine.",
            "And they\u0027re scared. I mean, they\u0027re scared in their own homes.",
            "Now, most of the young people in the family are leaving. One of Molly\u0027s children has emigrated, and one of Harold\u0027s. And another of Harold\u0027s sons is probably leaving soon. Harold told me that in 15 years, there will be hardly any Seftels left in South Africa.",
            "Even at this last dinner, even getting along with them as well as we were, there were still things about my South African relatives we didn\u0027t completely understand. And it might have been impolite, but we just asked them over and over. What did they do during apartheid, if they felt guilty?",
            "What\u0027s the right word?",
            "I guess I don\u0027t-- I\u0027m not looking for Boers. I only notice it when you say it.",
            "So that was it. Now that we\u0027re back in the States, Rich and I never really talk about what happened in South Africa. I guess we\u0027ve said everything there is to say to each other.",
            "Which didn\u0027t bother me, as long as Rich wasn\u0027t looking for my family to be that enemy.",
            "That\u0027s good. That\u0027s good.",
            "Do Boer.",
            "We had read about a place called Rustler\u0027s Valley in our guidebook. It said that Rustler\u0027s was one of the most progressive places in the country, maybe on the continent, a kind of ongoing South African Woodstock. When we got there, there were lots of hippie-looking people with long beards, toting aboriginal instruments and bongos. The horticulture there looked like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. On one hillside, it looked like someone was holding a VW van convention. On another hillside, we joined a group of people who were in the middle of experiencing \"a sound journey.\"",
            "They all sat in a circle with their eyes closed and their legs crossed. In the middle of the circle was a man with a bunch of instruments. He was blowing on a didgeridoo. When he stopped, they went around the circle talking about how the sound journey had made them feel.",
            "Down by the river, it was like Eden. There were people swimming naked and horses drinking from water and running wild. A group of two women and two men were passing around reefers the size of small cigars. But most of the action at Rustler\u0027s took place around a giant, flaming globe. At night, hundreds of kids danced to techno music in the firelight. Next to the dance floor was a pool where nude swimming was encouraged. There was a room called The Passion Pit, with low couches, dim lighting, and intertwined bodies. There was the tepee village. Rich and I went down there and ran into this guy wearing moccasins, knickers, and a feather headdress. He rolled a joint and talked to us about Rustler\u0027s philosophy.",
            "Back in the States, I almost never notice race. But since I\u0027d been in South Africa, I found myself noticing it whenever Rich and I walked into a room. I\u0027d look around and think, are there any black people here? I worried he\u0027d be uncomfortable.",
            "Do you feel like they\u0027re treating you differently than they\u0027re treating me as a white person?",
            "I don\u0027t know.",
            "Boer.",
            "In the morning, the sound journey people were at it again. They sat cross-legged in a tight circle with their eyes closed. And when the man in the middle swirled his didgeridoo around the head of an entranced, red-haired woman, a steady stream of spit splattered onto her forehead and her eyelids. She didn\u0027t seem to notice. As we were driving out of Rustler\u0027s, someone approached the car and gave us a bulging sandwich bag full of marijuana and a bumper sticker. It said, \"Pot will save the world.\"",
            "PAGAD is famous for their method of getting people to just say no. They go to a drug dealer\u0027s house, pull him into the street, and set him on fire. There had been an incident like this six month earlier. A drug dealer had been burned to death in the street. And PAGAD felt their part in the incident had been misrepresented in the press. Their legal adviser, who had been quiet until then, explained PAGAD\u0027s side.",
            "5,000 people. As I sat there imagining what I would do if 5,000 people showed up at my doorstep, the legal adviser turned to us.",
            "Where was I?",
            "As I fumbled for an answer, [? Tohfi ?] explained how drinking, naked dancing, nightclubs, and abortions are all destroying the new South Africa.",
            "[PRAYING]",
            "I get the sense that when you meet a white person here, you make the assumption that they\u0027re racist until proven innocent.",
            "Boer. I am a Boer.",
            "I mean, that\u0027s what you said before. I\u0027ll play the tape for you a little bit later. But you did say that.",
            "Back in Johannesburg, my cousin Louis took us on a tour of his latest masterpiece. Louis is an architect.",
            "Well, let me ask you this. Why do you put so many breast shapes in your architecture?",
            "Who are those guys in the rain by the fire?",
            "Where do they live?",
            "On the cement floor?",
            "That means I don\u0027t like you.",
            "Is it nice in there?",
            "Wait, can you say that again?",
            "On this last visit to Johannesburg, we stayed with my family at Dolly\u0027s house. And this time, they really felt like family. Late one night after Rich went to sleep, I talked with Dolly in the kitchen about the ups and downs of my love life. She urged me to marry a Jewish girl. It was just like talking to any of my relatives.",
            "When I first got to South Africa, I had been more willing to judge Dolly and the others. But now that I had seen more of the country, I didn\u0027t feel that way anymore. I guess at some level, it just didn\u0027t feel right to judge family in the same way that judging your parents harshly for having different opinions than you do doesn\u0027t feel right. But Rich wasn\u0027t so sure.",
            "I don\u0027t feel skeptical of my family, my relatives here. I think you do. I think you feel a little bit skeptical of them.",
            "So do you like the Seftels or do you not like the Seftels?",
            "But?",
            "They\u0027re still rich and white--",
            "--at the end of the day.",
            "I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s too hard to know. I mean, there\u0027s so many variables. I would hope that I would have been involved in some way. It\u0027s like, how can you guess what you would have done? You never know."

And they followed me. They grabbed my bag. And they were pulling me along the ground. And I was screaming. I mean, I had every sound coming from me. I don\u0027t know where it came from.",
            "And they must have been doing this for about three minutes, when coming towards us was an elderly white couple. They must have been in their \u002770s. And the man pulled out a gun, and he shot the one on this side of me. And I said, \"And him too! Him too!\"",
            "Well, it was total euphoria. Our family got on a plane and we flew to Cape Town and we stood in the square and waited for Mandela to come. And we waited and waited and waited and waited. And in the meantime, in the-- and it got hot as Hades. My friend who was with me, she was punched in the stomach and her camera was stolen. It was an enormous crowd of people. And they were crushing you and crushing-- eventually, you didn\u0027t have any space to breathe. And we must have been there for about six hours when we decided we must get out of here, because we began to fear for our safety. It was that sort of encroachment on our territory. And this is what\u0027s happening now.",
