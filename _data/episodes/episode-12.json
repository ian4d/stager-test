In fact, most of the time, he\u0027d rather have me take my bicycle. So there\u0027s no question about me being slower. But as far as being clumsy, Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do. So Lovejoy and many other anthropologists think it\u0027s crazy to assume that the survival strategy of the early hominids involved running after quadrupeds. They\u0027ve just got us beat, both in terms of speed and efficiency.","But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it\u0027s a whole different ballgame.

So if I\u0027m an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?","Well, it\u0027s because he overheats. The main way that he and most other quadrupeds cool themselves when they run is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating, and then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin, because we don\u0027t have a fur coat. So we can\u0027t run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat. And when you remember that we\u0027re using twice the energy, this seems like a very strange biological paradox. And it was this paradox, combined with the argument about not being able to hunt without tools, that made my brother and I decide that it was time to try to run down an antelope.","Antilocapra americana, the pronghorn, the second-fastest land mammal on the planet.

Because instead of just seeing patterns of swarming flies, I saw leg hairs and genitals and mouths and I saw them. And I saw their lives, how they would greet each other, and what they would do. And I could see them being born. I could see them having sex. I could see them eating. I could see them flying. I could see them hanging out. And it was great. It was fascinating. So I\u0027d sit there for hours until they went to the bathroom on the glass enough that I couldn\u0027t see anymore. And that\u0027s when I kind of got hooked into animals past a certain point of return.","When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was kind of fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten, to photograph them specifically to be eaten, was repugnant and made me kind of sick. But the more I thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was.","So this is basically The Food Chain.","It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. The praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the tarantula to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators.","That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great, is she springs on it, and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out. So if they\u0027re eating leaves when she bites into it-- and this totally surprised me when it first happened. It comes out green, or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow, if you\u0027re feeding them yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different color guts coming out.","And it was just beautiful. I mean, I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome, if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than, certainly, the human world, it was very beautiful.","You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then basically the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside-down, still looking straight at you and perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of its body. And then you see his head, and his antennas are waving around, and then slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive. And then the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it.","And it took maybe, I can\u0027t remember, maybe three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long.","I got attached to the praying mantises. Yeah, seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves, like ours does, on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside. So when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them.","So that\u0027s the female. That\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. They look like a nice happy couple. He has green eyes. She has brown.","He\u0027s on top of her. And it\u0027s just like a classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours. Hours and hours and hours. I mean, I\u0027ll take a few pictures, come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes.","So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I mean I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning, and the male is nowhere to be found.","But then one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him, like she was holding him around the neck, like walking arm in arm. And she just started eating him. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that.","Here, you see he\u0027s still kind of halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there.","Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See, he\u0027s already past his waist. Whatever. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those.","When does he die?","Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position, having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, or whatever they call it in bug stuff. And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity. And when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor, and when that\u0027s gone, then she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized.","Well, he\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive, when she\u0027s only eaten his face off.","No. It takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there.","No. I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there.","She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess.","I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly.","The two of them hanging out together. Yeah. Their faces are about the same size. Well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse.","Well, hard to tell what makes something that small unhappy.","Hmm. Very strange.","It hasn\u0027t happened like this before.","No, and it has never squealed before.","The pinkie was bigger, older.","If you look at the tail, you can usually tell. When the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it up.","No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway, and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up.","Yeah, your sides change. Yeah. I mean, at one point, you feel really bad about the pinkie, and at one point, you\u0027re really happy your snake ate and therefore it\u0027s healthy and it\u0027s going to live. So in something like this, your sides always change. And when you put the pinkie up there, before you put the snake up there, you feel really bad. You think, oh, well, this little thing doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s about to be eaten. And with the Food Chain project, that was one of the points. You take the side of the underdog, and then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. And it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyways. So you just kind of get all confused, really.","It\u0027s one thing, I was telling you this before, to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet. It can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably.","No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue.","Well, you never really like something to suffer. And it definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyways.","Well, it\u0027s no different to the snake. The snake doesn\u0027t really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit, but it\u0027s dying anyways. It dies a little faster, or it dies a little slower possibly. So I cared more. The snake didn\u0027t care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go mine?"],"spokenWords":["No. I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there.","Hmm.

You know, in three-on-three or four-on-four games, in little Chicago Bulls uniforms. You know, Raccoon Scottie Pippen passes to Raccoon Dennis Rodman. Raccoon Michael Jordan, you know, takes it in for a layup or dunks it. The team is a little raccoon Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. I could see it all. But that is not what it was like. No, no, no. That was naive.","Samantha Martin chases after one of her two basketball-playing raccoons, holding a bag of blue and pink cotton candy. She alternates, actually, between taking a fingerful of cotton candy for herself and giving one to the raccoon.","Samantha is actually a skilled and successful trainer, but the animals are not cooperating this day, probably because Samantha went away for the holidays and they\u0027re still feeling neglected. Samantha puts a grapefruit-sized ball in the raccoon\u0027s hand and then pushes the raccoon\u0027s hand toward a Fisher-Price basketball net that rises perhaps a foot and a half off the floor.","The fact is, there are things that raccoons like to do, are born to do. And playing basketball is not one of them.","Taming animals means basically teaching them to conform to the human world, teaching them human expectations. And with many of the animals that Samantha raises, it\u0027s possible to make them more human while they\u0027re little. But then once they reach a certain age, their real animal nature kicks in. A baby cougar she was raising started stalking her friends, biting at their throats. The raccoons also go for the throat.","What do we want from animals?

She has rats that bowl, rats that answer toy telephones?","Act One, Staging the Food Chain in a New York Apartment.","Samantha Martin chases after one of her two basketball-playing raccoons, holding a bag of blue and pink cotton candy. She alternates, actually, between taking a fingerful of cotton candy for herself and giving one to the raccoon.","Samantha is actually a skilled and successful trainer, but the animals are not cooperating this day, probably because Samantha went away for the holidays and they\u0027re still feeling neglected. Samantha puts a grapefruit-sized ball in the raccoon\u0027s hand and then pushes the raccoon\u0027s hand toward a Fisher-Price basketball net that rises perhaps a foot and a half off the floor.","So when I heard that a woman named Samantha Martin had trained raccoons to play basketball, and hires them out for parties and corporate events, I pictured raccoons. You know, in three-on-three or four-on-four games, in little Chicago Bulls uniforms. You know, Raccoon Scottie Pippen passes to Raccoon Dennis Rodman. Raccoon Michael Jordan, you know, takes it in for a layup or dunks it. The team is a little raccoon Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. I could see it all. But that is not what it was like. No, no, no. That was naive.","Taming animals means basically teaching them to conform to the human world, teaching them human expectations. And with many of the animals that Samantha raises, it\u0027s possible to make them more human while they\u0027re little. But then once they reach a certain age, their real animal nature kicks in. A baby cougar she was raising started stalking her friends, biting at their throats. The raccoons also go for the throat.","Do people want to see animals do animal things?","The fact is, there are things that raccoons like to do, are born to do. And playing basketball is not one of them.","Most of us, the only animals we ever see are animals who act like humans-- cats and dogs. We watch movies and TV shows and commercials that are filled with animals that fetch beers from the refrigerator and solve crimes. And we forget the sheer animalness of animals. We don\u0027t see it. Maybe we don\u0027t want to see it. Well, this brings us to the topic of today\u0027s program. From WBEZ, of course, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass.

She always had a pet or two, nothing unusual. Then a few years ago, she was working on these sculptures where she would take dead insects and glue them onto plants and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flies, more than she could buy anywhere, and so she decided to start raising live flies in a glass cage in the corner of her apartment. She would just let them breed and wait for them to die. But then one day, she picked up a camera and looked at the flies through a close-up lens.","She realized that there were two basic moments of life that she couldn\u0027t see in the flies\u0027 cage. She couldn\u0027t see them eating and she couldn\u0027t see them die. So she came up with this project that she called The Food Chain. She decided to raise a few different animals-- caterpillars, praying mantises, frogs, spiders-- and take pictures of each animal eating the one that came beneath it in the natural food chain.","And so Catherine began to fill her loft with animals. There isn\u0027t much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it. Frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table. Goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs. Crickets which chirp constantly. A tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a lightbox set up, and we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures.","The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear white background.","If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers, her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing, it becomes clear to me, as she shows me her work, that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar.","You\u0027d think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That\u0027s what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo One would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and Photo Two would just show a well-fed frog.","Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally in one session at three in the morning, after staring through her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the lightbox.","At this point in The Food Chain, her pictures were becoming more and more vivid, but so was the suffering that she was watching through her lens.","One of the things that the Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which animals we love and which ones we hate, the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us, that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo. But she also finds herself drawn to the animals that we are supposed to fear, and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from.","At the lightbox, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex.","So he\u0027s on top of her.","Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick.","The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color, but they\u0027re still pretty disturbing.","What\u0027s that?","And when does he die?","Do you think he\u0027s dead there?","What do you mean, his head acts as an inhibitor?","At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage, of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute, and the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators.","Today she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a pinkie because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie.","She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all her pictures. It\u0027s chest-high, about three feet by three feet, with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus a third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm.","Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?","Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--","The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it.","It\u0027s very friendly.","I mean it just looks that way, the two of them together.","But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy.","stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move.","What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death.","This time it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs, alive, for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it.","Does the pinkie always struggle like that?","What\u0027s the difference, do you think?","Is it still alive now?","I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?","Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals we\u0027re prohibited from killing. Some we\u0027re encouraged to kill. And most of them we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing the Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals. And she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all.","And do you ever feel like you\u0027re taking sides when you set up a photograph like this?","It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie, but she\u0027s growing. Eventually she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day.","Catherine talks about her apartment being like an oasis in the middle of Soho. She loves coming home from the cars and concrete of Manhattan into a place that\u0027s filled with life. But in another way, it\u0027s Manhattan, it\u0027s our world, that\u0027s the oasis in the middle of a planet that\u0027s full of nature. All around us, things are eating and having sex and dying and suffering, and we don\u0027t notice or even think about it.","Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?","So did you feel weird at all when he was squealing at the end? Did that make you feel strange at all?","I guess there\u0027s a difference if it\u0027s being fed, if there\u0027s a purpose to it, if it\u0027s part of the chain.","At the end of our photoshoot, Catherine carefully picks up the snake and carries it back to its cage. There\u0027s a bulge about a third of the way down the snake\u0027s body where the pinkie is being digested. Before I leave, Catherine pours us a glass of wine, and we sit on the floor for a little while playing with a couple of her full-grown mice, letting them run over our hands and up our arms.

There isn\u0027t much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it. Frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table. Goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs. Crickets which chirp constantly. A tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a lightbox set up, and we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures.","stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move.","So he\u0027s on top of her.","What do you mean, his head acts as an inhibitor?","Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?","Do you think he\u0027s dead there?","It\u0027s very friendly.","Does the pinkie always struggle like that?","It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie, but she\u0027s growing. Eventually she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day.","[MUSIC -- \"INSECT COLLECTOR\" BY SHONEN KNIFE]","The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear white background.","One of the things that the Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which animals we love and which ones we hate, the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us, that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo. But she also finds herself drawn to the animals that we are supposed to fear, and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from.","Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?","Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick.","What\u0027s that?","What\u0027s the difference, do you think?","But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy.","She realized that there were two basic moments of life that she couldn\u0027t see in the flies\u0027 cage. She couldn\u0027t see them eating and she couldn\u0027t see them die. So she came up with this project that she called The Food Chain. She decided to raise a few different animals-- caterpillars, praying mantises, frogs, spiders-- and take pictures of each animal eating the one that came beneath it in the natural food chain.","Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--","The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color, but they\u0027re still pretty disturbing.","If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers, her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing, it becomes clear to me, as she shows me her work, that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar.","Today she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a pinkie because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie.","Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally in one session at three in the morning, after staring through her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the lightbox.","And when does he die?","At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage, of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute, and the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators.","The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it.","Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals we\u0027re prohibited from killing. Some we\u0027re encouraged to kill. And most of them we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing the Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals. And she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all."]},"Worm":{"name":"Worm","episodes":{"12":"Animals"},"statements":["Yes, I\u0027m a worm, true. I live in the soil. Only in rain do I earthwards unfoil.

We found a small lake, some badlands, and a rattlesnake.","Wow.","It never did get very hot that day, but in the afternoon, we had a good long chase after a female and two males. They ran in circles around an area of about 10 square miles. There were two hills and a long smooth valley in between, and the chase went up and around and back and forth between these hills, the antelope running short periods of time but covering long distances and then stopping and waiting for us to catch up. The two males ran behind the female, as if they were trying to protect her, and sometimes they\u0027d all go in different directions, but we stayed behind the female and the males would eventually rejoin her.","One thing we\u0027d learned the day before was that we could run much less distance than the antelopes by staying well inside their circle, and we were also starting to communicate with each other over long distances. For instance, if my brother was on top of one of the hills, and he could see where the antelope were going, he\u0027d point, and I wouldn\u0027t have to run to the top of the hill. So we were running after these three and feeling pretty good about not letting them ditch us, and a couple times, we even got within 50 yards of them.

Because instead of just seeing patterns of swarming flies, I saw leg hairs and genitals and mouths and I saw them. And I saw their lives, how they would greet each other, and what they would do. And I could see them being born. I could see them having sex. I could see them eating. I could see them flying. I could see them hanging out. And it was great. It was fascinating. So I\u0027d sit there for hours until they went to the bathroom on the glass enough that I couldn\u0027t see anymore. And that\u0027s when I kind of got hooked into animals past a certain point of return.","When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was kind of fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten, to photograph them specifically to be eaten, was repugnant and made me kind of sick. But the more I thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was.","So this is basically The Food Chain.","It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. The praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the tarantula to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators.","That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great, is she springs on it, and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out. So if they\u0027re eating leaves when she bites into it-- and this totally surprised me when it first happened. It comes out green, or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow, if you\u0027re feeding them yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different color guts coming out.","And it was just beautiful. I mean, I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome, if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than, certainly, the human world, it was very beautiful.","You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then basically the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside-down, still looking straight at you and perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of its body. And then you see his head, and his antennas are waving around, and then slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive. And then the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it.","And it took maybe, I can\u0027t remember, maybe three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long.","I got attached to the praying mantises. Yeah, seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves, like ours does, on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside. So when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them.","So that\u0027s the female. That\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. They look like a nice happy couple. He has green eyes. She has brown.","He\u0027s on top of her. And it\u0027s just like a classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours. Hours and hours and hours. I mean, I\u0027ll take a few pictures, come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes.","So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I mean I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning, and the male is nowhere to be found.","But then one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him, like she was holding him around the neck, like walking arm in arm. And she just started eating him. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that.","Here, you see he\u0027s still kind of halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there.","Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See, he\u0027s already past his waist. Whatever. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those.","When does he die?","Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position, having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, or whatever they call it in bug stuff. And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity. And when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor, and when that\u0027s gone, then she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized.","Well, he\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive, when she\u0027s only eaten his face off.","No. It takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there.","No. I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there.","She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess.","I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly.","The two of them hanging out together. Yeah. Their faces are about the same size. Well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse.","Well, hard to tell what makes something that small unhappy.","Hmm. Very strange.","It hasn\u0027t happened like this before.","No, and it has never squealed before.","The pinkie was bigger, older.","If you look at the tail, you can usually tell. When the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it up.","No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway, and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up.","Yeah, your sides change. Yeah. I mean, at one point, you feel really bad about the pinkie, and at one point, you\u0027re really happy your snake ate and therefore it\u0027s healthy and it\u0027s going to live. So in something like this, your sides always change. And when you put the pinkie up there, before you put the snake up there, you feel really bad. You think, oh, well, this little thing doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s about to be eaten. And with the Food Chain project, that was one of the points. You take the side of the underdog, and then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. And it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyways. So you just kind of get all confused, really.","It\u0027s one thing, I was telling you this before, to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet. It can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably.","No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue.","Well, you never really like something to suffer. And it definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyways.","Well, it\u0027s no different to the snake. The snake doesn\u0027t really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit, but it\u0027s dying anyways. It dies a little faster, or it dies a little slower possibly. So I cared more. The snake didn\u0027t care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go mine?"],"spokenWords":["No. I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there.","Hmm.

You take the side of the underdog, and then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. And it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyways. So you just kind of get all confused, really.","It\u0027s one thing, I was telling you this before, to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet. It can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably.","No, and it has never squealed before.","He\u0027s on top of her. And it\u0027s just like a classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours. Hours and hours and hours. I mean, I\u0027ll take a few pictures, come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes.","And it took maybe, I can\u0027t remember, maybe three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long.","Well, hard to tell what makes something that small unhappy.","So that\u0027s the female. That\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. They look like a nice happy couple. He has green eyes. She has brown.","Here, you see he\u0027s still kind of halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there.","It hasn\u0027t happened like this before.","Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position, having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, or whatever they call it in bug stuff. And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity. And when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor, and when that\u0027s gone, then she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized.","That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great, is she springs on it, and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out. So if they\u0027re eating leaves when she bites into it-- and this totally surprised me when it first happened. It comes out green, or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow, if you\u0027re feeding them yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different color guts coming out.","And it was just beautiful. I mean, I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome, if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than, certainly, the human world, it was very beautiful.","So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I mean I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning, and the male is nowhere to be found.","When does he die?","The pinkie was bigger, older.","She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess.","The two of them hanging out together. Yeah. Their faces are about the same size. Well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse.","Well, he\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive, when she\u0027s only eaten his face off.","Well, you never really like something to suffer. And it definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyways.","So this is basically The Food Chain.","No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway, and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up.","You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then basically the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside-down, still looking straight at you and perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of its body. And then you see his head, and his antennas are waving around, and then slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive. And then the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it.","No. It takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there.","No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue.","I got attached to the praying mantises. Yeah, seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves, like ours does, on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside. So when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them.","But then one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him, like she was holding him around the neck, like walking arm in arm. And she just started eating him. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that.","It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. The praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the tarantula to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators.","When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was kind of fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten, to photograph them specifically to be eaten, was repugnant and made me kind of sick. But the more I thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was.","Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See, he\u0027s already past his waist. Whatever. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those.","I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly.","If you look at the tail, you can usually tell. When the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it up."]},"Ira Glass":{"name":"Ira Glass","episodes":{"12":"Animals"},"statements":["Act One.

She always had a pet or two, nothing unusual. Then a few years ago, she was working on these sculptures where she would take dead insects and glue them onto plants and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flies, more than she could buy anywhere, and so she decided to start raising live flies in a glass cage in the corner of her apartment. She would just let them breed and wait for them to die. But then one day, she picked up a camera and looked at the flies through a close-up lens.","She realized that there were two basic moments of life that she couldn\u0027t see in the flies\u0027 cage. She couldn\u0027t see them eating and she couldn\u0027t see them die. So she came up with this project that she called The Food Chain. She decided to raise a few different animals-- caterpillars, praying mantises, frogs, spiders-- and take pictures of each animal eating the one that came beneath it in the natural food chain.","And so Catherine began to fill her loft with animals. There isn\u0027t much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it. Frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table. Goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs. Crickets which chirp constantly. A tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a lightbox set up, and we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures.","The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear white background.","If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers, her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing, it becomes clear to me, as she shows me her work, that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar.","You\u0027d think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That\u0027s what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo One would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and Photo Two would just show a well-fed frog.","Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally in one session at three in the morning, after staring through her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the lightbox.","At this point in The Food Chain, her pictures were becoming more and more vivid, but so was the suffering that she was watching through her lens.","One of the things that the Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which animals we love and which ones we hate, the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us, that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo. But she also finds herself drawn to the animals that we are supposed to fear, and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from.","At the lightbox, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex.","So he\u0027s on top of her.","Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick.","The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color, but they\u0027re still pretty disturbing.","What\u0027s that?","And when does he die?","Do you think he\u0027s dead there?","What do you mean, his head acts as an inhibitor?","At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage, of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute, and the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators.","Today she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a pinkie because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie.","She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all her pictures. It\u0027s chest-high, about three feet by three feet, with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus a third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm.","Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?","Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--","The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it.","It\u0027s very friendly.","I mean it just looks that way, the two of them together.","But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy.","stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move.","What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death.","This time it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs, alive, for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it.","Does the pinkie always struggle like that?","What\u0027s the difference, do you think?","Is it still alive now?","I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?","Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals we\u0027re prohibited from killing. Some we\u0027re encouraged to kill. And most of them we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing the Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals. And she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all.","And do you ever feel like you\u0027re taking sides when you set up a photograph like this?","It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie, but she\u0027s growing. Eventually she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day.","Catherine talks about her apartment being like an oasis in the middle of Soho. She loves coming home from the cars and concrete of Manhattan into a place that\u0027s filled with life. But in another way, it\u0027s Manhattan, it\u0027s our world, that\u0027s the oasis in the middle of a planet that\u0027s full of nature. All around us, things are eating and having sex and dying and suffering, and we don\u0027t notice or even think about it.","Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?","So did you feel weird at all when he was squealing at the end? Did that make you feel strange at all?","I guess there\u0027s a difference if it\u0027s being fed, if there\u0027s a purpose to it, if it\u0027s part of the chain.","At the end of our photoshoot, Catherine carefully picks up the snake and carries it back to its cage. There\u0027s a bulge about a third of the way down the snake\u0027s body where the pinkie is being digested.

On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a lightbox set up, and we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"So this is basically The Food Chain."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear white background."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. The praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the tarantula to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers, her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing, it becomes clear to me, as she shows me her work, that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great, is she springs on it, and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out. So if they\u0027re eating leaves when she bites into it-- and this totally surprised me when it first happened. It comes out green, or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow, if you\u0027re feeding them yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different color guts coming out."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"And it was just beautiful. I mean, I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome, if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than, certainly, the human world, it was very beautiful."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"You\u0027d think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That\u0027s what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo One would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and Photo Two would just show a well-fed frog."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally in one session at three in the morning, after staring through her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the lightbox."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then basically the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside-down, still looking straight at you and perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of its body. And then you see his head, and his antennas are waving around, and then slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive. And then the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"And it took maybe, I can\u0027t remember, maybe three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At this point in The Food Chain, her pictures were becoming more and more vivid, but so was the suffering that she was watching through her lens."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"I got attached to the praying mantises. Yeah, seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves, like ours does, on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside. So when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"One of the things that the Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which animals we love and which ones we hate, the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us, that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo. But she also finds herself drawn to the animals that we are supposed to fear, and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At the lightbox, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"So that\u0027s the female. That\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. They look like a nice happy couple. He has green eyes. She has brown."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So he\u0027s on top of her."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"He\u0027s on top of her. And it\u0027s just like a classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours. Hours and hours and hours. I mean, I\u0027ll take a few pictures, come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I mean I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning, and the male is nowhere to be found."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"But then one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him, like she was holding him around the neck, like walking arm in arm. And she just started eating him. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color, but they\u0027re still pretty disturbing."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Here, you see he\u0027s still kind of halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What\u0027s that?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See, he\u0027s already past his waist. Whatever. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"And when does he die?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"When does he die?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you think he\u0027s dead there?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position, having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, or whatever they call it in bug stuff. And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity. And when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor, and when that\u0027s gone, then she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What do you mean, his head acts as an inhibitor?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, he\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive, when she\u0027s only eaten his face off."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage, of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute, and the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Today she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a pinkie because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all her pictures. It\u0027s chest-high, about three feet by three feet, with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus a third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No. It takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No. I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It\u0027s very friendly."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"I mean it just looks that way, the two of them together."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"The two of them hanging out together. Yeah. Their faces are about the same size. Well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, hard to tell what makes something that small unhappy."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Hmm. Very strange."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"It hasn\u0027t happened like this before."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"This time it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs, alive, for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Does the pinkie always struggle like that?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No, and it has never squealed before."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What\u0027s the difference, do you think?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"The pinkie was bigger, older."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Is it still alive now?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"If you look at the tail, you can usually tell. When the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it up."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway, and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals we\u0027re prohibited from killing. Some we\u0027re encouraged to kill. And most of them we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing the Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals. And she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"And do you ever feel like you\u0027re taking sides when you set up a photograph like this?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Yeah, your sides change. Yeah. I mean, at one point, you feel really bad about the pinkie, and at one point, you\u0027re really happy your snake ate and therefore it\u0027s healthy and it\u0027s going to live. So in something like this, your sides always change. And when you put the pinkie up there, before you put the snake up there, you feel really bad. You think, oh, well, this little thing doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s about to be eaten. And with the Food Chain project, that was one of the points. You take the side of the underdog, and then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. And it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyways. So you just kind of get all confused, really."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie, but she\u0027s growing. Eventually she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"It\u0027s one thing, I was telling you this before, to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet. It can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Catherine talks about her apartment being like an oasis in the middle of Soho. She loves coming home from the cars and concrete of Manhattan into a place that\u0027s filled with life. But in another way, it\u0027s Manhattan, it\u0027s our world, that\u0027s the oasis in the middle of a planet that\u0027s full of nature. All around us, things are eating and having sex and dying and suffering, and we don\u0027t notice or even think about it."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So did you feel weird at all when he was squealing at the end? Did that make you feel strange at all?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, you never really like something to suffer. And it definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyways."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"I guess there\u0027s a difference if it\u0027s being fed, if there\u0027s a purpose to it, if it\u0027s part of the chain."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, it\u0027s no different to the snake. The snake doesn\u0027t really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit, but it\u0027s dying anyways. It dies a little faster, or it dies a little slower possibly. So I cared more. The snake didn\u0027t care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go mine?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At the end of our photoshoot, Catherine carefully picks up the snake and carries it back to its cage. There\u0027s a bulge about a third of the way down the snake\u0027s body where the pinkie is being digested. Before I leave, Catherine pours us a glass of wine, and we sit on the floor for a little while playing with a couple of her full-grown mice, letting them run over our hands and up our arms. They\u0027re tiny and warm, and through their fur, we can feel their little hearts beating."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"[MUSIC -- \"INSECT COLLECTOR\" BY SHONEN KNIFE]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Paul Tough.

It\u0027s a scientific argument, so it takes a few minutes to explain."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Remember the scene in 2001, where an ape-man realizes he can use a bone as a weapon and murders another ape-man? Then he throws the bone in the air and it becomes a space station orbiting the earth. The theory behind this scene is that we separated from the apes when we stood upright and freed our hands to make and use tools, especially weapon-type tools for hunting and killing other animals. It\u0027s called the hunting hypothesis, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with it except that we don\u0027t have any physical evidence to support it. We just haven\u0027t found any tools or weapons that are that old."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Well, some of the work that my brother does as a biologist made him interested in another theory of human evolution. You might call it the running hypothesis. He believed that he and I were probably good enough runners to be able to run down big game without using any weapons at all. And he thought that if we could do it, then maybe our early ancestors could have done it too."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Shortly before we went to Wyoming, I went to see Owen Lovejoy. He teaches anthropology at Kent State University. We talked about the running hypothesis, and he thought it was pretty funny."},{"speakerName":"Owen Lovejoy","text":"I mean, think about it for a minute. I mean, what game are they going to run down? Things like wildebeest or something?"},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Uh-huh. Zebra."},{"speakerName":"Owen Lovejoy","text":"And they\u0027re just going to start off running after this thing without any advanced weaponry of any kind. They\u0027ve got no spears, no bow and arrow, and they just start running after a wildebeest."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Yeah. Well, I think that\u0027s the idea, that they--"},{"speakerName":"Owen Lovejoy","text":"Uh-huh. The weak link in that whole behavior that you\u0027re describing is the inability of the animal to run any faster because it\u0027s so damn slow. And it\u0027s so damn slow because it\u0027s a clumsy biped. Is that an animal adapted to hunting? Slow, awkward, little, no olfaction, no protective vision. If it were an effective quadruped, it could do everything that you\u0027re describing in half the time. I mean, imagine a bunch of Paiute Indians that could run as rapidly and as successful as a German Shepherd dog. They\u0027d catch the thing in three minutes and devour it."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Well, I just happen to have a German Shepherd, and I take him with me when I go running."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Let\u0027s go."},{"text":"And Lovejoy\u0027s right. He\u0027s a better runner than I am. In fact, most of the time, he\u0027d rather have me take my bicycle. So there\u0027s no question about me being slower. But as far as being clumsy, Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do. So Lovejoy and many other anthropologists think it\u0027s crazy to assume that the survival strategy of the early hominids involved running after quadrupeds. They\u0027ve just got us beat, both in terms of speed and efficiency."},{"text":"But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it\u0027s a whole different ballgame. He\u0027ll come with me and run for a while, but then he walks and lags behind. And sometimes he just goes home. So if I\u0027m an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?"},{"text":"Well, it\u0027s because he overheats. The main way that he and most other quadrupeds cool themselves when they run is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating, and then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin, because we don\u0027t have a fur coat. So we can\u0027t run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat. And when you remember that we\u0027re using twice the energy, this seems like a very strange biological paradox. And it was this paradox, combined with the argument about not being able to hunt without tools, that made my brother and I decide that it was time to try to run down an antelope."},{"text":"Antilocapra americana, the pronghorn, the second-fastest land mammal on the planet. We thought that if we could keep one running for two hours on a hot day, we\u0027d have it beat."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"What happened?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"They didn\u0027t give me a chance. I was able to follow them for about 30 minutes, but the problem was I wasn\u0027t sure if I was following the same ones I started following. Because I started out following four-- a buck, two does, and a younger one. And after about 10 minutes, they ran into a group of about five more antelope, went over a hill. And then on the other side of the hill, they broke into two groups again. And so I think I ended up following the same four, but I couldn\u0027t be sure. And I followed them for another 15 minutes, and then they ran into a much larger group, ran for a ways. And I followed that larger group for a while, and then that group broke into at least two more groups."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"And at that point I just sort of gave up and quit following them, because I didn\u0027t know which individuals I was chasing. And then I got confused on the roads. Where\u0027s the road we were on? Down here? OK, what happened was I came out on this road, way over there somewhere. And I got lost. I didn\u0027t know, really, where I was. I was walking along that road for about 15 minutes. I felt like that was the wrong direction. So we started over there. They ran a circle there. I don\u0027t remember crossing this road, but I must have, originally, early on."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"This one?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"They ran in a circle. They came back."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Hey there listeners, I\u0027m just going to interrupt right here. This is an old episode from 1996, and we have a music rights issue. So we can\u0027t play you this next little patch of the story. But I\u0027m just going to summarize it for you, very briefly. It\u0027s not that long of a section."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Basically, what happens is, Scott and his brother talk about what to do next. And his brother says they should go out and look for more. Scott asks, you mean forget about these? And his brother says he doesn\u0027t know where these ones went."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Scott writes, It could have been the Serengeti-- orange and green and purple plains, a hot sun, thin high clouds, blue mountains on the horizon. It could have been the Serengeti, but we were no primitive hunters. We quickly realized we knew nothing about the animal we were chasing or the land we were running on. We ran after several herds that first day without much success."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Alright, we\u0027ll pick up the story from there."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"That night, sleeping out, I remember feeling very high in terms of elevation, like being dizzy. There weren\u0027t any clouds in the sky, and it just seemed like too much open space. Satellites in orbit, the moon in orbit, and antelope in the bushes, chewing their cuds and laughing amongst themselves."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"The next morning, we ate a breakfast of chocolate chip cookies and orange juice, and walked around waiting for the air to heat up."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"What is it?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"It\u0027s a white-tailed jackrabbit."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"We found dead animals, bare bones, an abandoned house."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"You think someone used to live here?"},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"We saw dust devils, horned toads, an eagle. We found a small lake, some badlands, and a rattlesnake."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"It never did get very hot that day, but in the afternoon, we had a good long chase after a female and two males. They ran in circles around an area of about 10 square miles. There were two hills and a long smooth valley in between, and the chase went up and around and back and forth between these hills, the antelope running short periods of time but covering long distances and then stopping and waiting for us to catch up. The two males ran behind the female, as if they were trying to protect her, and sometimes they\u0027d all go in different directions, but we stayed behind the female and the males would eventually rejoin her."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"One thing we\u0027d learned the day before was that we could run much less distance than the antelopes by staying well inside their circle, and we were also starting to communicate with each other over long distances. For instance, if my brother was on top of one of the hills, and he could see where the antelope were going, he\u0027d point, and I wouldn\u0027t have to run to the top of the hill. So we were running after these three and feeling pretty good about not letting them ditch us, and a couple times, we even got within 50 yards of them. And I\u0027d look into their eyes, trying to see some sign of fear or fatigue, but all I kept seeing were very quiet animals that seemed to know exactly who we were, what we were proposing, and didn\u0027t seem to be in the least bit worried."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Anyway, we ran after these three for about an hour, and then they found a large herd, or the herd found them. And they ran up and over a hill, and by the time we got to the top of the hill, the herd had split into three groups of about three or four antelopes each. And each of the groups seemed to have at least one female that looked exactly like the one we\u0027d started chasing-- the magic shell game trick again. We weren\u0027t really all that physically tired, mainly mentally beaten, and we went home."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"I haven\u0027t gone back to Wyoming for the purpose of chasing antelope, but I drive through there sometimes on my way somewhere else. And one time last spring I was going east, and there was a train along the highway also going east at about the same speed. And suddenly there were three antelope running alongside the engine, chasing it. It was incredible. It was even more incredible to see the three of them simultaneously speed up, pull out in front of the engine, and fly across the tracks."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"I pulled over and waited for the train to go by, and there they were. Three young males, looking back at me with those same black eyes and hardly breathing at all."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In the years since he first recorded that story, Scott has put it into a collection of his stories, a book called, simply, Running After Antelope."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC -- \"I WAN\u0027NA BE LIKE YOU\" BY LOUIS PRIMA]"}]},"5":{"actNumber":5,"actName":"Credits","contributorMap":{"Samantha Martin":{"name":"Samantha Martin","episodes":{"12":"Animals"},"statements":["Must bite, must bite, must-- no, no, nice, nice-- bite, must bite, must bite."],"spokenWords":["Must bite, must bite, must-- no, no, nice, nice-- bite, must bite, must bite."]},"Announcer":{"name":"Announcer","episodes":{"12":"Animals"},"statements":["PRI.

You know, in three-on-three or four-on-four games, in little Chicago Bulls uniforms. You know, Raccoon Scottie Pippen passes to Raccoon Dennis Rodman. Raccoon Michael Jordan, you know, takes it in for a layup or dunks it. The team is a little raccoon Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. I could see it all. But that is not what it was like. No, no, no. That was naive."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"Ricky. Come here, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky. Snacks, hmm? There you go. Shoo. Shoo. Ricky, shoo. Come on, Ricky. Ricky, come here."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Samantha Martin chases after one of her two basketball-playing raccoons, holding a bag of blue and pink cotton candy. She alternates, actually, between taking a fingerful of cotton candy for herself and giving one to the raccoon."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"Yummy. Sugar. Sugar, Ricky. Come here. You don\u0027t want the snacks? Ricky, Ricky, Ricky."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Samantha is actually a skilled and successful trainer, but the animals are not cooperating this day, probably because Samantha went away for the holidays and they\u0027re still feeling neglected. Samantha puts a grapefruit-sized ball in the raccoon\u0027s hand and then pushes the raccoon\u0027s hand toward a Fisher-Price basketball net that rises perhaps a foot and a half off the floor."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"Oh, she missed. Shoot again. Shoot. Good girl."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The fact is, there are things that raccoons like to do, are born to do. And playing basketball is not one of them."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"Oh, I know. It\u0027s frustrating. You have to have a lot of patience. Especially when I was first training them to play basketball, do you know how long it took me? It took me a month to get them to play basketball. Every day I had to come down here and play with ball, net, ball, net, treat. And you just see, going through their mind-- OK, if they touched the ball and then they touched the net, they\u0027d get a treat. They\u0027d be like ball, net, treat, treat. And then, I started getting them to hold the ball, and then I got them to push the ball into the net."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"And finally that day came where they picked up the ball off the ground and popped it in the net. And I was so thrilled. I was like, oh, they got it. He got excited. He was like, [PANTING SOUNDS] and he was picking up the ball and putting it in the net, picking up the ball and putting it in the net, over and over again. He got so excited."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Taming animals means basically teaching them to conform to the human world, teaching them human expectations. And with many of the animals that Samantha raises, it\u0027s possible to make them more human while they\u0027re little. But then once they reach a certain age, their real animal nature kicks in. A baby cougar she was raising started stalking her friends, biting at their throats. The raccoons also go for the throat."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"You know, if he\u0027s out of his cage, he\u0027ll run up. He\u0027ll look at you, and he\u0027ll recognize me as, like, Mom from years ago. He\u0027ll be like, Mom, and he\u0027ll race up to me, jump up, climb up to my shoulder, and then realize, wait, I\u0027m wild, I don\u0027t like you anymore. And he\u0027ll bite my neck."},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"You see it inside. Their eyes go from crazy to tame, crazy to tame, crazy, crazy, tame, tame. It\u0027s almost like they\u0027re saying, no, Mom, love you-- must bite, must bite, must-- no, no, nice, nice, Mom, nice, oh, yes, we love Mom-- bite, must bite, must bite-- no, no. They just fight it. You just see this battle going on in their heads. They\u0027re like, [SOUNDS OF STRUGGLING]."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What do we want from animals? To run her business, Samantha has had to figure this out, and at parties, at corporate events, in commercials and films, Samantha has her raccoons pick pockets and play basketball. She has rats that bowl, rats that answer toy telephones?"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do people want to see animals do animal things?"},{"speakerName":"Samantha Martin","text":"No, they don\u0027t. They want to see animals acting like people."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Most of us, the only animals we ever see are animals who act like humans-- cats and dogs. We watch movies and TV shows and commercials that are filled with animals that fetch beers from the refrigerator and solve crimes. And we forget the sheer animalness of animals. We don\u0027t see it. Maybe we don\u0027t want to see it. Well, this brings us to the topic of today\u0027s program. From WBEZ, of course, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, The Animalness of Animals. Our show today in three acts."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One, Staging the Food Chain in a New York Apartment."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Two, Animal Court. That\u0027s an original radio play by David Sedaris."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Three, The Moment Humans Stopped Being Animals. That\u0027s a story by Scott Carrier. Stay with us."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act One. You know, usually when we see pictures of animals, they\u0027re fluffy and cute or they are noble and dignified. Well, compare that to this set of photos by Catherine Chalmers. In this first picture, we have a caterpillar eating a tomato, a brightly-colored close up of that. In the second picture, a praying mantis eats the caterpillar. And in the third picture, a tarantula eats the praying mantis. Catherine Chalmers takes these pictures in her own apartment in New York City, where she also raises the animals that she feeds to each other. Paul Tough stopped by for a visit."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Growing up, Catherine Chalmers wasn\u0027t really an animal person. She always had a pet or two, nothing unusual. Then a few years ago, she was working on these sculptures where she would take dead insects and glue them onto plants and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flies, more than she could buy anywhere, and so she decided to start raising live flies in a glass cage in the corner of her apartment. She would just let them breed and wait for them to die. But then one day, she picked up a camera and looked at the flies through a close-up lens."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"And the world changed. Because instead of just seeing patterns of swarming flies, I saw leg hairs and genitals and mouths and I saw them. And I saw their lives, how they would greet each other, and what they would do. And I could see them being born. I could see them having sex. I could see them eating. I could see them flying. I could see them hanging out. And it was great. It was fascinating. So I\u0027d sit there for hours until they went to the bathroom on the glass enough that I couldn\u0027t see anymore. And that\u0027s when I kind of got hooked into animals past a certain point of return."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"She realized that there were two basic moments of life that she couldn\u0027t see in the flies\u0027 cage. She couldn\u0027t see them eating and she couldn\u0027t see them die. So she came up with this project that she called The Food Chain. She decided to raise a few different animals-- caterpillars, praying mantises, frogs, spiders-- and take pictures of each animal eating the one that came beneath it in the natural food chain."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was kind of fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten, to photograph them specifically to be eaten, was repugnant and made me kind of sick. But the more I thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"And so Catherine began to fill her loft with animals. There isn\u0027t much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it. Frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table. Goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs. Crickets which chirp constantly. A tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a lightbox set up, and we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"So this is basically The Food Chain."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear white background."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. The praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the tarantula to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers, her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing, it becomes clear to me, as she shows me her work, that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great, is she springs on it, and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out. So if they\u0027re eating leaves when she bites into it-- and this totally surprised me when it first happened. It comes out green, or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow, if you\u0027re feeding them yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different color guts coming out."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"And it was just beautiful. I mean, I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome, if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than, certainly, the human world, it was very beautiful."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"You\u0027d think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That\u0027s what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo One would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and Photo Two would just show a well-fed frog."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally in one session at three in the morning, after staring through her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the lightbox."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then basically the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside-down, still looking straight at you and perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of its body. And then you see his head, and his antennas are waving around, and then slowly the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive. And then the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"And it took maybe, I can\u0027t remember, maybe three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At this point in The Food Chain, her pictures were becoming more and more vivid, but so was the suffering that she was watching through her lens."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"I got attached to the praying mantises. Yeah, seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves, like ours does, on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside. So when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"One of the things that the Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which animals we love and which ones we hate, the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us, that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo. But she also finds herself drawn to the animals that we are supposed to fear, and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At the lightbox, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"So that\u0027s the female. That\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. They look like a nice happy couple. He has green eyes. She has brown."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So he\u0027s on top of her."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"He\u0027s on top of her. And it\u0027s just like a classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours. Hours and hours and hours. I mean, I\u0027ll take a few pictures, come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I mean I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning, and the male is nowhere to be found."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"But then one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him, like she was holding him around the neck, like walking arm in arm. And she just started eating him. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color, but they\u0027re still pretty disturbing."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Here, you see he\u0027s still kind of halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What\u0027s that?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See, he\u0027s already past his waist. Whatever. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"And when does he die?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"When does he die?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you think he\u0027s dead there?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position, having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, or whatever they call it in bug stuff. And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity. And when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor, and when that\u0027s gone, then she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What do you mean, his head acts as an inhibitor?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, he\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive, when she\u0027s only eaten his face off."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage, of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute, and the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Today she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a pinkie because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all her pictures. It\u0027s chest-high, about three feet by three feet, with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus a third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No. It takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No. I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It\u0027s very friendly."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"I mean it just looks that way, the two of them together."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"The two of them hanging out together. Yeah. Their faces are about the same size. Well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, hard to tell what makes something that small unhappy."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Hmm. Very strange."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"It hasn\u0027t happened like this before."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"This time it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs, alive, for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Does the pinkie always struggle like that?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No, and it has never squealed before."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"What\u0027s the difference, do you think?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"The pinkie was bigger, older."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Is it still alive now?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"If you look at the tail, you can usually tell. When the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it up."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway, and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals we\u0027re prohibited from killing. Some we\u0027re encouraged to kill. And most of them we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing the Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals. And she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"And do you ever feel like you\u0027re taking sides when you set up a photograph like this?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Yeah, your sides change. Yeah. I mean, at one point, you feel really bad about the pinkie, and at one point, you\u0027re really happy your snake ate and therefore it\u0027s healthy and it\u0027s going to live. So in something like this, your sides always change. And when you put the pinkie up there, before you put the snake up there, you feel really bad. You think, oh, well, this little thing doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s about to be eaten. And with the Food Chain project, that was one of the points. You take the side of the underdog, and then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. And it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyways. So you just kind of get all confused, really."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie, but she\u0027s growing. Eventually she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"It\u0027s one thing, I was telling you this before, to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet. It can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Catherine talks about her apartment being like an oasis in the middle of Soho. She loves coming home from the cars and concrete of Manhattan into a place that\u0027s filled with life. But in another way, it\u0027s Manhattan, it\u0027s our world, that\u0027s the oasis in the middle of a planet that\u0027s full of nature. All around us, things are eating and having sex and dying and suffering, and we don\u0027t notice or even think about it."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"So did you feel weird at all when he was squealing at the end? Did that make you feel strange at all?"},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, you never really like something to suffer. And it definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyways."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"I guess there\u0027s a difference if it\u0027s being fed, if there\u0027s a purpose to it, if it\u0027s part of the chain."},{"speakerName":"Catherine Chalmers","text":"Well, it\u0027s no different to the snake. The snake doesn\u0027t really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit, but it\u0027s dying anyways. It dies a little faster, or it dies a little slower possibly. So I cared more. The snake didn\u0027t care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go mine?"},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"At the end of our photoshoot, Catherine carefully picks up the snake and carries it back to its cage. There\u0027s a bulge about a third of the way down the snake\u0027s body where the pinkie is being digested. Before I leave, Catherine pours us a glass of wine, and we sit on the floor for a little while playing with a couple of her full-grown mice, letting them run over our hands and up our arms. They\u0027re tiny and warm, and through their fur, we can feel their little hearts beating."},{"speakerName":"Paul Tough","text":"[MUSIC -- \"INSECT COLLECTOR\" BY SHONEN KNIFE]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Paul Tough.

I crawled and I climbed and eventually found myself on a window ledge, me, just a worm, a fact I would like to now briefly confirm. My eyesight is faultless. I know what I\u0027ve seen. The defendant herself, the spaniel Kathleen, engaged in destruction against this thing\u0027s sweater. She used it as a sort of an appetite-whetter. She gnawed at the fabric and tugged at the collar, and knowing no way I could stop her or stall her, I stood a mute witness. I watched in disgust. I think it\u0027s appalling. I find it unjust. That dog\u0027s no puppy. She should have known better than to lie on a mattress digesting a sweater. If you want my opinion, I think you oughtta put her away.

For people who don\u0027t believe that God created the earth in six days, that moment is our origin. That\u0027s our Book of Genesis. That is the mythic point where we began. But nobody knows why these pre-humans started walking around on two legs instead of loping around on all fours the way that most animals do. There are different theories but no consensus among scientists."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, 10 years ago, Scott Carrier decided to do some research on his own, and he made this radio report."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"Oh, there they go."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"What?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"There they go. Do you see them crossing over there?"},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"No."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"Over to the right, quite a ways away in fact. Way out there."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"A couple of years ago, my brother and I went to Wyoming to run down an antelope."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"I only see three over there."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"Well, there were about eight down there."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"It was August and our plan was to chase one animal until it overheated and collapsed."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"It just took off on running."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"OK."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"Do you want to follow it?"},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"[INAUDIBLE]."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"We had good reasons for what we were doing. One was that it seemed entirely possible. Another had to do with an argument concerning human evolution. It\u0027s a scientific argument, so it takes a few minutes to explain."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Remember the scene in 2001, where an ape-man realizes he can use a bone as a weapon and murders another ape-man? Then he throws the bone in the air and it becomes a space station orbiting the earth. The theory behind this scene is that we separated from the apes when we stood upright and freed our hands to make and use tools, especially weapon-type tools for hunting and killing other animals. It\u0027s called the hunting hypothesis, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with it except that we don\u0027t have any physical evidence to support it. We just haven\u0027t found any tools or weapons that are that old."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Well, some of the work that my brother does as a biologist made him interested in another theory of human evolution. You might call it the running hypothesis. He believed that he and I were probably good enough runners to be able to run down big game without using any weapons at all. And he thought that if we could do it, then maybe our early ancestors could have done it too."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Shortly before we went to Wyoming, I went to see Owen Lovejoy. He teaches anthropology at Kent State University. We talked about the running hypothesis, and he thought it was pretty funny."},{"speakerName":"Owen Lovejoy","text":"I mean, think about it for a minute. I mean, what game are they going to run down? Things like wildebeest or something?"},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Uh-huh. Zebra."},{"speakerName":"Owen Lovejoy","text":"And they\u0027re just going to start off running after this thing without any advanced weaponry of any kind. They\u0027ve got no spears, no bow and arrow, and they just start running after a wildebeest."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Yeah. Well, I think that\u0027s the idea, that they--"},{"speakerName":"Owen Lovejoy","text":"Uh-huh. The weak link in that whole behavior that you\u0027re describing is the inability of the animal to run any faster because it\u0027s so damn slow. And it\u0027s so damn slow because it\u0027s a clumsy biped. Is that an animal adapted to hunting? Slow, awkward, little, no olfaction, no protective vision. If it were an effective quadruped, it could do everything that you\u0027re describing in half the time. I mean, imagine a bunch of Paiute Indians that could run as rapidly and as successful as a German Shepherd dog. They\u0027d catch the thing in three minutes and devour it."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Well, I just happen to have a German Shepherd, and I take him with me when I go running."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Let\u0027s go."},{"text":"And Lovejoy\u0027s right. He\u0027s a better runner than I am. In fact, most of the time, he\u0027d rather have me take my bicycle. So there\u0027s no question about me being slower. But as far as being clumsy, Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do. So Lovejoy and many other anthropologists think it\u0027s crazy to assume that the survival strategy of the early hominids involved running after quadrupeds. They\u0027ve just got us beat, both in terms of speed and efficiency."},{"text":"But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it\u0027s a whole different ballgame. He\u0027ll come with me and run for a while, but then he walks and lags behind. And sometimes he just goes home. So if I\u0027m an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?"},{"text":"Well, it\u0027s because he overheats. The main way that he and most other quadrupeds cool themselves when they run is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating, and then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin, because we don\u0027t have a fur coat. So we can\u0027t run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat. And when you remember that we\u0027re using twice the energy, this seems like a very strange biological paradox. And it was this paradox, combined with the argument about not being able to hunt without tools, that made my brother and I decide that it was time to try to run down an antelope."},{"text":"Antilocapra americana, the pronghorn, the second-fastest land mammal on the planet. We thought that if we could keep one running for two hours on a hot day, we\u0027d have it beat."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"What happened?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"They didn\u0027t give me a chance. I was able to follow them for about 30 minutes, but the problem was I wasn\u0027t sure if I was following the same ones I started following. Because I started out following four-- a buck, two does, and a younger one. And after about 10 minutes, they ran into a group of about five more antelope, went over a hill. And then on the other side of the hill, they broke into two groups again. And so I think I ended up following the same four, but I couldn\u0027t be sure. And I followed them for another 15 minutes, and then they ran into a much larger group, ran for a ways. And I followed that larger group for a while, and then that group broke into at least two more groups."},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"And at that point I just sort of gave up and quit following them, because I didn\u0027t know which individuals I was chasing. And then I got confused on the roads. Where\u0027s the road we were on? Down here? OK, what happened was I came out on this road, way over there somewhere. And I got lost. I didn\u0027t know, really, where I was. I was walking along that road for about 15 minutes. I felt like that was the wrong direction. So we started over there. They ran a circle there. I don\u0027t remember crossing this road, but I must have, originally, early on."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"This one?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"They ran in a circle. They came back."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Hey there listeners, I\u0027m just going to interrupt right here. This is an old episode from 1996, and we have a music rights issue. So we can\u0027t play you this next little patch of the story. But I\u0027m just going to summarize it for you, very briefly. It\u0027s not that long of a section."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Basically, what happens is, Scott and his brother talk about what to do next. And his brother says they should go out and look for more. Scott asks, you mean forget about these? And his brother says he doesn\u0027t know where these ones went."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Scott writes, It could have been the Serengeti-- orange and green and purple plains, a hot sun, thin high clouds, blue mountains on the horizon. It could have been the Serengeti, but we were no primitive hunters. We quickly realized we knew nothing about the animal we were chasing or the land we were running on. We ran after several herds that first day without much success."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Alright, we\u0027ll pick up the story from there."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"That night, sleeping out, I remember feeling very high in terms of elevation, like being dizzy. There weren\u0027t any clouds in the sky, and it just seemed like too much open space. Satellites in orbit, the moon in orbit, and antelope in the bushes, chewing their cuds and laughing amongst themselves."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"The next morning, we ate a breakfast of chocolate chip cookies and orange juice, and walked around waiting for the air to heat up."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"What is it?"},{"speakerName":"David Carrier","text":"It\u0027s a white-tailed jackrabbit."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"We found dead animals, bare bones, an abandoned house."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"You think someone used to live here?"},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"We saw dust devils, horned toads, an eagle. We found a small lake, some badlands, and a rattlesnake."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"It never did get very hot that day, but in the afternoon, we had a good long chase after a female and two males. They ran in circles around an area of about 10 square miles. There were two hills and a long smooth valley in between, and the chase went up and around and back and forth between these hills, the antelope running short periods of time but covering long distances and then stopping and waiting for us to catch up. The two males ran behind the female, as if they were trying to protect her, and sometimes they\u0027d all go in different directions, but we stayed behind the female and the males would eventually rejoin her."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"One thing we\u0027d learned the day before was that we could run much less distance than the antelopes by staying well inside their circle, and we were also starting to communicate with each other over long distances. For instance, if my brother was on top of one of the hills, and he could see where the antelope were going, he\u0027d point, and I wouldn\u0027t have to run to the top of the hill. So we were running after these three and feeling pretty good about not letting them ditch us, and a couple times, we even got within 50 yards of them. And I\u0027d look into their eyes, trying to see some sign of fear or fatigue, but all I kept seeing were very quiet animals that seemed to know exactly who we were, what we were proposing, and didn\u0027t seem to be in the least bit worried."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"Anyway, we ran after these three for about an hour, and then they found a large herd, or the herd found them. And they ran up and over a hill, and by the time we got to the top of the hill, the herd had split into three groups of about three or four antelopes each. And each of the groups seemed to have at least one female that looked exactly like the one we\u0027d started chasing-- the magic shell game trick again. We weren\u0027t really all that physically tired, mainly mentally beaten, and we went home."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"I haven\u0027t gone back to Wyoming for the purpose of chasing antelope, but I drive through there sometimes on my way somewhere else. And one time last spring I was going east, and there was a train along the highway also going east at about the same speed. And suddenly there were three antelope running alongside the engine, chasing it. It was incredible. It was even more incredible to see the three of them simultaneously speed up, pull out in front of the engine, and fly across the tracks."},{"speakerName":"Scott Carrier","text":"I pulled over and waited for the train to go by, and there they were. Three young males, looking back at me with those same black eyes and hardly breathing at all."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In the years since he first recorded that story, Scott has put it into a collection of his stories, a book called, simply, Running After Antelope."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC -- \"I WAN\u0027NA BE LIKE YOU\" BY LOUIS PRIMA]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Well, the great Louis Prima, from The Jungle Book soundtrack.
