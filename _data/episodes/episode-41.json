        "I think what we\u0027re dealing with is a kind of crucial transitional moment in American politics. And it\u0027s actually change that\u0027s occurred over the last couple of elections from an era where network television dominated the political campaign toward a point where cable television is dominating the campaign and looking toward a point when cyberspace or the online communities will dominate. Each of those medium have different properties which candidates have to respond to and shape their campaigns around.",
        "So if we go back eight years to Bush versus Dukakis, Bush was a paramount politician of an era of network television. Network is based on a broadcast model. That is, it speaks the same message to multiple publics. There\u0027s not a lot of targeting to regional-specific audiences or narrow demographic groups.",
        "The strategy that Bush adapted in that campaign is what he called \"Story of the Day.\" \"Story of the Day\" is you pick a topic that you want to hit your opponent on especially, and you find ways to dramatize that topic through images, through your personal appearances, through the other people who are tied to the campaign who are giving talking points. And you want one unified message which carries the day.",
        "Classic example is Bush goes to Boston Harbor to attack to Dukakis on his environmental record. All three major news networks gave that top coverage that evening. And what you find is that news cameras use the same soundbites by Bush, they use the same images, the cameras actually do Bush\u0027s dirty work by focusing directly on the sewage waste in the Boston Harbor and dramatizing his issues. And Dukakis\u0027 response is simply him talking to the camera. So that\u0027s the politics of the network era.",
        "Four years pass, and the way America watches television changes fairly drastically over that period of time. More and more people are getting their news and information from cable. There\u0027s a wider array of options. And cable is embracing this narrowcasting notion of specific appeals to specific demographic groups, of targeted messages, of a focused public. And Clinton recognizes that there are all kinds of opportunities in cable that were not there in the network broadcast paradigm.",
        "So Clinton uses cable to completely blindside Bush. He goes on MTV. He goes on Arsenio Hall. He goes on Larry King. He goes on Nashville Network. He\u0027s courting a number of different publics with different messages that are tailored very intensely to the interest of that particular group. What appears on network TV is simply an image of that appearance-- Clinton answering questions about his underwear on MTV or Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall, often images that trivialize those appearances. But for the constituencies that Clinton is speaking to, such as the MTV audience, he\u0027s given an enormous amount of space to frame his issues and his terms to that specific voting block.",
        "So what we get is a diffused message from Clinton during that campaign, which motivates voters. So the largest voter participation of 18- to 27-year-olds of any election in recent memory-- since the 18-year-olds got the right to vote, in fact-- motivated by Clinton\u0027s appearance on MTV. And Rock the Vote was really pivotal in bringing out that election.",
        "Well, Clinton, I think, learned a brutalizing message, which is that you run on cable right now but you have to govern on network TV. That is, all those diffused messages to multiple publics, which developed intense voter participation four years ago, became scattershot, confused, decentered unfocused when he tried to govern because he was still being evaluated on those three major networks on the evening news. And in that space, Clinton\u0027s administration seemed completely incompetent. So Clinton had to retool himself for the evening news.",
        "The same message was learned by Newt Gingrich, who is also a product of cable television. And I like to call Gingrich and Clinton the \"not ready for prime time players\" because they were, in fact, such products of cable that they weren\u0027t ready for prime time network news. Gingrich\u0027s career begins on C-SPAN. And what Gingrich did as a young representative from a small district in Georgia was realize there was a slot in the day in the early evening hours which historically had been used by representatives to stand up in an empty house and deliver messages which went directly to Congressional Record and were sent out to constituents back home.",
        "Gingrich recognized that that was free air time on C-SPAN every evening in the dinner hour. He went on every night at the same time, the same focused speech on every issue of the day, and said flamboyant things that had a very intense appeal to conservative Americans. He graduated from that to The Family Network and to GOP TV, which are even more focused on the conservative constituencies. And he was able to spring from free air time on C-SPAN to a national political constituency.",
        "The minute he reaches power, though, he\u0027s also being judged by the evening news where those red meat issues that he focused, that got attention on C-SPAN, suddenly seem too intense or too conservative or too reactionary and extreme for middle America. And so he also failed to be able to govern on network television. So we\u0027re seeing is that politicians are being pulled back and forth between the network paradigm of a general message to a general audience and the cable space which opens up a lot of chances for challengers to emerge and to begin to exploit the medium to get messages out and motivate very intensely committed groups of voters.",
        "I think Clinton still uses it, but I don\u0027t think either of them are using it as effectively as Clinton did four years ago. I think they are frightened by it. Dole is fairly inept at every medium I can think of. There\u0027s not a single medium one could say Bob Dole uses well. We\u0027ve seen him completely misunderstand the nature of this cable politics in the last debate, where he\u0027s used to talking on network news, where he talks over the interviewer and delivers his message no matter what.",
        "That very first question in the debate when the school teacher asked him about children\u0027s innocence and their hopes for the future, and he used it in cynically as a platform to attack Bill Clinton on his ethics issue. One saw an example where he didn\u0027t understand the embodiment of those issues in specific people and specific constituencies and how it matters who you\u0027re speaking to and where you\u0027re speaking in cable.",
        "But those are moments that are probably the most memorable moments in the campaign. They are moments they were replayed over and over on those networks. They are moments that I think shaped public perceptions of these candidates in a significant way. And I think our understanding of Clinton was defined more through those moments than through the evening news. So their impact is much greater than the sheer number of events."

        "October 1. The Dole campaign treats me so oddly when I arrive this morning for the trip to Cleveland that I find myself looking back over my shoulder to see if there\u0027s some other Michael they\u0027re talking to. That I have a name is itself unusual. Normally, I\u0027m just checked off the cargo list as The New Republic i.e., another magazine writer who, together with his readership, can safely be ignored. But this morning, I am carrying my new Sony Digital Super SteadyShot Handycam DCR-VX1000 millimeter, a palmable grey box that crack technicians from ABC spent nearly an hour teaching me to use. It is festooned with various stickers that say ABC News.",
        "Yesterday, I mentioned in passing to a Dole staffer that I might do some shooting for Nightline tomorrow, as if I were the sort of person who did shooting for Nightline all the time. Now, a Dole campaign worker named Charlie is standing over me like an old friend. \"Hi, Michael,\" he says. \"Good to see you again. You know, you\u0027re not allowed to film on the plane.\"",
        "When I step onto the plane, a second Dole staffer tells me the same thing. As I take my seat across the coffee table from a radio lady, a third Dole worker stops by and stresses the point. Apparently, the place where the campaign television journalist spends the vast majority of his time is considered outside the bounds of television journalism.",
        "Before all these warnings, it had never occurred to me to film on the Dole plane. Now it does. Just before takeoff, I stand up and take my first shot. A fat cameraman on his way to the toilet squeezes past a skinny stewardess, and I have him in my crosshairs. \"You\u0027re not supposed to do that!\" a voice shrieks out at me. It\u0027s the radio lady playing narc. Charlie appears beside my seat to remind me of \"the rule.\" He does a nice job of not being upset.",
        "The day unfolds uneventfully-- Dole gives a speech in a gym-- except for my peculiar new relationship with the Dole campaign staff. Normally, I have to set off a flare to get their attention. Today, Charlie takes the seat beside me on the bus and for the rest of the day never seems to be very far away. Whatever they think I might do, I don\u0027t. By the time the rally starts, I have busted the sound mechanism, lost the earplugs, and run out of batteries. I put the camera to one side. Charlie vanishes.",
        "But then we head back to the plane and a fresh battery, which brings us to the episode of the shrimp.",
        "Once we\u0027d settled into our seats, I set about trying to fix all the parts of the camera I\u0027d busted. In order not to offend the Dole people, I decide to test the thing on what I figure is a declassified object-- a large plate of cold, mottled shrimp that has been laid on the table between me and a pair of radio reporters.",
        "I hunker right over the little buggers so that the ABC technicians will see I have absorbed what they\u0027ve taught me about not giving in to the temptation of zoom. But the moment I\u0027m in place, the radio woman shrieks out to the Dole staff and makes to cover the shrimp with a sheet of paper. \"It\u0027s OK,\" I say gently. \"I\u0027m just seeing if this thing still works.\" I keep shooting for a good five seconds. Then I put the camera away.",
        "Suddenly, a Dole lady is in my face, teeth gritted, breath blowing. \"We told you seven times not to film on the plane,\" she shouts. \"You don\u0027t know how serious this is.\"",
        "\"But it was just the shrimp,\" I begin to say before she cuts me off. \"We told you.\" I want to protest that it\u0027s not my fault her guy is 20 points down the polls, and she\u0027s on the fast track to not being the next Dee Dee Myers. It\u0027s not worth the trouble.",
        "I return to the New York Times where Dole\u0027s campaign manager, Scott Reed, is quoted as saying that some major event is about to transform public opinion. \"We deserve a break, and we\u0027re going to have one,\" he explains. Asked to be more specific, he said, \"Something. World affairs.\" It\u0027s hard to see how the shrimp fit into this scenario.",
        "October 6. On the streets outside the debate hall in Hartford, the Super SteadyShot wreaks havoc. Many hundreds of previously listless protesters leap into action at the sight of it. \"Let\u0027s have some action for ABC,\" I shout. And the effect is distinctly more dramatic than if I\u0027d said, \"Let\u0027s have some action for The New Republic.\"",
        "They rise as one and proclaim their causes. One moment, they are an undifferentiated jumble of people shivering in the cold. The next, they are the ardent supporters of Nader and Perot, pro-life and anti-vivisection, anti-deficit and pro-welfare. Of course, the SteadyShot is not permitted inside the Bushnell Theatre. It is too powerful a weapon to be permitted close to the candidates.",
        "So after a brief altercation with a security guard, I retire to Spin Alley. Spin Alley is what the debate organizers have renamed the Hartford Civic Center until a few journalists start pointing out that only a few years ago, political hacks actually denied that they \"spun\" at all. The signs saying Spin Alley are then ripped down, which, when you think about it, is itself a form of spin.",
        "At any rate, the Super SteadyShot penetrates Spin Alley, emanating its extraordinary forcefield. When she enters the frame, the comely Maureen Dowd dives behind her notepad, and who can blame her? Once you\u0027re in the camera\u0027s eye, you no longer have control of your soul. Truly, it is astonishing the way all of the important people cave in to the camera.",
        "I point it at White House Spokesman Mike McCurry, then at Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, then at Labor Secretary Robert Reich. They answer questions that they might ignore if it were just me and mine eye. How do you feel as you stand there spinning me? If you truly felt that your candidate had lost, would you say as much?",
        "They are not talking to me, of course, but to some notional audience-- the American people. And whatever they might be thinking, they treat the camera with deference. In the same way that ordinary people feel obliged to smile when they have their picture taken-- even when they are unhappy-- important people feel pressure to answer sincerely even when they are insincere.",
        "I miss the debate entirely. I\u0027m too busy taking pictures of people assessing the debate, which they do from the moment it starts. No matter. I\u0027m able to track its effect between the lines of Scott Reed\u0027s quotes. Tomorrow in the New York Times, Reed will revise his mental picture of the campaign. \"This is going to be a steady building process for the next 30 days,\" he will say. \"There\u0027s not going to be an overnight shift.\" All of a sudden, it\u0027s looking as if every little shrimp might matter."

Apparently, the place where the campaign television journalist spends the vast majority of his time is considered outside the bounds of television journalism.",
        "Before all these warnings, it had never occurred to me to film on the Dole plane. Now it does. Just before takeoff, I stand up and take my first shot. A fat cameraman on his way to the toilet squeezes past a skinny stewardess, and I have him in my crosshairs. \"You\u0027re not supposed to do that!\" a voice shrieks out at me. It\u0027s the radio lady playing narc. Charlie appears beside my seat to remind me of \"the rule.\" He does a nice job of not being upset.",
        "I point it at White House Spokesman Mike McCurry, then at Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, then at Labor Secretary Robert Reich. They answer questions that they might ignore if it were just me and mine eye. How do you feel as you stand there spinning me? If you truly felt that your candidate had lost, would you say as much?",
        "The day unfolds uneventfully-- Dole gives a speech in a gym-- except for my peculiar new relationship with the Dole campaign staff. Normally, I have to set off a flare to get their attention. Today, Charlie takes the seat beside me on the bus and for the rest of the day never seems to be very far away. Whatever they think I might do, I don\u0027t. By the time the rally starts, I have busted the sound mechanism, lost the earplugs, and run out of batteries. I put the camera to one side. Charlie vanishes.",
        "But then we head back to the plane and a fresh battery, which brings us to the episode of the shrimp.",
        "They rise as one and proclaim their causes. One moment, they are an undifferentiated jumble of people shivering in the cold. The next, they are the ardent supporters of Nader and Perot, pro-life and anti-vivisection, anti-deficit and pro-welfare. Of course, the SteadyShot is not permitted inside the Bushnell Theatre. It is too powerful a weapon to be permitted close to the candidates.",
        "\"But it was just the shrimp,\" I begin to say before she cuts me off. \"We told you.\" I want to protest that it\u0027s not my fault her guy is 20 points down the polls, and she\u0027s on the fast track to not being the next Dee Dee Myers. It\u0027s not worth the trouble."

            "I think what we\u0027re dealing with is a kind of crucial transitional moment in American politics. And it\u0027s actually change that\u0027s occurred over the last couple of elections from an era where network television dominated the political campaign toward a point where cable television is dominating the campaign and looking toward a point when cyberspace or the online communities will dominate. Each of those medium have different properties which candidates have to respond to and shape their campaigns around.",
            "So if we go back eight years to Bush versus Dukakis, Bush was a paramount politician of an era of network television. Network is based on a broadcast model. That is, it speaks the same message to multiple publics. There\u0027s not a lot of targeting to regional-specific audiences or narrow demographic groups.",
            "The strategy that Bush adapted in that campaign is what he called \"Story of the Day.\" \"Story of the Day\" is you pick a topic that you want to hit your opponent on especially, and you find ways to dramatize that topic through images, through your personal appearances, through the other people who are tied to the campaign who are giving talking points. And you want one unified message which carries the day.",
            "Classic example is Bush goes to Boston Harbor to attack to Dukakis on his environmental record. All three major news networks gave that top coverage that evening. And what you find is that news cameras use the same soundbites by Bush, they use the same images, the cameras actually do Bush\u0027s dirty work by focusing directly on the sewage waste in the Boston Harbor and dramatizing his issues. And Dukakis\u0027 response is simply him talking to the camera. So that\u0027s the politics of the network era.",
            "Four years pass, and the way America watches television changes fairly drastically over that period of time. More and more people are getting their news and information from cable. There\u0027s a wider array of options. And cable is embracing this narrowcasting notion of specific appeals to specific demographic groups, of targeted messages, of a focused public. And Clinton recognizes that there are all kinds of opportunities in cable that were not there in the network broadcast paradigm.",
            "So Clinton uses cable to completely blindside Bush. He goes on MTV. He goes on Arsenio Hall. He goes on Larry King. He goes on Nashville Network. He\u0027s courting a number of different publics with different messages that are tailored very intensely to the interest of that particular group. What appears on network TV is simply an image of that appearance-- Clinton answering questions about his underwear on MTV or Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall, often images that trivialize those appearances. But for the constituencies that Clinton is speaking to, such as the MTV audience, he\u0027s given an enormous amount of space to frame his issues and his terms to that specific voting block.",
            "So what we get is a diffused message from Clinton during that campaign, which motivates voters. So the largest voter participation of 18- to 27-year-olds of any election in recent memory-- since the 18-year-olds got the right to vote, in fact-- motivated by Clinton\u0027s appearance on MTV. And Rock the Vote was really pivotal in bringing out that election.",
            "Well, Clinton, I think, learned a brutalizing message, which is that you run on cable right now but you have to govern on network TV. That is, all those diffused messages to multiple publics, which developed intense voter participation four years ago, became scattershot, confused, decentered unfocused when he tried to govern because he was still being evaluated on those three major networks on the evening news. And in that space, Clinton\u0027s administration seemed completely incompetent. So Clinton had to retool himself for the evening news.",
            "The same message was learned by Newt Gingrich, who is also a product of cable television. And I like to call Gingrich and Clinton the \"not ready for prime time players\" because they were, in fact, such products of cable that they weren\u0027t ready for prime time network news. Gingrich\u0027s career begins on C-SPAN. And what Gingrich did as a young representative from a small district in Georgia was realize there was a slot in the day in the early evening hours which historically had been used by representatives to stand up in an empty house and deliver messages which went directly to Congressional Record and were sent out to constituents back home.",
            "Gingrich recognized that that was free air time on C-SPAN every evening in the dinner hour. He went on every night at the same time, the same focused speech on every issue of the day, and said flamboyant things that had a very intense appeal to conservative Americans. He graduated from that to The Family Network and to GOP TV, which are even more focused on the conservative constituencies. And he was able to spring from free air time on C-SPAN to a national political constituency.",
            "The minute he reaches power, though, he\u0027s also being judged by the evening news where those red meat issues that he focused, that got attention on C-SPAN, suddenly seem too intense or too conservative or too reactionary and extreme for middle America. And so he also failed to be able to govern on network television. So we\u0027re seeing is that politicians are being pulled back and forth between the network paradigm of a general message to a general audience and the cable space which opens up a lot of chances for challengers to emerge and to begin to exploit the medium to get messages out and motivate very intensely committed groups of voters.",
            "I think Clinton still uses it, but I don\u0027t think either of them are using it as effectively as Clinton did four years ago. I think they are frightened by it. Dole is fairly inept at every medium I can think of. There\u0027s not a single medium one could say Bob Dole uses well. We\u0027ve seen him completely misunderstand the nature of this cable politics in the last debate, where he\u0027s used to talking on network news, where he talks over the interviewer and delivers his message no matter what.",
            "That very first question in the debate when the school teacher asked him about children\u0027s innocence and their hopes for the future, and he used it in cynically as a platform to attack Bill Clinton on his ethics issue. One saw an example where he didn\u0027t understand the embodiment of those issues in specific people and specific constituencies and how it matters who you\u0027re speaking to and where you\u0027re speaking in cable.",
            "But those are moments that are probably the most memorable moments in the campaign. They are moments they were replayed over and over on those networks. They are moments that I think shaped public perceptions of these candidates in a significant way. And I think our understanding of Clinton was defined more through those moments than through the evening news. So their impact is much greater than the sheer number of events."

And Clinton recognizes that there are all kinds of opportunities in cable that were not there in the network broadcast paradigm.",
            "I think what we\u0027re dealing with is a kind of crucial transitional moment in American politics. And it\u0027s actually change that\u0027s occurred over the last couple of elections from an era where network television dominated the political campaign toward a point where cable television is dominating the campaign and looking toward a point when cyberspace or the online communities will dominate. Each of those medium have different properties which candidates have to respond to and shape their campaigns around.",
            "So if we go back eight years to Bush versus Dukakis, Bush was a paramount politician of an era of network television. Network is based on a broadcast model. That is, it speaks the same message to multiple publics. There\u0027s not a lot of targeting to regional-specific audiences or narrow demographic groups.",
            "Classic example is Bush goes to Boston Harbor to attack to Dukakis on his environmental record. All three major news networks gave that top coverage that evening. And what you find is that news cameras use the same soundbites by Bush, they use the same images, the cameras actually do Bush\u0027s dirty work by focusing directly on the sewage waste in the Boston Harbor and dramatizing his issues. And Dukakis\u0027 response is simply him talking to the camera. So that\u0027s the politics of the network era.",
            "The strategy that Bush adapted in that campaign is what he called \"Story of the Day.\" \"Story of the Day\" is you pick a topic that you want to hit your opponent on especially, and you find ways to dramatize that topic through images, through your personal appearances, through the other people who are tied to the campaign who are giving talking points. And you want one unified message which carries the day.",

That I have a name is itself unusual. Normally, I\u0027m just checked off the cargo list as The New Republic i.e., another magazine writer who, together with his readership, can safely be ignored. But this morning, I am carrying my new Sony Digital Super SteadyShot Handycam DCR-VX1000 millimeter, a palmable grey box that crack technicians from ABC spent nearly an hour teaching me to use. It is festooned with various stickers that say ABC News.",

Now, a Dole campaign worker named Charlie is standing over me like an old friend. \"Hi, Michael,\" he says. \"Good to see you again. You know, you\u0027re not allowed to film on the plane.\"",

As I take my seat across the coffee table from a radio lady, a third Dole worker stops by and stresses the point.

            "Before all these warnings, it had never occurred to me to film on the Dole plane. Now it does. Just before takeoff, I stand up and take my first shot. A fat cameraman on his way to the toilet squeezes past a skinny stewardess, and I have him in my crosshairs. \"You\u0027re not supposed to do that!\" a voice shrieks out at me. It\u0027s the radio lady playing narc. Charlie appears beside my seat to remind me of \"the rule.\" He does a nice job of not being upset.",

            "\"But it was just the shrimp,\" I begin to say before she cuts me off. \"We told you.\" I want to protest that it\u0027s not my fault her guy is 20 points down the polls, and she\u0027s on the fast track to not being the next Dee Dee Myers. It\u0027s not worth the trouble.",

Gingrich\u0027s career begins on C-SPAN. And what Gingrich did as a young representative from a small district in Georgia was realize there was a slot in the day in the early evening hours which historically had been used by representatives to stand up in an empty house and deliver messages which went directly to Congressional Record and were sent out to constituents back home."

So we\u0027re seeing is that politicians are being pulled back and forth between the network paradigm of a general message to a general audience and the cable space which opens up a lot of chances for challengers to emerge and to begin to exploit the medium to get messages out and motivate very intensely committed groups of voters."

            "April 19. I leave my hotel earlier than I need to and walk down from the Washington Monument to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Even at 7:30 in the morning, the Mall is nearly deserted, the Lincoln Memorial empty. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the other hand, is teeming with people who appear to have been up for hours, walking slowly along the length of the black marble slab bearing the names of the dead. For the next 20 minutes, I sit on a bench dodging bird droppings and waiting for Senator John McCain, who has agreed to meet me here.",
            "In my attempts to spot him at a distance, I can\u0027t help but notice how differently ordinary people behave from politicians. Maybe 50 likely candidates pass through my line of vision, and not one of them could pass for a US senator at 100 paces. They comb their hair in public, scratch themselves, hold hands.",
            "At 8:00 on the button, McCain appears at my side, looking very senatorial except for a pair of outrageously wide black aviator sunglasses with some undignified name-- Hobby? Hippo?-- stenciled on the earpiece. McCain is the Dole surrogate most in demand as a speaker around the country. And it\u0027s not hard to see why. What matters most to the people who wish to see McCain speak for Dole is the formative experience that the two senators ostensibly share. Both nearly died in a war. Both endured indescribable pain and suffering.",
            "Dole\u0027s ordeal is at the center of his national campaign. To some extent, it is his campaign. McCain\u0027s trials are less known. On October 26, 1967, when he ejected out of his Navy jet and into a North Vietnamese mob, McCain suffered two broken arms, a shattered knee and shoulder, and bayonet wounds in his ankle and groin.",
            "Robert Timberg\u0027s gripping book, The Nightingale\u0027s Song, depicts McCain two months later in his first prison cell. McCain weighed less than 100 pounds. His hair, flecked with gray since high school, was nearly snow white. Clots of food clung to his face, neck, hair and beard. His cheeks were sunken, his neck chicken-like, his legs atrophying.",
            "McCain survived in captivity without medical treatment for the next five years, enduring torture so exquisite that even to read about it causes sweat to pop out on your brow. His captors would hang him by his broken arms from dangling ropes for hours on end, for instance. But the astonishing part of McCain\u0027s experience was its voluntary aspect.",
            "McCain is the third generation of a distinguished military family. His father was an admiral during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese hoped that this famous prisoner of war would violate US military policy, which dictated that prisoners be returned in the order they arrived. If he accepted their offer of freedom, McCain would testify to the demoralization of the American troops. For five and a half years, his captors tried to torture him into going home. For five and a half years, he refused to go.",
            "We walk alongside the black granite slab against the oncoming traffic, then back again. The Park Service says that the memorial has become the second most frequently visited site in Washington after the Capitol. McCain admits that at first, he found it depressing and even faintly antagonistic. But one day, he was passing through on his own-- he visits often by himself-- and discovered a couple of veterans running their hands across the inscribed names. Clearly, the two men had never met before, but they had fallen into conversation, swapped war stories, and in a few minutes were clutching each other and weeping. If that kind of healing goes on, says McCain, well, then it\u0027s a good thing.",
            "Someone once said that an explanation is where the mind comes to rest. There is a feeling about McCain-- one that seems lacking in Dole-- that he has somehow explained his own experience to himself. He has assimilated his trauma differently than the candidate he\u0027s behind. He says, \"This is the McCain theory, and I think it\u0027s valid. I was an adult when I was shot down. 31 years old. I\u0027d had a whole life. He was 19. What were you like when you were 19? I believe that everything Bob Dole has done since the war was dictated by that experience.\"",
            "The Vietnam veteran has achieved a kind of equanimity that is supposed to be reserved only for veterans of good wars. When Clinton arrived at the White House, for instance, McCain sent him a note saying that any time the president wished to walk down to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the senator from Arizona would be glad to walk alongside him. Clinton sent back a nice note. Recalling this exchange causes McCain to break his rhythm. We were walking back towards the bench, and McCain is limping slightly, like a high school football star. Hi is remembering something else.",
            "\"I don\u0027t know if you want to write about this,\" he begins. \"Back in the mid-\u002780s, a guy who protested the war came into my office. He said his name was David Ifshin.\"",
            "In December 1970, David Ifshin had led a group of American students to Hanoi, where he delivered an antiwar radio address to American soldiers engaged in attacks on North Vietnam. Like other anti-American propaganda, his program was piped into McCain\u0027s prison cell from 6:00 in the morning until 9:00 at night. But McCain, who can generate anger in a heartbeat, shows not the faintest trace of resentment. He explains, \"Ifshin stood in my office and he says, \u0027I came here to tell you I made a mistake. I was wrong, and I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 And I said to him, \u0027Look, I accept your apology. We\u0027ll be friends. But more importantly, I want you to forget it. Go on with your life. You cannot look back.\u0027\"",
            "Here he pauses, and I figure he\u0027s finished. But he\u0027s groping behind his aviator sunglasses for the point of his anecdote, that forgiveness is ultimately less self-destructive than the bitter desire for revenge. Or perhaps that there is no such thing as revenge. Five months ago, David Ifshin was diagnosed with cancer. The cancer has proved untreatable and has spread rapidly. David Ifshin is now dying. He\u0027s 47 years old and has a wife and three young children. Says McCain, \"When I heard about it, it did pass through my mind. Suppose I had told David Ifshin to get the hell out of my office. How would I feel about myself now?\"",
            "April 23. I\u0027m walking out the door of my Washington apartment on my way to find David Ifshin when John McCain calls. I\u0027ve made the mistake of telling his press secretary what I\u0027m up to, and she\u0027s passed it along to the senator, who is seriously concerned. He says, \"Look, I don\u0027t mean to insult you, but be careful with this. If you wrote anything that hurt David or Gail or the kids, I\u0027d never forgive myself. I\u0027d forgive you, but I wouldn\u0027t forgive myself.\"",
            "It\u0027s a half-hour drive out of Washington to the Ifshin\u0027s house in the Maryland suburbs, where I find a gaunt, bearded man stretched out on a patio lounge chair, attended by his wife, Gail. This afternoon he\u0027s tired, and his voice is barely audible as he sketches his political career. The cover of Life magazine of April 23, 1971 shows David Ifshin, age 22, at a war rally, wearing a collegiate goatee. He\u0027s standing directly behind Jane Fonda, who has her fist raised. After his war protests, he worked on a kibbutz.",
            "But when he returned to America, he also returned to national politics. He went on to work on the Mondale campaign and, to a storm of protest, was even tapped to head the Dukakis transition team. He spent 10 years as general counsel to AIPAC, the Israeli lobby. He had met Clinton briefly in 1972. 20 years later, when Clinton ran for president, Ifshin became general counsel for his campaign. Before he accepted the job, however, he told Clinton he\u0027d been attacked for his war record each time he\u0027d joined a presidential campaign.",

Ifshin spotted Senator John McCain at a distance and decided that he was the man who deserved the apology. Ifshin says, \"I hoisted up my courage and went over to him. And before I could get a word out, McCain says, \u0027I owe you an apology.\u0027\"",
            "A couple of years earlier, during the 1984 presidential campaign, McCain had given a speech in which he attacked Ifshin\u0027s war record. \"Basically, someone had handed him a script,\" says Ifshin, \"and he read it.

It was blind fate, I told him at that time. I said, \u0027I owed you an apology, and you robbed me of the chance to make it.\u0027 And he was characteristically modest and humble about it.\" Later that year, McCain and Ifshin, together with a Vietnamese emigre named Doan Van Toai, established the Institute for Democracy in Vietnam.",
            "Ifshin shifts painfully in his chair and stops to catch his breath. It was at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that what he calls \"the second half of the story\" with McCain began.

It began by praising Clinton\u0027s Memorial Day address on behalf of Vietnam\u0027s veterans.

            "In December 1970, David Ifshin had led a group of American students to Hanoi, where he delivered an antiwar radio address to American soldiers engaged in attacks on North Vietnam.

After his war protests, he worked on a kibbutz.",

His captors would hang him by his broken arms from dangling ropes for hours on end, for instance. But the astonishing part of McCain\u0027s experience was its voluntary aspect.",

Clearly, the two men had never met before, but they had fallen into conversation, swapped war stories, and in a few minutes were clutching each other and weeping.

I\u0027ve made the mistake of telling his press secretary what I\u0027m up to, and she\u0027s passed it along to the senator, who is seriously concerned. He says, \"Look, I don\u0027t mean to insult you, but be careful with this. If you wrote anything that hurt David or Gail or the kids, I\u0027d never forgive myself. I\u0027d forgive you, but I wouldn\u0027t forgive myself.\"",

He\u0027s 47 years old and has a wife and three young children. Says McCain, \"When I heard about it, it did pass through my mind. Suppose I had told David Ifshin to get the hell out of my office.

Gingrich\u0027s career begins on C-SPAN. And what Gingrich did as a young representative from a small district in Georgia was realize there was a slot in the day in the early evening hours which historically had been used by representatives to stand up in an empty house and deliver messages which went directly to Congressional Record and were sent out to constituents back home."

So we\u0027re seeing is that politicians are being pulled back and forth between the network paradigm of a general message to a general audience and the cable space which opens up a lot of chances for challengers to emerge and to begin to exploit the medium to get messages out and motivate very intensely committed groups of voters."
