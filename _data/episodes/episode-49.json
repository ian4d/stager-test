In this first picture, we have a caterpillar eating a tomato-- a brightly-colored close-up of that. The second picture, a praying mantis eats the caterpillar. And in the third picture, a tarantula eats the praying mantis.

And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system.

But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo one would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and photo two would just show a well-fed frog."

Finally, in one session, at 3:00 in the morning, after staring at her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the light box."

And then you see his head, and its antennas are waving around, and slowly, the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive."

Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves like ours does-- on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside, so when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them."

And the male was nowhere to be found. But then, one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him like she was holding him round the neck, like locking arm-in-arm, and she started eating him.

You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning.

But as far as being clumsy-- Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally. That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do."

But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it\u0027s a whole different ball game. He\u0027ll come with me and run for a while, but then he walks and lags behind. And sometimes, he just goes home. So if I\u0027m an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?"

The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off of their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating. And then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin because we don\u0027t have a fur coat. So we can\u0027t run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat."

        "It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. Praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the spider-- tarantula-- to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators--",
        "That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great is she springs on it and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out.",
        "So if they\u0027re eating leaves, when she bites into it-- and this was totally a surprise when this first happened-- it comes out green or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow if you\u0027re feeding then yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different-colored guts coming out.",
        "And it was just beautiful. I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than certainly the human world, it was very beautiful.",
        "You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then, basically, the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside down looking straight at you. And perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of his body. And then you see his head, and its antennas are waving around, and slowly, the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive.",
        "And then, the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it. And it took, maybe, three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long.",
        "I got attached to the praying mantises. Seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves like ours does-- on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside, so when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them.",
        "So that\u0027s the female, that\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. Look like a nice, happy couple. He has green eyes, she has brown.",
        "He\u0027s on top of her, and it\u0027s just like classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours-- hours and hours and hours. I\u0027ll take a few pictures, I\u0027ll come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes.",
        "So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning. And the male was nowhere to be found. But then, one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him like she was holding him round the neck, like locking arm-in-arm, and she started eating him. Couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that.",
        "You see, he\u0027s still halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there.",
        "Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See? He\u0027s already past his waist. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those.",
        "When does he die?",
        "Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, which is why-- or whatever they call it in bug stuff.",
        "And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity, and when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor. And when that\u0027s gone, she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized.",
        "He\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive when she\u0027s only eaten his face off.",
        "And the world changed, because instead of just seeing patterns of swarming flies, I saw leg hairs and genitals and mouths. I saw them, I saw their lives, how they would kind of greet each other and what they would do. And I could see them being born, I could see them having sex, I could see them eating, I could see them flying, I could see them hanging out. And it was great. It was fascinating. So I\u0027d sit there for hours, or until they went to the bathroom on the glass enough I couldn\u0027t see anymore. And that\u0027s when I kind of got hooked into animals past a certain point of return.",
        "No, it takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there.",
        "No, I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there.",
        "She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess.",
        "I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly.",
        "The two of them hanging out together, yeah. Their faces are about the same size-- well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse.",
        "Hard to tell what makes something that small that happy.",
        "Hmm. Very strange.",
        "Hasn\u0027t happened like this before.",
        "When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten-- to photograph them specifically to be eaten-- was repugnant. It made me kind of sick. The more I\u0027ve thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was.",
        "No, and it has never squealed before.",
        "Pinkie was bigger, older.",
        "You look at the tail, you can usually tell. See, when the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it out.",
        "No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up.",
        "Yeah, your sides change. At one point, you feel really bad about the pinkie, and at one point, you\u0027re really happy your snake ate, and therefore it\u0027s really and it\u0027s going to live. In something like this, your sides always change. And when you put the pinkie up there before you put the snake up there, you feel really bad. You think, \"Oh, well, this little thing doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s about to be eaten.\"",
        "And with The Food Chain project, that was one of the points is that you take the side of the underdog. And then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. I mean, it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyway. So you just kind of get all confused, really.",
        "It\u0027s one thing to feed-- I was telling you this before-- to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet, or it can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse, who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably.",
        "No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue.",
        "Well, you never really like something to suffer. I definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyway.",
        "It\u0027s no different to the snake. The snake doesn\u0027t really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But it\u0027s dying anyway. It dies a little faster or it dies a little slower, possibly. I cared more. The snake didn\u0027t care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go by mine?",
        "So this is basically the food chain."

        "They didn\u0027t even give me a chance. I was able to follow them for about 30 minutes, but the problem was I wasn\u0027t sure if I was following the same ones I started following, because I started out following four-- a buck, two does, and a younger one. And after about 10 minutes, they ran into a group of about five more antelope, went over a hill, and then on the other side of the hill, they broke into two groups again.",
        "So I think I ended up following the same four, but I couldn\u0027t be sure. And I followed them for another 15 minutes, and then they ran into a much larger group, ran for a ways, and then followed that larger group for a while, And then that group broke into at least two more groups. And at that point, I just sort of gave up and quit following them because I didn\u0027t know which individuals I was chasing. And then I got confused on the roads. Where\u0027s the road we were on? Down here?",
        "OK, what happened was I came out on this road, way over there somewhere. And I got lost. I didn\u0027t know really where I was. I felt like that road-- I was walking along that road for about 15 minutes. I felt like that was the wrong direction. So we started over there.",
        "Well, they ran in a circle, then. Because we went off-- I don\u0027t remember crossing this road, but I must\u0027ve originally, early on.",

        "If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers-- her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing-- it becomes clear to me as she shows me her work that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar.",
        "You\u0027d think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That\u0027s what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo one would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and photo two would just show a well-fed frog.",
        "Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She\u0027d put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally, in one session, at 3:00 in the morning, after staring at her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the light box.",
        "At this point in The Food Chain, her pictures were becoming more and more vivid, but so was the suffering that she was watching through her lens.",
        "Growing up, Catherine Chalmers wasn\u0027t really an animal person. She always had a pet or two, nothing unusual. But then a few years ago, she was working on these sculptures, where she would take dead insects and glue them onto plants and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flies. More than she could buy anywhere.",
        "One of the things that The Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which channels we love and which ones we hate-- the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us-- that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo.",
        "But she also finds herself drawn to the animals the we are supposed to fear and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from. At the light box, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex.",
        "So he\u0027s on top of her.",
        "Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick.",
        "The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color. But they\u0027re still pretty disturbing.",
        "And so she decided to start raising live flies in a glass cage in the corner of her apartment. She would just let them breed and wait for them to die. But then one day, she picked up a camera and looked at the flies through a close-up lens.",
        "What\u0027s that?",
        "And when does he die?",
        "Do you think he\u0027s dead there?",
        "What do you mean his head acts as an inhibitor?",
        "At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute. And the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators.",
        "Today, she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a \"pinkie\" because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie.",
        "She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all the pictures. It\u0027s chest high, about three feet by three feet with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus the third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm.",
        "Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?",
        "Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--",
        "The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it.",
        "It\u0027s very friendly.",
        "She realized that there were two basic moments of life that she couldn\u0027t see in the flies\u0027 cage. She couldn\u0027t see them eating, and she couldn\u0027t see them dying. So she came up with this project that she called The Food Chain. She decided to raise a few different animals-- caterpillars, praying mantises, frogs, spiders-- and take pictures of each animal eating the one that came beneath it in the natural food chain.",
        "It just looks that way, the two of them together.",
        "But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy.",
        "We stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move.",
        "What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually, when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death.",
        "This time, it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs alive for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it.",
        "Does the pinkie always struggle like that?",
        "What\u0027s the difference, do you think?",
        "Is it still alive now?",
        "I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?",
        "Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals, we\u0027re prohibited from killing, some, we\u0027re encouraged to kill, and most of them, we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing The Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals, and she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all.",
        "And do you ever feel like you\u0027re taking sides when you set up a photograph like this?",
        "So Catherine began to fill her loft with animals. There isn\u0027t much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it-- frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table; goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs; crickets, which chirp constantly; a tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a light box set up. And we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures.",
        "It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie. But she\u0027s growing. Eventually, she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day.",
        "Catherine talks about her apartment being like an oasis in the middle of SoHo. She loves coming home from the cars and concrete of Manhattan into a place that\u0027s filled with life. But in another way, it\u0027s Manhattan. It\u0027s our world that\u0027s the oasis in the middle of a planet that\u0027s full of nature. All around us, things are eating and having sex and dying and suffering. And we don\u0027t notice or even think about it.",
        "Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?",
        "So did you feel weird at all when he was squealing at the end? Did that make you feel strange at all?",
        "I guess there\u0027s a difference if it\u0027s being fed, if there\u0027s a purpose to it, if it\u0027s part of the chain.",
        "At the end of our photo shoot, Catherine carefully picks up the snake and carries it back to its cage. There\u0027s a bulge about a third of the way down the snake\u0027s body where the pinkie is being digested. Before I leave, Catherine pours us a glass of wine, and we sit on the floor for a little while playing with a couple of her full-grown mice, letting them run over our hands and up our arms. They\u0027re tiny and warm, and through their fur, we can feel their little hearts beating.",
        "[MUSIC - \"INSECT COLLECTOR\" BY SHONEN KNIFE]",
        "The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear, white background."

        "Yes, I\u0027m a worm, true. I live in the soil. Only in rain do I earthwards unfoil. On this day in question, we had a fierce shower. So using my well-known abdominal power, I lifted myself from the earth\u0027s muddy ground. I crawled and I climbed and eventually found myself on a window ledge-- me, just a worm, a fact I would now like to briefly confirm. My eyesight is faultless. I know what I\u0027d seen.",
        "The defendant herself, the spaniel Kathleen, engaged in destruction against the same sweater. She used it as a sort of appetite whetter. She gnawed at the fabric and tugged at the collar. And knowing no way I could stop her or stall her, I stood, a mute witness. I watched in disgust. I think it\u0027s appalling. I find it unjust. That dog\u0027s no puppy.",
        "She should\u0027ve known better than to lie on a mattress digesting a sweater. If you want my opinion, I think you ought to put her away. She\u0027s a heinous marauder.",

        "I can\u0027t read that far, not even in day. You might as well post it in Rome or Pompeii.",

        "I saw it, I did. The whole thing. And it reeks. I was sitting there calmly with nuts in my cheeks. I gather them daily. These nuts are my diet. An acorn, a pecan, you name it, I\u0027ll try it. Sometimes I\u0027ll hide them. I\u0027ll dig them a grave for some later time when we have a cold wave. It ain\u0027t easy digging through thick ice and snow.",
        "Yes, sir,",
        "Well, the rest of it goes, I was searching for food then, was out on my rounds. My sister remarked that I gained a few pounds in my hips and my shoulders. She thought it looked smashing. I respect her opinion, and so I was dashing to something I saw. It resembled a kernel of corn, so I thought. But it seems the infernal nugget in question turned out to be gum. It was chewed in a wad just the size of a crumb. I was out of my mind then. I wanted a snack.",
        "So anyway, right, if my memory serves, I was searching the ground for some type of hors d\u0027oeurve when I heard in the distance the sound of a voice. It sounded quite angry, so I made the choice. I peeked through the window and sat on my haunches, and then I became, for a brief while, unconscious.",
        "It happens, sometimes. I have these brief spells. I can\u0027t say for certain, but something compels my brain to relax, causing me to black out. I was hit in the head with a large brussels sprout last summer. I think it was early July. I think that\u0027s the reason. I\u0027m not certain why.",
        "Technically, yes,",
        "My body was there, but my mind was dreaming. I was there at the scene. That I know for a fact. I was hoping by speaking I might could extract some details, something I maybe could mention to justify all of this lavish attention. I find it exciting, dramatic, suspense. It all suits me perfect because, in a sense, I enjoy public speaking. I love center stage.",
        "I might have, you know, but I can\u0027t say for certain. I know what I told you, but now I\u0027m revertin\u0027. Is this microphone on? Hello? Do you mind if I sing?"

        "He patted his chest with potato-sized paws, then pounded his gavel and laid down the law.",
        "The clearing was silent. A cat took the floor, a smooth-talking tom with a high pompadour.",
        "It seemed like a lifetime. The worm took forever to inch to the stand and begin her endeavor.",
        "The worm had concluded. She\u0027d finished her say, and reached for a thimble of cold consomme.",
        "The cat said. I watched as a wren hopped to the floor where the cat once had been.",
        "The bird took a book written in Lebanese and carried it out past the pond to the trees.",
        "The angry worm hissed.",
        "Said the bird, keen on proving a point.",
        "She looked at the bird then, a certified goner. The wren whispered softly, as if to confirm, and then she lunged forward, beheading the worm.",
        "The cat yelled.",
        "The bird, in a grand show of physical fitness, finished the worm and returned to her perch, the lowest-hung branch of a young, silver birch.",
        "The cat called a witness, a chubby, black cricket I\u0027d seen once or twice in my room eat a ticket to movies or plays. This thing, it ate paper. Its body was small, just the size of a caper.",
        "Said the cricket, her vocal cords fierce in retort.",
        "Cried the bird. The cat yelled,",
        "The court was in chaos. The cricket hopped off. She flew through the air just like Baryshnikov. The bird then, she followed it into the thicket, and returned having eaten that hot-tempered cricket. There was no objection, no cry of foul play. The judge and the lawyers gave a silent OK.",
        "The judge barked.",
        "The bird said.",
        "The judge took an aspirin and shouted out--",
        "The cat took a watch from his pocket.",
        "There was no need to prompt her, no need to coerce the squirrel into talking. She set down her purse, and crossing her legs-- ladylike, at the shin-- the squirrel eyewitness began to weigh in.",
        "The cat cried.",
        "Said the squirrel.",
        "The cat lawyer cried.",
        "The bird said.",
        "The cat said.",
        "The squirrel said, beaming.",
        "I waited til late and crept out. It was dark. I was deep in the forest when I heard a bark. It was Kathleen, my spaniel, kneeling before an old dog-- a judge. And this elder, he wore a dark, floor-length robe. I think it was silk. He paused then and lapped from a bowl of skim milk.",
        "The bird then approached, feathers standing in rage.",
        "The bird slapped the stand with the tip of her wing and spat in disgust.",
        "She said. The cat flexed his paws, and then used them to shred that squirrel to ribbons. He tore it to bits and ate everything but her eyes and armpits. And then he pounced forward and firmly procured between his firm jaws that lawyering bird.",
        "That was all that I heard. The rest was too muffled. I watched for a while as the two of them scuffled. The cat took the bird right down to the beak. The judge rose, then asking if now he might speak.",
        "The judge then walked off and I watched as the cat foolishly followed that judge past a stump to a field of tires once used as a dump. I heard the cat hiss, then. I heard him yell, \"No.\" I can\u0027t say for certain who struck the first blow. But I can say who won. I know that the judge stepped out of his chambers unable to budge. He belched and he sagged, both lips heavy with fur, and looked out at the courtroom where others once were.",
        "He said to my spaniel.",
        "I heard Kathleen say.",
        "I waited for Kathleen beside a small creek. She passed me, despondent, refusing to speak. And me, I returned to my comfortable bed thinking of how, by some fluke, I\u0027d been led to animal court, that harsh, hostile scene, that by chance, thought to spare my companion, Kathleen."

        "Well, there were about eight down there.",
        "It just took off running. You want to follow it?",
        "We had good reasons for what we were doing. One was that it seemed entirely possible. Another had to do with an argument concerning human evolution. It\u0027s a scientific argument, so it takes a few minutes to explain. Remember the scene in 2001 when an ape-man realizes he can use a bone as a weapon and murders another ape-man? And he throws the bone in the air and it becomes a space station orbiting the earth.",
        "The theory behind this scene is that we separated from the apes when we stood upright and freed our hands to make and use tools, especially weapon-type tools for hunting and killing other animals. It\u0027s called the hunting hypothesis, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with it except that we don\u0027t have any physical evidence to support it. We just haven\u0027t found any tools or weapons that are that old.",
        "Well, some of the work that my brother does as a biologist made him interested in another theory of human evolution. You might call it the running hypothesis. He believed that he and I were probably good enough runners to be able to run down big game without using any weapons at all. And he thought that if we could do it, then maybe our early ancestors could have done it, too. Shortly before we went to Wyoming, I went to see Owen Lovejoy. He teaches anthropology at Kent State University. We talked about the running hypothesis, and he thought it was pretty funny.",
        "Mm hmm. Zebra.",
        "Yeah, I think that\u0027s the idea that they have.",
        "Well, I just happen to have a German Shepherd, and I take him with me when I go running.",

        "It could have been the Serengeti-- orange and green and purple plains, a hot sun, thin, high clouds, blue mountains on the horizon.",
        "It could\u0027ve been the Serengeti, but we were no primitive hunters. We quickly realized we knew nothing about the animal we were chasing or the land we were running on. We ran after several herds that first day without much success.",
        "That night, sleeping out, I remember feeling very high in terms of elevation, like being dizzy. There weren\u0027t any clouds in the sky, and it just seemed like too much open space. Satellites in orbit, the moon in orbit, and antelope in the bushes, chewing their cuds, and laughing amongst themselves.",
        "The next morning, we had a breakfast of chocolate chip cookies and orange juice and walked around waiting for the air to heat up.",
        "What?",
        "What is it?",
        "We found dead animals, bare bones, an abandoned house.",

            "Taming animals means basically teaching them to conform to the human world, teaching them human expectations. And with many of the animals that Samantha raises, it\u0027s possible to make them more human while they\u0027re little. But then, once they reach a certain age, their real animal nature kicks in. A baby cougar she was raising started stalking her friends, biting at their throats. The raccoons also go for the throat.",
            "What do we want from animals? To run her business, Samantha has had to figure this out. And at parties or corporate events, in commercials and films, Samantha has her raccoons pick pockets and play basketball. She has rats that bowl, rats that answer toy telephones.",
            "Do people want to see animals do animal things?",
            "Most of us, the only animals we ever see are animals who act like humans. You know, cats and dogs. We watch movies and TV shows and commercials that are filled with animals that fetch beers from the refrigerator and solve crimes. And we forget the sheer animal-ness of animals. We don\u0027t see it. Maybe we don\u0027t want to see it.",
            "Well, this brings us to the topic of today\u0027s program. From WBEZ, of course, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our program, The Animal-ness of Animals. Our show today in three acts.",
            "Act One, Staging the Food Chain in a New York Apartment. Act Two, Animal Court. That\u0027s an original radio play by David Sedaris. Act Three, The Moment Humans Stopped Being Animals That\u0027s a story by Scott Carrier. Stay with us.",
            "So when I heard that a woman named Samantha Martin had trained raccoons to play basketball and hires them out for parties and corporate events, I pictured raccoons in three-on-three or four-on-four games in little Chicago Bulls uniforms. Raccoon Scottie Pippen passes to raccoon Dennis Rodman. Raccoon Michael Jordan, you know, takes it in for a lay up or dunks it. The other team is a little raccoon Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers. I could see it all. But that is not what it was like. No, no, no. That was naive.",
            "Samantha Martin chases after one of her two basketball-playing raccoons, holding a bag of blue and pink cotton candy. She alternates, actually between taking a fingerful of cotton candy for herself and giving one to the raccoon.",
            "Samantha\u0027s actually a skilled and successful trainer, but the animals are not cooperating this day, probably because Samantha went away for the holidays and they\u0027re still feeling neglected. Samantha puts a grapefruit-sized ball in the raccoon\u0027s hand and then pushes the raccoon\u0027s hand toward a Fisher-Price basketball net that rises perhaps a foot and a half off the floor.",
            "The fact is, there are things that raccoons like to do, are born to do. Playing basketball is not one of them."

            "It starts with caterpillars that eat tomatoes. Praying mantises eat the caterpillars. And my original idea was for the spider-- tarantula-- to eat the praying mantises. But spiders are really undependable predators--",
            "That\u0027s the part that\u0027s really great is she springs on it and she wraps her arms around it. And she just starts biting into it. And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out.",
            "So if they\u0027re eating leaves, when she bites into it-- and this was totally a surprise when this first happened-- it comes out green or it comes out bright red, the color of the tomatoes, or it comes out bright yellow if you\u0027re feeding then yellow tomatoes. So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different-colored guts coming out.",
            "And it was just beautiful. I didn\u0027t know that an animal eating something live could be so attractive. It was like spilling a tube of paint out on a white piece of canvas. It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than certainly the human world, it was very beautiful.",
            "You see the shot where the two of them are looking at each other. And then, basically, the spider pounced on it and flipped it over. And the praying mantis is upside down looking straight at you. And perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of his body. And then you see his head, and its antennas are waving around, and slowly, the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive.",
            "And then, the spider basically mushes it up into a ball and extracts the juices out of it. And it took, maybe, three or four hours for it to eat the whole thing. And for at least half of that time, the praying mantis was perfectly alive. And it was hard, because you\u0027d spent so long raising this thing. It was really hard to see it being eaten alive like that and having it take so long.",
            "I got attached to the praying mantises. Seeing the praying mantises die was definitely much harder than seeing the caterpillars dying. Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves like ours does-- on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside, so when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them.",
            "So that\u0027s the female, that\u0027s the male. She\u0027s a lot bigger. Then they mated. Look like a nice, happy couple. He has green eyes, she has brown.",
            "He\u0027s on top of her, and it\u0027s just like classic doggy-style sex position. And they stay that way for hours-- hours and hours and hours. I\u0027ll take a few pictures, I\u0027ll come back in 20 minutes, take a few more pictures, come back in 20 minutes.",
            "So did I, especially insects. I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s somewhat rare. I was surprised. I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning. And the male was nowhere to be found. But then, one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him like she was holding him round the neck, like locking arm-in-arm, and she started eating him. Couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve mated them two years in a row now and hadn\u0027t had them do that.",
            "You see, he\u0027s still halfway on, and she reached around and grabbed him by the neck and bit his face off. See, he has no head there.",
            "Oh, that\u0027s one of his arms. There was kind of a fight. It\u0027s like the tip somewhere. And she\u0027s eating straight down his abdomen. See? He\u0027s already past his waist. She finished when she got there. She even ate some of the wings, munched on some of those.",
            "When does he die?",
            "Well, insects, it\u0027s like their bodies are more democratic. They don\u0027t have a central nervous system the same way we do. You bite their head off, and the whole theory is that their body keeps functioning. So she can bite his head off when they\u0027re in this position having sex, and he continues to have sex with her and continues to give her sperm, which is why-- or whatever they call it in bug stuff.",
            "And there were some scientists who measured the inside of her cavity, and when she bit his head off, she got more sperm. So his head actually acted as an inhibitor. And when that\u0027s gone, she gets the rest. So in the cases where the female bit the head off, she actually got more sperm. I suppose theoretically, therefore, more of her eggs are fertilized.",
            "He\u0027s very cautious around her. And his caution seems to originate in his head. So at this point, he\u0027s definitely still alive when she\u0027s only eaten his face off.",
            "And the world changed, because instead of just seeing patterns of swarming flies, I saw leg hairs and genitals and mouths. I saw them, I saw their lives, how they would kind of greet each other and what they would do. And I could see them being born, I could see them having sex, I could see them eating, I could see them flying, I could see them hanging out. And it was great. It was fascinating. So I\u0027d sit there for hours, or until they went to the bathroom on the glass enough I couldn\u0027t see anymore. And that\u0027s when I kind of got hooked into animals past a certain point of return.",
            "No, it takes a while to figure out that it\u0027s there.",
            "No, I don\u0027t think the pinkie understands there\u0027s a snake there.",
            "She\u0027s checking it out, smelling it, sniffing it, making sure it\u0027s OK, I guess.",
            "I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call it friendly.",
            "The two of them hanging out together, yeah. Their faces are about the same size-- well, no, the mouse\u0027s face is bigger. You see what I mean? There\u0027s no terror in the mouse.",
            "Hard to tell what makes something that small that happy.",
            "Hmm. Very strange.",
            "Hasn\u0027t happened like this before.",
            "When I first thought of this project, when it first dawned on me, what I was fishing around for, it kind of made my stomach hurt. The idea of raising animals to be eaten-- to photograph them specifically to be eaten-- was repugnant. It made me kind of sick. The more I\u0027ve thought of it, the more interesting I thought it was.",
            "No, and it has never squealed before.",
            "Pinkie was bigger, older.",
            "You look at the tail, you can usually tell. See, when the tail starts to droop down. Although it\u0027s getting so much blood pushed through there that that could keep it out.",
            "No, I don\u0027t think so. Now, maybe if I took one of my mice, went out into the middle of Broadway and started ripping it apart where everybody could see-- I don\u0027t know. And probably a legal person wouldn\u0027t know, because it never comes up.",
            "Yeah, your sides change. At one point, you feel really bad about the pinkie, and at one point, you\u0027re really happy your snake ate, and therefore it\u0027s really and it\u0027s going to live. In something like this, your sides always change. And when you put the pinkie up there before you put the snake up there, you feel really bad. You think, \"Oh, well, this little thing doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s about to be eaten.\"",
            "And with The Food Chain project, that was one of the points is that you take the side of the underdog. And then the underdog becomes a predator, and then you have to change sides again, and then you change sides again. I mean, it\u0027s arbitrary and relative anyway. So you just kind of get all confused, really.",
            "It\u0027s one thing to feed-- I was telling you this before-- to feed something to something where the pinkie has no senses yet, or it can\u0027t see. It can smell, but it can\u0027t see. But it\u0027s another when you pick up a full-grown mouse, who is aware of what\u0027s going on when it sees a snake. And I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when she starts eating full-grown mice. Right now, it\u0027s still something within the realm of something I can do. I don\u0027t know. Is there a line at which it starts being hard to do? Yeah, probably.",
            "No. It\u0027s getting kind of blue.",
            "Well, you never really like something to suffer. I definitely was not very happy. But the pinkie was going to die anyway.",
            "It\u0027s no different to the snake. The snake doesn\u0027t really seem to care if the mouse squeals or not. Is it any different to the mouse? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But it\u0027s dying anyway. It dies a little faster or it dies a little slower, possibly. I cared more. The snake didn\u0027t care. Who knows if the mouse did. So who matters? Whose opinion do I go by here? Why should I go by mine?",
            "So this is basically the food chain."

In this first picture, we have a caterpillar eating a tomato-- a brightly-colored close-up of that. The second picture, a praying mantis eats the caterpillar. And in the third picture, a tarantula eats the praying mantis. Catherine Chalmers takes these pictures in her own apartment in New York City where she also raises the animals that she feeds to each other. Paul Tough stopped by for a visit.",

            "If there were two emotions competing in Catherine Chalmers-- her fascination with the food chain and her disgust with what she was doing-- it becomes clear to me as she shows me her work that in the end, her fascination won out. She lays out a sequence of shots that begin with the praying mantis about to attack a caterpillar.",
            "You\u0027d think it would be easy to take pictures of predators eating their prey. That\u0027s what they do, after all. But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo one would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and photo two would just show a well-fed frog.",
            "Then there was the tarantula problem. Tarantulas can go for months without eating and days without moving. She\u0027d put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally, in one session, at 3:00 in the morning, after staring at her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the light box.",
            "At this point in The Food Chain, her pictures were becoming more and more vivid, but so was the suffering that she was watching through her lens.",
            "Growing up, Catherine Chalmers wasn\u0027t really an animal person. She always had a pet or two, nothing unusual. But then a few years ago, she was working on these sculptures, where she would take dead insects and glue them onto plants and flowers. She needed a lot of dead flies. More than she could buy anywhere.",
            "One of the things that The Food Chain photos have made Catherine think about is how we humans choose which channels we love and which ones we hate-- the distinction we make, basically, between pets and pests. She says most of us are attracted to animals that are like us-- that are mammals, that have round faces and big eyes like human infants. And she\u0027s not immune to that instinct. Her favorite animal is her dog, Leo.",
            "But she also finds herself drawn to the animals the we are supposed to fear and the moments in their lives that we usually turn away from. At the light box, she puts down four new photos from a different project, a series of shots of two praying mantises having sex.",
            "So he\u0027s on top of her.",
            "Isn\u0027t that kind of rare for animals? I thought animals were sort of-- do it quick.",
            "The photos aren\u0027t exactly grisly. There\u0027s no blood, not really even any color. But they\u0027re still pretty disturbing.",
            "And so she decided to start raising live flies in a glass cage in the corner of her apartment. She would just let them breed and wait for them to die. But then one day, she picked up a camera and looked at the flies through a close-up lens.",
            "What\u0027s that?",
            "And when does he die?",
            "Do you think he\u0027s dead there?",
            "What do you mean his head acts as an inhibitor?",
            "At the center of Catherine\u0027s studio, there are two glass cages where her mice live. There are about 20 mice in each cage of all ages. Some have just been born, still nursing from their mothers, some pregnant, some have been around for a few generations. It\u0027s the nicest part of the studio. The mice are all very clean and healthy and cute. And the cage even smells good. These mice are the centerpiece of Catherine\u0027s current project. She photographs them being born, and then photographs them being eaten by various predators.",
            "Today, she\u0027s going to take pictures of a two-day-old mouse, which is called a \"pinkie\" because it\u0027s too young to have fur. It just has pink skin. Its eyes are still closed, and it can barely move. Her 10-inch, pencil-thin snake, Pumpkin, hasn\u0027t eaten in almost a week. Today, Pumpkin\u0027s going to eat a pinkie.",
            "She puts the pinkie and the snake up on what she calls her set. This is where she takes all the pictures. It\u0027s chest high, about three feet by three feet with a white Formica surface that curves up at the back to form a seamless background. There are only two strobe lights, plus the third light underneath the surface to make sure the animals stay warm.",
            "Do you have to keep the snake away from the pinkie when you first put it down?",
            "Now, the pinkie started moving. Do you think--",
            "The snake\u0027s moving slowly, putting its head up right next to the pinkie and flicking out its tongue as if it wants to lick it.",
            "It\u0027s very friendly.",
            "She realized that there were two basic moments of life that she couldn\u0027t see in the flies\u0027 cage. She couldn\u0027t see them eating, and she couldn\u0027t see them dying. So she came up with this project that she called The Food Chain. She decided to raise a few different animals-- caterpillars, praying mantises, frogs, spiders-- and take pictures of each animal eating the one that came beneath it in the natural food chain.",
            "It just looks that way, the two of them together.",
            "But the mouse doesn\u0027t look that happy.",
            "We stood there for 15 minutes watching as the snake tried to decide what to do. The pinkie didn\u0027t move much, just sort of quivered, raising its head every once in a while. Then, finally, the snake made its move.",
            "What was strange was the way the snake attacked. Pumpkin is a constrictor, which means that usually, when it goes for its prey, it quickly wraps its body around it and squeezes it to death.",
            "This time, it bit the pinkie and held it in its fangs alive for a couple of minutes before it finally constricted it.",
            "Does the pinkie always struggle like that?",
            "What\u0027s the difference, do you think?",
            "Is it still alive now?",
            "I know you can be charged for being cruel to a dog. Can you be charged for being cruel to a mouse?",
            "Catherine says that we\u0027ve developed a hierarchy of death. Some animals, we\u0027re prohibited from killing, some, we\u0027re encouraged to kill, and most of them, we just don\u0027t care about. I asked her whether doing The Food Chain project changed the way she saw animals, and she said that it hadn\u0027t changed the way she saw them, it made her see them for the first time. Before she started photographing animals, she was like most people. She never really thought about them at all.",
            "And do you ever feel like you\u0027re taking sides when you set up a photograph like this?",
            "So Catherine began to fill her loft with animals. There isn\u0027t much furniture, but every surface has got terrariums and cages on it-- frogs and mealworms and a snake on one table; goldfish in the kitchen to feed the frogs; crickets, which chirp constantly; a tarantula and two cages full of mice. On a spare corner of the table where the frogs and the snake live, she\u0027s got a light box set up. And we sit down there to take a look at some of her pictures.",
            "It\u0027s getting to the point with the mouse project where those feelings are starting to have real repercussions. Right now, Pumpkin can\u0027t eat anything bigger than a pinkie. But she\u0027s growing. Eventually, she\u0027ll be three feet or more. Before long, she\u0027ll be eating full-grown mice, the ones that Catherine feeds and holds and plays with every day.",
            "Catherine talks about her apartment being like an oasis in the middle of SoHo. She loves coming home from the cars and concrete of Manhattan into a place that\u0027s filled with life. But in another way, it\u0027s Manhattan. It\u0027s our world that\u0027s the oasis in the middle of a planet that\u0027s full of nature. All around us, things are eating and having sex and dying and suffering. And we don\u0027t notice or even think about it.",
            "Do you think the pinkie\u0027s still alive?",
            "So did you feel weird at all when he was squealing at the end? Did that make you feel strange at all?",
            "I guess there\u0027s a difference if it\u0027s being fed, if there\u0027s a purpose to it, if it\u0027s part of the chain.",
            "At the end of our photo shoot, Catherine carefully picks up the snake and carries it back to its cage. There\u0027s a bulge about a third of the way down the snake\u0027s body where the pinkie is being digested. Before I leave, Catherine pours us a glass of wine, and we sit on the floor for a little while playing with a couple of her full-grown mice, letting them run over our hands and up our arms. They\u0027re tiny and warm, and through their fur, we can feel their little hearts beating.",
            "[MUSIC - \"INSECT COLLECTOR\" BY SHONEN KNIFE]",
            "The photos don\u0027t look like normal nature photography. They look more like fashion shots. The animals are brightly lit and sharply focused, pictured against a clear, white background."

In this first picture, we have a caterpillar eating a tomato-- a brightly-colored close-up of that. The second picture, a praying mantis eats the caterpillar. And in the third picture, a tarantula eats the praying mantis. Catherine Chalmers takes these pictures in her own apartment in New York City where she also raises the animals that she feeds to each other. Paul Tough stopped by for a visit."

And the thing\u0027s live and it\u0027s still kicking. And with the caterpillars, since all they do is eat, basically their body is just one long digestive system. And so whatever they are eating, as soon as she bites into it, it just spills out."

So I did different sequences of caterpillar with different-colored guts coming out."

It just blobs out. It\u0027s gruesome if you think about it in terms of your brother or your sister, but in terms of the fact that it is an insect and we seem less attached to the insect world than certainly the human world, it was very beautiful."

But it turns out to be more complicated than just putting a couple of animals together and snapping away. There are considerations of timing and staging. When she tried to have frogs eat the praying mantises, the problem was the frogs were simply too fast. Photo one would show a hungry frog and a praying mantis, and photo two would just show a well-fed frog."

She\u0027d put the spider and the praying mantis up on her set, and the tarantula would just stare at the praying mantis, completely still, one leg in the air, for hours. Finally, in one session, at 3:00 in the morning, after staring at her camera all night, Catherine got what she wanted. She slides the photos onto the light box."

And the praying mantis is upside down looking straight at you. And perfectly alive, looking at you, as the spider is munching on the middle part of his body. And then you see his head, and its antennas are waving around, and slowly, the head gets drawn more and more into the jaws. And it\u0027s still alive."

Unlike most insects, they have a head that moves like ours does-- on a neck. And so they turn and they look at you. And they\u0027ve got these big eyes sticking out. And they have some of the characteristics of the things which usually win human sympathy, which is big eyes and kind of an expression. And their mouth is red on the inside, so when they would eat something, it looked like they had red lipstick on. It was much easier to get attached to them."

I\u0027ve waited four hours and finally just went to bed and woke up in the morning. And the male was nowhere to be found. But then, one time, instead of him getting completely off of her, she caught him and wrapped her arms around him like she was holding him round the neck, like locking arm-in-arm, and she started eating him.

An acorn, a pecan, you name it, I\u0027ll try it. Sometimes I\u0027ll hide them. I\u0027ll dig them a grave for some later time when we have a cold wave. It ain\u0027t easy digging through thick ice and snow.",
            "Yes, sir,",
            "Well, the rest of it goes, I was searching for food then, was out on my rounds. My sister remarked that I gained a few pounds in my hips and my shoulders. She thought it looked smashing. I respect her opinion, and so I was dashing to something I saw. It resembled a kernel of corn, so I thought. But it seems the infernal nugget in question turned out to be gum. It was chewed in a wad just the size of a crumb. I was out of my mind then. I wanted a snack.",
            "So anyway, right, if my memory serves, I was searching the ground for some type of hors d\u0027oeurve when I heard in the distance the sound of a voice. It sounded quite angry, so I made the choice. I peeked through the window and sat on my haunches, and then I became, for a brief while, unconscious.",
            "It happens, sometimes. I have these brief spells. I can\u0027t say for certain, but something compels my brain to relax, causing me to black out. I was hit in the head with a large brussels sprout last summer. I think it was early July. I think that\u0027s the reason. I\u0027m not certain why.",
            "Technically, yes,",
            "My body was there, but my mind was dreaming. I was there at the scene. That I know for a fact. I was hoping by speaking I might could extract some details, something I maybe could mention to justify all of this lavish attention. I find it exciting, dramatic, suspense. It all suits me perfect because, in a sense, I enjoy public speaking. I love center stage.",
            "I might have, you know, but I can\u0027t say for certain. I know what I told you, but now I\u0027m revertin\u0027. Is this microphone on? Hello? Do you mind if I sing?"

            "It seemed like a lifetime. The worm took forever to inch to the stand and begin her endeavor.",
            "The worm had concluded. She\u0027d finished her say, and reached for a thimble of cold consomme.",
            "The cat said. I watched as a wren hopped to the floor where the cat once had been.",
            "The bird took a book written in Lebanese and carried it out past the pond to the trees.",
            "The angry worm hissed.",
            "Said the bird, keen on proving a point.",
            "She looked at the bird then, a certified goner. The wren whispered softly, as if to confirm, and then she lunged forward, beheading the worm.",
            "The cat yelled.",
            "The bird, in a grand show of physical fitness, finished the worm and returned to her perch, the lowest-hung branch of a young, silver birch.",
            "The cat called a witness, a chubby, black cricket I\u0027d seen once or twice in my room eat a ticket to movies or plays. This thing, it ate paper. Its body was small, just the size of a caper.",
            "Said the cricket, her vocal cords fierce in retort.",
            "Cried the bird. The cat yelled,",
            "The court was in chaos. The cricket hopped off. She flew through the air just like Baryshnikov. The bird then, she followed it into the thicket, and returned having eaten that hot-tempered cricket. There was no objection, no cry of foul play. The judge and the lawyers gave a silent OK.",
            "The judge barked.",
            "The bird said.",
            "The judge took an aspirin and shouted out--",
            "The cat took a watch from his pocket.",
            "There was no need to prompt her, no need to coerce the squirrel into talking. She set down her purse, and crossing her legs-- ladylike, at the shin-- the squirrel eyewitness began to weigh in.",
            "The cat cried.",
            "Said the squirrel.",
            "The cat lawyer cried.",
            "The bird said.",
            "The cat said.",
            "The squirrel said, beaming.",
            "I waited til late and crept out. It was dark. I was deep in the forest when I heard a bark. It was Kathleen, my spaniel, kneeling before an old dog-- a judge. And this elder, he wore a dark, floor-length robe. I think it was silk. He paused then and lapped from a bowl of skim milk.",
            "The bird then approached, feathers standing in rage.",
            "The bird slapped the stand with the tip of her wing and spat in disgust.",
            "She said. The cat flexed his paws, and then used them to shred that squirrel to ribbons. He tore it to bits and ate everything but her eyes and armpits. And then he pounced forward and firmly procured between his firm jaws that lawyering bird.",
            "That was all that I heard. The rest was too muffled. I watched for a while as the two of them scuffled. The cat took the bird right down to the beak. The judge rose, then asking if now he might speak.",
            "The judge then walked off and I watched as the cat foolishly followed that judge past a stump to a field of tires once used as a dump. I heard the cat hiss, then. I heard him yell, \"No.\" I can\u0027t say for certain who struck the first blow. But I can say who won. I know that the judge stepped out of his chambers unable to budge. He belched and he sagged, both lips heavy with fur, and looked out at the courtroom where others once were.",
            "He said to my spaniel.",
            "I heard Kathleen say.",
            "I waited for Kathleen beside a small creek. She passed me, despondent, refusing to speak. And me, I returned to my comfortable bed thinking of how, by some fluke, I\u0027d been led to animal court, that harsh, hostile scene, that by chance, thought to spare my companion, Kathleen."

            "It was August, and our plan was to chase one animal until it overheated and collapsed.",
            "And Lovejoy\u0027s right. He\u0027s a better runner than I am. In fact, most of the time, he\u0027d rather have me take my bicycle. So there\u0027s no question about me being slower. But as far as being clumsy-- Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally. That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do.",
            "So Lovejoy and many other anthropologists think it\u0027s crazy to assume that the survival strategy of the early hominids involved running after quadrupeds. They\u0027ve just got us beat, both in terms of speed and efficiency. But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it\u0027s a whole different ball game. He\u0027ll come with me and run for a while, but then he walks and lags behind. And sometimes, he just goes home. So if I\u0027m an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?",
            "Well, it\u0027s because he overheats. The main way that he and most other quadrupeds cool themselves when they run is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off of their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating. And then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin because we don\u0027t have a fur coat. So we can\u0027t run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat.",
            "And when you remember that we\u0027re using twice the energy, this seems like a very strange biological paradox. And it was this paradox, combined with the argument about not being able to hunt without tools, that made my brother and I decide it was time to try to run down an antelope.",
            "Antilocapra americana. The pronghorn. The second-fastest land mammal on the planet. We thought that if we could keep one running for two hours on a hot day, we\u0027d have it beat.",
            "[MEN RUNNING AND PANTING]",
            "We saw dust devils, horned toads, an eagle. We found a small lake, some badlands, and a rattlesnake.",
            "[SOUND OF RATTLESNAKE RATTLING]",
            "It never did get very hot that day, but in the afternoon, we had a good, long chase after a female and two males. They ran in circles around an area of about 10 square miles. There were two hills and a long, smooth valley in between, And the chase went up and around and back and forth between these hills, the antelope running short periods of time, but covering long distances, and then stopping and waiting for us to catch up. The two males ran behind the female, as if they were trying to protect her. And sometimes they\u0027d all go in different directions. But we stayed behind the female, and the males would eventually rejoin her.",
            "One thing we\u0027d learned the day before was that we could run much less distance than the antelopes by staying well inside their circle. And we were also starting to communicate with each other over long distances. For instance, if my brother was on top of one of the hills and he could see where the antelope were going, he\u0027d point, and I wouldn\u0027t have to run to the top of the hill.",
            "So we were running after these three and feeling pretty good about not letting them ditch us. And a couple times, we even got within 50 yards of them. And I\u0027d look into their eyes trying to see some sign of fear or fatigue. But all I kept seeing were very quiet animals that seemed to know exactly who we were, what we were proposing, and didn\u0027t seem to be in the least bit worried.",
            "Anyway, we ran after these three for about an hour, and then they found a large herd. Or the herd found them. And they ran up and over a hill. And by the time we got to the top of the hill, the herd had split into three groups of about three or four antelopes each. And each of the groups seemed to have at least one female that looked exactly like the one we\u0027d started chasing. The magic shell game trick again. We weren\u0027t really all that physically tired, Mainly mentally beaten. And we went home.",
            "I haven\u0027t gone back to Wyoming for the purpose of chasing antelope, but I drive through there sometimes on my way somewhere else. And one time last spring, I was going east and there was a train along the highway also going east at about the same speed. And suddenly, there were three antelope running alongside the engine, chasing it.",
            "It was incredible. It was even more incredible seeing the three of them simultaneously speed up, pull out in front of the engine, and fly across the tracks. I pulled over and waited for the train to go by. And there they were, three young males, looking back at me with those black eyes and hardly breathing at all."

I was able to follow them for about 30 minutes, but the problem was I wasn\u0027t sure if I was following the same ones I started following, because I started out following four-- a buck, two does, and a younger one. And after about 10 minutes, they ran into a group of about five more antelope, went over a hill, and then on the other side of the hill, they broke into two groups again.",
            "So I think I ended up following the same four, but I couldn\u0027t be sure. And I followed them for another 15 minutes, and then they ran into a much larger group, ran for a ways, and then followed that larger group for a while, And then that group broke into at least two more groups. And at that point, I just sort of gave up and quit following them because I didn\u0027t know which individuals I was chasing. And then I got confused on the roads. Where\u0027s the road we were on? Down here?",

It\u0027s a scientific argument, so it takes a few minutes to explain. Remember the scene in 2001 when an ape-man realizes he can use a bone as a weapon and murders another ape-man? And he throws the bone in the air and it becomes a space station orbiting the earth.",

It\u0027s called the hunting hypothesis, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with it except that we don\u0027t have any physical evidence to support it. We just haven\u0027t found any tools or weapons that are that old.",

And he thought that if we could do it, then maybe our early ancestors could have done it, too. Shortly before we went to Wyoming, I went to see Owen Lovejoy.

            "It could\u0027ve been the Serengeti, but we were no primitive hunters. We quickly realized we knew nothing about the animal we were chasing or the land we were running on. We ran after several herds that first day without much success.",
            "That night, sleeping out, I remember feeling very high in terms of elevation, like being dizzy. There weren\u0027t any clouds in the sky, and it just seemed like too much open space. Satellites in orbit, the moon in orbit, and antelope in the bushes, chewing their cuds, and laughing amongst themselves.",

So there\u0027s no question about me being slower. But as far as being clumsy-- Lovejoy calls bipedalism clumsy because of reasons that have to do with biomechanics. Running bipedally takes twice as much energy as running quadrupedally. That is, when my dog and I run, he uses half the energy that I do."

But the thing is, if my dog and I go running in the summer in the middle of the day, when temperatures hit 85 to 100 or more degrees, it\u0027s a whole different ball game. He\u0027ll come with me and run for a while, but then he walks and lags behind. And sometimes, he just goes home. So if I\u0027m an awkward and clumsy biped, why can I outrun my dog?"
        },
        {
          "text": "Well, it\u0027s because he overheats. The main way that he and most other quadrupeds cool themselves when they run is by breathing. The air coming in and going out of their mouth evaporates water off of their tongues. We do this too, but we do it all over our body by sweating. And then we get a nice flow of air directly over our skin because we don\u0027t have a fur coat. So we can\u0027t run as fast as a quadruped, but we can run farther, especially in high heat."
