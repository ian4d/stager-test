I was almost 21 years old. I could either marry somebody my own age and take another 10 years and finish the job of raising him, his mother started. Or I could marry a proven failure and I practice divorce law. I know there\u0027s all kinds of wonderful excuses for divorce, but by definition it\u0027s a failure. Or I could have found myself somebody who had proven himself to be a good husband, but maybe I didn\u0027t want to marry a 65-year-old widower.","So in Alex, there was no gamble. He was demonstrably a good husband, demonstrably a good father. So there was little risk to the situation.","It\u0027s having a man on your own terms. You know, he\u0027s in your bed. He\u0027s in your house at your invitation. The juggling act that so many women have to put on with respect to careers and family is so much relieved in our situation because there are so many of us to share those kinds of household duties and child rearing and husband taking care of. So I\u0027m able to go to work with a guilt free heart and child never sees the inside of a daycare center or anything like that. They\u0027re home with people who care about them.","Yes.","Yeah, we all work. We all work. About nine years ago three of us had babies all in the same year and there was one wife in particular that we really wanted to watch out for the kids while we were at work. And so we went to her and said how much is it going to take to get you to quit your job for a couple of years til the kids go to school? So she did that for us. Then she went back to work.","Yeah, the three of us paid her.","It was only fair, she was working hard.","Oh, only very recently because a friend of his had proposed to me also. But no, I didn\u0027t even know it existed when I was in college until I met my husband and his friend. I had no idea anybody was doing it modernly. I was aware of the LDS history of the last century.","Correct.","Well, we were separated by a thousand miles. He proposed by letter. And I flew down and spent my spring break my senior year with him and his family. He had married two of my best friends from college. So I came I thought as much to see them as him. But I just needed to check out the situation. And I went home married.","They were understandably upset. My dad was very educated, but a Montana cowboy and he told my brothers to get their rifles and they were coming after me.","My mother\u0027s a very educated, smart women and she was heartbroken, but she wasn\u0027t willing to give the association with her only daughter to maintain a point.","I see Alex every day for sure. Structurally, I have a home that I share with another wife just because it\u0027s so huge. But Margaret has her own place, Beau has our own place, Joanna has her own place. But we\u0027re all right close together.","It\u0027s not like if he\u0027s at Diane and [? Don\u0027s ?] house, I walk right in the front door and make myself at home. I mean, we enjoy each other\u0027s company. Margaret likes to say that he\u0027s more fun when there\u0027s more than one of us just because that\u0027s his nature. And yeah, there\u0027s three of us that have anniversaries real close together and it\u0027s a longstanding tradition for the four of us to go out to dinner together near those anniversary. You know, the family spends a lot of time together. The kids are very fond of one another from the different mothers.","20. And I\u0027d say about half are grown.","Yeah, we actually stay with him. He\u0027s got his own quarters. But over the years it\u0027s varied. When I was 20 I had one kind of sexual appetite and now that I\u0027m in my-- I hate to say this-- mid 40s, it\u0027s a little different. But in talking to my monogamous friends, I have that kind of exchange with him as often or more often than they do. You know, roughly average once a week. It just depends.","That\u0027s one of the huge advantages. That\u0027s a really nice thing. I mean, some of our funnest times have been when he\u0027s been like on a business trip and we\u0027ll get together and have a tequila party or something and just laugh our heads off. Just have a good time. Because the way the wives feel about one another is we\u0027re just extraordinarily proud of one another. We\u0027re extremely proud to be associated with one another. And we\u0027ve had women come into the situation and look into it. And we didn\u0027t like them, and we got rid of them. We\u0027re women. We\u0027re good at it.","It\u0027s de facto, OK? The rule is he\u0027ll marry whom he pleases. But he has learned over the years that if we don\u0027t like them, his relationship with them is going nowhere. So we\u0027ve chased off our share.","Well, you know, us American girls are raised to be very insecure and jealous. Neither of which is a trait that you would want to embrace. So in the early years I think as with any marriage, it takes a while to feel your way and get that security established. And yeah, there were times when I\u0027d go well, why-- gee, you know, I can see way he likes Margaret. She does that so well and I don\u0027t. But then after a while you go, yeah, but look what I do that Margaret doesn\u0027t. And he does that. That\u0027s his job is to give you that security that he loves you for what you are. And 25 years into this deal and we\u0027ve sort of got it down pat. We\u0027re not too threatened at all.","It\u0027s only a certain kind of people. For example, I had a son who he had a family. And I have a son. But anyway, a girl came to him who\u0027d grown up in our community and she said what I said. You\u0027re obviously a good father and husband. Can I marry you? And he really liked this girl. But he was blown away. He goes, I don\u0027t know if I can do this. And of course I knew him very well, my son. I said, Stewart, you\u0027re one of the few guys I think can. And he lasted like two months.","Well, usually two wives is very difficult. You really need a third to balance it out. But usually, the most common scenario is the two women will gang up on the guy.","More like 1 out of 1,000, if not 10,000.","It\u0027s not easy. That\u0027s why most of his boys will tell you they wouldn\u0027t entertain it because they know how difficult it is. Because they watch their dad do it.","Well, yeah. You got to be way smart. Like he says, how would you like eight women working your inventory 24 hours a day we? And we do. We do. We\u0027re strong willed, independent, say what we think.","I haven\u0027t met anybody that could do what Alex has done. I\u0027ve met polygamists, long-term polygamists, who I admire and respect for what they\u0027ve done. But in terms of demonstration, it doesn\u0027t come anything close to his family."],"spokenWords":["So in Alex, there was no gamble. He was demonstrably a good husband, demonstrably a good father.

My God, put a camera in front of that girl and she\u0027ll shine like a diamond! Between the single men and the job opportunities, her phone is going to be ringing right off the hook!","My father has always placed a great deal of importance on his daughter\u0027s physical beauty. It is to him, their greatest asset, and he monitors their appearance with an almost freakish intensity. Because it was always assumed that we would go to college, my brother and I were free to grow as plump and ugly as we liked. I might wander freely through the house drinking pancake batter from a plastic bucket, but the moment one of my sisters overspilled her bikini, our father was right there to mix his metaphors.","Jesus, Flossy, what are we running here, a dairy farm? Look at you, you\u0027re the size of a tank. Two few more pounds and you won\u0027t be able to cross state lines without a trucking license.","Three of my sisters responded to this pressure by losing themselves, however briefly, to drugs and alcohol. The one exception is my sister, Amy, who for as long as I can remember has chosen to lose herself in others.","For Amy, school was dedicated solely to the study or her teachers. She meticulously charted the reputation of their shoes and blouses and was quick to pinpoint their mannerisms. Practicing alone in the basement, she would pace before her king-sized blackboard in full costume.","Her imaginary classroom was a forum where the teachers ignored the lesson plan, preferring instead to discuss their elaborate home lives, which most often involved the bedridden mother forced to take oxygen through a tank. My sister turned that same eye on the adults my parents knew from the neighborhood and country club. Choosing from her box of wigs and castoff dresses, she would prepare herself a false cocktail and sat at the rec room bar, mastering their slurred inflections.","She was great as Flow Wagner and Eleanor Kelleher. But vocally, her best impersonation was of Penny Midland, a stylish, 50-year-old woman who work part-time at an art gallery my parents used to visit on a regular basis. Wearing a white page boy wig and one of my mother\u0027s better caftans, Amy began calling my father at the office.","Lou, Penny Midland here. How the hell are you? An awkward conversationalist, our father would fidget before saying, Penny. Well, what do you know? Gosh it\u0027s good be hear your voice.","The first few times she called, Amy discussed gallery business. But little by little, she began complaining about her husband, a Westinghouse executive named Van.","I want out, she\u0027d say. It isn\u0027t that I don\u0027t care for him as a friend, but at this point in my life I don\u0027t know that I can stay married to a man who, well, a man who likes boys. I don\u0027t know how else to say it. The man likes boys and that\u0027s the way it is.","Our father offered comfort with such standard noncommittal phrases as, \"I guess it takes two to tango,\" or \"You hang in there, baby.\"","Oh, Lou, it just feels so good to talk to someone who really understands.","I walked into the kitchen late one afternoon and came upon my 12-year-old sister propositioning her father.","I was thinking that maybe you and I could get together some time, just for laughs. Unless we felt like taking it to another level.","Amy studied her reflection in the oven door, brushing the white bangs away from her forehead with her heavily jeweled fingers.","All I\u0027m saying is that I find you to be a very attractive man. Is that a crime?","This was what my mother meant when she accused people of playing a dangerous game. Were my father to accept Penny\u0027s offer, Amy would have known him as a philanderer and wondered who else he might have slept with. Everything he\u0027d ever said would be called into question and scanned for possible sexual content. Was that really a business trip, or had he snuck off to Myrtle Beach with one of the Stravidies twins?","It is to his credit that our father was such a gentleman. Stammering that he was very flattered to be asked, he let Penny down as gently as possible. He offered to set her up with some available bachelors he knew from his office at IBM and told my sister to take care of herself. Adding that she was a very special woman who deserved to be happy.","It was years before Amy admitted what she had done. They were relatively uneventful years for our family and I imagine, a very confusing period of time for poor Penny Midland, who was frequently visited at the art gallery by my father and any number of his divorced business associates.","Here\u0027s the gal I was telling you about, he\u0027d say to Bob Sweetie or Tommy Lattermore. I think the two of you would make a dynamite couple. I swear to God. Maybe some night this week the two of you could slip away and maybe have a few drinks. Give it a try why don\u0027t you?","The passage of time has not altered my father\u0027s obsessive attention to my sister\u0027s weight and appearance. And because of that, most of them keep their distance, checking in only by phone.","Is it just my imagination, he\u0027ll ask, or has your voice gotten fatter? You sound chubby to me. Is everything OK?","Because she has maintained her beautiful skin and youthful figure, Amy is my father\u0027s greatest treasure. She is by far, the most attractive member of our family. Yet she spent most of her life admiring skin diseases and praying for a hump.","It\u0027s not fair that I can\u0027t grow a beard she\u0027ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wort to the side of her nose. Compliments are genuinely lost on her. She can\u0027t see any benefit to being herself and is constantly searching for what she considers a flattering disguise.","She\u0027s got all the neck braces and false teeth a person could want, and recently spent a good deal of money on a customized fatty suit she enjoys wearing beneath sweat pants as tight and uninviting as sausage casings.","She couldn\u0027t afford the matching top and is reduced to waddling the streets much like two women fused together in some sort of a cruel experiment. From the waist up, she\u0027s slim and fit, chugging forward on legs the size of tree trunks and followed by a wide, dimpled bottom so thick she could sit on a knitting needle and never feel a thing.","She wore it home last Christmas where our startled, heartbroken father met us at the airport. He managed to silence his disapproval on the short ride to the house, but the moment Amy stepped into the bathroom he turned to me shouting, what the hell has happened to her? Jesus Christ Almighty, this is tearing me apart. I\u0027m in real pain here.","What?","Your sister, that\u0027s what. The girl\u0027s ass is the size of a beanbag chair. I thought you were supposed to be keeping an eye on her?","I begged him to lower his voice. Please dad, don\u0027t mention it in front of her. Amy\u0027s very sensitive about her-- you know.","Her what? Go ahead and say it. Her big fat ass. That\u0027s what she\u0027s ashamed of, and she should be. Christ Almighty, they could land choppers on ass like that.","Oh, dad.","Don\u0027t try to defend her, wise guy. She\u0027s a single woman and the clock is ticking away. How is she supposed to find a husband with an ass like that?","Well, I said, a lot of men like that.","He looked at me with great pity and shook his head. What you don\u0027t know could fill a book.","My father composed himself when Amy re-entered the room, but the moment she opened the freezer door he acted as though she were tossing a lit match into the gas tank of his Porsche.","What in God\u0027s name are you doing? Look at you, you\u0027re killing yourself.","Amy hugged a quart of ice cream to her chest and searched the drawers for a shovel-sized spoon.","Your problem is that you\u0027re bored, my father said. You\u0027re bored and lonely and you\u0027re eating garbage to feel some kind of stinking void. I know what you\u0027re going through and believe me, you can lick this.","First of all, Amy said, I\u0027m not bored. And besides that, all I\u0027ve eaten today are a stack of pancakes, four donuts, a danish at the airport, and a couple of really small brownies on the plane. She kept it up until our father, his voice cracking with pain, offered to find her some professional help.","I\u0027m begging you to reach out before it\u0027s too late. We can do this together. There are programs and camps that specialize in this kind of thing. But first, you have to admit that you have a problem.","When Amy rejected his offer, he attempted to set an example. Settling down to Christmas dinner, he pretended to be satisfied with nothing but a sliver of white meat accompanied by a single spear of broccoli. His athletic regime became theatric. That felt great, he\u0027d say, finishing a round of sit-ups. Now I\u0027ll do some squat thrusts, a couple dozen pushups, and it\u0027s off for a satisfying run. Anyone want to join me? Amy?","She kept to her fatty suit until her legs were chafed and pimpled. It was on the morning of our return flight when she revealed her joke and our father, bracing himself against the countertop, wept with the light. Ha-ha he laughed as though he were reading the words off a page, the way he\u0027s always done. Ha-ha-ha, you really had me going. Ha-ha. I knew you\u0027d never let yourself go.","The fatty suit only reinvigorated him for the photo shoot he called about with such enthusiasm. She had me fooled for a minute there, but even with a fat ass, you can\u0027t disguise the fact that she\u0027s a beautiful person and that\u0027s what really matters. Do you happen to know if they\u0027re going to be hiring a professional hairstylist, someone who really knows what they\u0027re doing? I sure as hell hope so because her hair is awfully thin and someone needs to talk her into losing those bangs.","There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t tell my father when he calls asking after Amy. He wouldn\u0027t understand that she has no interest in getting married and was in fact, quite happy to break up with her live-in boyfriend.","He was a pleasant, hardworking fellow, whom she replaced with a dwarf rabbit named Tattletale. Tattletale enjoys chewing electrical cords, and as a result my sister\u0027s phone is often out of order. But it doesn\u0027t seem to bother her that available men can\u0027t get through.","The last time she was asked out by a successful bachelor she paused for a few moments before saying, thanks for asking, but I\u0027m really just not into white guys right now.","This alone would have given my father an aneurysm. The clock is ticking, he says. If she waits much longer she\u0027ll be alone for the rest of her life.","This seems to suit Amy just fine. For the time being, she seems perfectly content with her rabbit and an imaginary boyfriend she has named Ricky. We\u0027ll be walking the streets of her West Village neighborhood, running errands, when she\u0027ll turn to me saying, Ricky gave me a bumper pool table for our one-month anniversary. I came home this afternoon and there it was parked beside the baby grand electric organ he gave me for President\u0027s Day.","I didn\u0027t know you played pool, I\u0027ll say. When did you start? How did you learn?","Oh, a few months ago. Ricky taught me how to play on our last flight to Korea.","You didn\u0027t tell me he was Korean?","Oh, she\u0027ll say, he\u0027s not. He just has a lot of friends there, so we go to Korea a lot. She carries on like this and after a while, Ricky seems not only real, but very likable.","Hey, my father will ask, what do you know about this Ricky person? Amy seems to think he\u0027s really something.","What exactly has she told you? It\u0027s always best to ask what he\u0027s already heard. For all I know, Amy could have claimed that Ricky was a Navy SEAL, or the chief surgeon at a hospital specializing in diseases of the kidney or pancreas.","When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I feigned ignorance. I didn\u0027t tell him that at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed in flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. One by one, their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their lips and cheek bones.","When called fourth to the styling table, Amy said only, I want to look like someone has beaten me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on her forehead. Puss yellow pools surround her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with mean rows of brackish stitches.","Amy was enchanted with her new look. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry cleaner and grocery store. Most people nervously looked away. But on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible saying, I\u0027m in love. Can you believe it? I\u0027m finally, totally in love. And you know what? It feels great."],"spokenWords":["The passage of time has not altered my father\u0027s obsessive attention to my sister\u0027s weight and appearance.

For the time being, she seems perfectly content with her rabbit and an imaginary boyfriend she has named Ricky. We\u0027ll be walking the streets of her West Village neighborhood, running errands, when she\u0027ll turn to me saying, Ricky gave me a bumper pool table for our one-month anniversary. I came home this afternoon and there it was parked beside the baby grand electric organ he gave me for President\u0027s Day.","When Amy rejected his offer, he attempted to set an example. Settling down to Christmas dinner, he pretended to be satisfied with nothing but a sliver of white meat accompanied by a single spear of broccoli. His athletic regime became theatric. That felt great, he\u0027d say, finishing a round of sit-ups. Now I\u0027ll do some squat thrusts, a couple dozen pushups, and it\u0027s off for a satisfying run. Anyone want to join me? Amy?","She wore it home last Christmas where our startled, heartbroken father met us at the airport. He managed to silence his disapproval on the short ride to the house, but the moment Amy stepped into the bathroom he turned to me shouting, what the hell has happened to her? Jesus Christ Almighty, this is tearing me apart. I\u0027m in real pain here.","My father has always placed a great deal of importance on his daughter\u0027s physical beauty. It is to him, their greatest asset, and he monitors their appearance with an almost freakish intensity. Because it was always assumed that we would go to college, my brother and I were free to grow as plump and ugly as we liked. I might wander freely through the house drinking pancake batter from a plastic bucket, but the moment one of my sisters overspilled her bikini, our father was right there to mix his metaphors.","What exactly has she told you? It\u0027s always best to ask what he\u0027s already heard. For all I know, Amy could have claimed that Ricky was a Navy SEAL, or the chief surgeon at a hospital specializing in diseases of the kidney or pancreas.","She kept to her fatty suit until her legs were chafed and pimpled. It was on the morning of our return flight when she revealed her joke and our father, bracing himself against the countertop, wept with the light. Ha-ha he laughed as though he were reading the words off a page, the way he\u0027s always done. Ha-ha-ha, you really had me going. Ha-ha. I knew you\u0027d never let yourself go.","Amy studied her reflection in the oven door, brushing the white bangs away from her forehead with her heavily jeweled fingers.","Because she has maintained her beautiful skin and youthful figure, Amy is my father\u0027s greatest treasure. She is by far, the most attractive member of our family. Yet she spent most of her life admiring skin diseases and praying for a hump.","Our father offered comfort with such standard noncommittal phrases as, \"I guess it takes two to tango,\" or \"You hang in there, baby.\"","I walked into the kitchen late one afternoon and came upon my 12-year-old sister propositioning her father.","What?","The fatty suit only reinvigorated him for the photo shoot he called about with such enthusiasm. She had me fooled for a minute there, but even with a fat ass, you can\u0027t disguise the fact that she\u0027s a beautiful person and that\u0027s what really matters. Do you happen to know if they\u0027re going to be hiring a professional hairstylist, someone who really knows what they\u0027re doing? I sure as hell hope so because her hair is awfully thin and someone needs to talk her into losing those bangs.","For Amy, school was dedicated solely to the study or her teachers. She meticulously charted the reputation of their shoes and blouses and was quick to pinpoint their mannerisms. Practicing alone in the basement, she would pace before her king-sized blackboard in full costume.","This was what my mother meant when she accused people of playing a dangerous game. Were my father to accept Penny\u0027s offer, Amy would have known him as a philanderer and wondered who else he might have slept with. Everything he\u0027d ever said would be called into question and scanned for possible sexual content. Was that really a business trip, or had he snuck off to Myrtle Beach with one of the Stravidies twins?","I didn\u0027t know you played pool, I\u0027ll say. When did you start? How did you learn?","She\u0027s got all the neck braces and false teeth a person could want, and recently spent a good deal of money on a customized fatty suit she enjoys wearing beneath sweat pants as tight and uninviting as sausage casings.","It\u0027s not fair that I can\u0027t grow a beard she\u0027ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wort to the side of her nose. Compliments are genuinely lost on her. She can\u0027t see any benefit to being herself and is constantly searching for what she considers a flattering disguise.","Is it just my imagination, he\u0027ll ask, or has your voice gotten fatter? You sound chubby to me. Is everything OK?","Oh, dad.","I\u0027m begging you to reach out before it\u0027s too late. We can do this together. There are programs and camps that specialize in this kind of thing. But first, you have to admit that you have a problem.","The first few times she called, Amy discussed gallery business. But little by little, she began complaining about her husband, a Westinghouse executive named Van.","It was years before Amy admitted what she had done. They were relatively uneventful years for our family and I imagine, a very confusing period of time for poor Penny Midland, who was frequently visited at the art gallery by my father and any number of his divorced business associates.","Well, I said, a lot of men like that.","You didn\u0027t tell me he was Korean?","What in God\u0027s name are you doing? Look at you, you\u0027re killing yourself.","Three of my sisters responded to this pressure by losing themselves, however briefly, to drugs and alcohol. The one exception is my sister, Amy, who for as long as I can remember has chosen to lose herself in others.","All I\u0027m saying is that I find you to be a very attractive man. Is that a crime?","I want out, she\u0027d say. It isn\u0027t that I don\u0027t care for him as a friend, but at this point in my life I don\u0027t know that I can stay married to a man who, well, a man who likes boys. I don\u0027t know how else to say it. The man likes boys and that\u0027s the way it is.","When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I feigned ignorance. I didn\u0027t tell him that at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed in flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. One by one, their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their lips and cheek bones.","Oh, a few months ago. Ricky taught me how to play on our last flight to Korea.","Oh, she\u0027ll say, he\u0027s not. He just has a lot of friends there, so we go to Korea a lot. She carries on like this and after a while, Ricky seems not only real, but very likable.","Your problem is that you\u0027re bored, my father said. You\u0027re bored and lonely and you\u0027re eating garbage to feel some kind of stinking void. I know what you\u0027re going through and believe me, you can lick this.","Her what? Go ahead and say it. Her big fat ass. That\u0027s what she\u0027s ashamed of, and she should be. Christ Almighty, they could land choppers on ass like that.","When called fourth to the styling table, Amy said only, I want to look like someone has beaten me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on her forehead. Puss yellow pools surround her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with mean rows of brackish stitches.","Jesus, Flossy, what are we running here, a dairy farm? Look at you, you\u0027re the size of a tank. Two few more pounds and you won\u0027t be able to cross state lines without a trucking license.","Her imaginary classroom was a forum where the teachers ignored the lesson plan, preferring instead to discuss their elaborate home lives, which most often involved the bedridden mother forced to take oxygen through a tank. My sister turned that same eye on the adults my parents knew from the neighborhood and country club. Choosing from her box of wigs and castoff dresses, she would prepare herself a false cocktail and sat at the rec room bar, mastering their slurred inflections.","Lou, Penny Midland here. How the hell are you? An awkward conversationalist, our father would fidget before saying, Penny. Well, what do you know? Gosh it\u0027s good be hear your voice.","Oh, Lou, it just feels so good to talk to someone who really understands.","He looked at me with great pity and shook his head. What you don\u0027t know could fill a book.","Here\u0027s the gal I was telling you about, he\u0027d say to Bob Sweetie or Tommy Lattermore. I think the two of you would make a dynamite couple. I swear to God. Maybe some night this week the two of you could slip away and maybe have a few drinks. Give it a try why don\u0027t you?","The last time she was asked out by a successful bachelor she paused for a few moments before saying, thanks for asking, but I\u0027m really just not into white guys right now.","Hey, my father will ask, what do you know about this Ricky person? Amy seems to think he\u0027s really something.","My father called me late one recent Sunday evening, excited with the news that my sister, Amy, was scheduled to appear in a magazine article on young, New York women.","Amy was enchanted with her new look. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry cleaner and grocery store. Most people nervously looked away. But on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible saying, I\u0027m in love. Can you believe it? I\u0027m finally, totally in love. And you know what? It feels great.","It is to his credit that our father was such a gentleman. Stammering that he was very flattered to be asked, he let Penny down as gently as possible. He offered to set her up with some available bachelors he knew from his office at IBM and told my sister to take care of herself. Adding that she was a very special woman who deserved to be happy.","This alone would have given my father an aneurysm. The clock is ticking, he says. If she waits much longer she\u0027ll be alone for the rest of her life.","There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t tell my father when he calls asking after Amy. He wouldn\u0027t understand that she has no interest in getting married and was in fact, quite happy to break up with her live-in boyfriend.","My father composed himself when Amy re-entered the room, but the moment she opened the freezer door he acted as though she were tossing a lit match into the gas tank of his Porsche.","I begged him to lower his voice. Please dad, don\u0027t mention it in front of her. Amy\u0027s very sensitive about her-- you know.","Can you imagine, he asked. My God, put a camera in front of that girl and she\u0027ll shine like a diamond! Between the single men and the job opportunities, her phone is going to be ringing right off the hook!","She was great as Flow Wagner and Eleanor Kelleher. But vocally, her best impersonation was of Penny Midland, a stylish, 50-year-old woman who work part-time at an art gallery my parents used to visit on a regular basis. Wearing a white page boy wig and one of my mother\u0027s better caftans, Amy began calling my father at the office.","Amy hugged a quart of ice cream to her chest and searched the drawers for a shovel-sized spoon.","He was a pleasant, hardworking fellow, whom she replaced with a dwarf rabbit named Tattletale. Tattletale enjoys chewing electrical cords, and as a result my sister\u0027s phone is often out of order. But it doesn\u0027t seem to bother her that available men can\u0027t get through.","Your sister, that\u0027s what. The girl\u0027s ass is the size of a beanbag chair. I thought you were supposed to be keeping an eye on her?"]},"One Of The Hens":{"name":"One Of The Hens","episodes":{"99":"I Enjoy Being A Girl, Sort Of"},"statements":["I was the first pick up.","And they picked me up about 4 o\u0027clock.","4:00 AM.

My God, put a camera in front of that girl and she\u0027ll shine like a diamond! Between the single men and the job opportunities, her phone is going to be ringing right off the hook!","My father has always placed a great deal of importance on his daughter\u0027s physical beauty. It is to him, their greatest asset, and he monitors their appearance with an almost freakish intensity. Because it was always assumed that we would go to college, my brother and I were free to grow as plump and ugly as we liked. I might wander freely through the house drinking pancake batter from a plastic bucket, but the moment one of my sisters overspilled her bikini, our father was right there to mix his metaphors.","Jesus, Flossy, what are we running here, a dairy farm? Look at you, you\u0027re the size of a tank. Two few more pounds and you won\u0027t be able to cross state lines without a trucking license.","Three of my sisters responded to this pressure by losing themselves, however briefly, to drugs and alcohol. The one exception is my sister, Amy, who for as long as I can remember has chosen to lose herself in others.","For Amy, school was dedicated solely to the study or her teachers. She meticulously charted the reputation of their shoes and blouses and was quick to pinpoint their mannerisms. Practicing alone in the basement, she would pace before her king-sized blackboard in full costume.","Her imaginary classroom was a forum where the teachers ignored the lesson plan, preferring instead to discuss their elaborate home lives, which most often involved the bedridden mother forced to take oxygen through a tank. My sister turned that same eye on the adults my parents knew from the neighborhood and country club. Choosing from her box of wigs and castoff dresses, she would prepare herself a false cocktail and sat at the rec room bar, mastering their slurred inflections.","She was great as Flow Wagner and Eleanor Kelleher. But vocally, her best impersonation was of Penny Midland, a stylish, 50-year-old woman who work part-time at an art gallery my parents used to visit on a regular basis. Wearing a white page boy wig and one of my mother\u0027s better caftans, Amy began calling my father at the office.","Lou, Penny Midland here. How the hell are you? An awkward conversationalist, our father would fidget before saying, Penny. Well, what do you know? Gosh it\u0027s good be hear your voice.","The first few times she called, Amy discussed gallery business. But little by little, she began complaining about her husband, a Westinghouse executive named Van.","I want out, she\u0027d say. It isn\u0027t that I don\u0027t care for him as a friend, but at this point in my life I don\u0027t know that I can stay married to a man who, well, a man who likes boys. I don\u0027t know how else to say it. The man likes boys and that\u0027s the way it is.","Our father offered comfort with such standard noncommittal phrases as, \"I guess it takes two to tango,\" or \"You hang in there, baby.\"","Oh, Lou, it just feels so good to talk to someone who really understands.","I walked into the kitchen late one afternoon and came upon my 12-year-old sister propositioning her father.","I was thinking that maybe you and I could get together some time, just for laughs. Unless we felt like taking it to another level.","Amy studied her reflection in the oven door, brushing the white bangs away from her forehead with her heavily jeweled fingers.","All I\u0027m saying is that I find you to be a very attractive man. Is that a crime?","This was what my mother meant when she accused people of playing a dangerous game. Were my father to accept Penny\u0027s offer, Amy would have known him as a philanderer and wondered who else he might have slept with. Everything he\u0027d ever said would be called into question and scanned for possible sexual content. Was that really a business trip, or had he snuck off to Myrtle Beach with one of the Stravidies twins?","It is to his credit that our father was such a gentleman. Stammering that he was very flattered to be asked, he let Penny down as gently as possible. He offered to set her up with some available bachelors he knew from his office at IBM and told my sister to take care of herself. Adding that she was a very special woman who deserved to be happy.","It was years before Amy admitted what she had done. They were relatively uneventful years for our family and I imagine, a very confusing period of time for poor Penny Midland, who was frequently visited at the art gallery by my father and any number of his divorced business associates.","Here\u0027s the gal I was telling you about, he\u0027d say to Bob Sweetie or Tommy Lattermore. I think the two of you would make a dynamite couple. I swear to God. Maybe some night this week the two of you could slip away and maybe have a few drinks. Give it a try why don\u0027t you?","The passage of time has not altered my father\u0027s obsessive attention to my sister\u0027s weight and appearance. And because of that, most of them keep their distance, checking in only by phone.","Is it just my imagination, he\u0027ll ask, or has your voice gotten fatter? You sound chubby to me. Is everything OK?","Because she has maintained her beautiful skin and youthful figure, Amy is my father\u0027s greatest treasure. She is by far, the most attractive member of our family. Yet she spent most of her life admiring skin diseases and praying for a hump.","It\u0027s not fair that I can\u0027t grow a beard she\u0027ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wort to the side of her nose. Compliments are genuinely lost on her. She can\u0027t see any benefit to being herself and is constantly searching for what she considers a flattering disguise.","She\u0027s got all the neck braces and false teeth a person could want, and recently spent a good deal of money on a customized fatty suit she enjoys wearing beneath sweat pants as tight and uninviting as sausage casings.","She couldn\u0027t afford the matching top and is reduced to waddling the streets much like two women fused together in some sort of a cruel experiment. From the waist up, she\u0027s slim and fit, chugging forward on legs the size of tree trunks and followed by a wide, dimpled bottom so thick she could sit on a knitting needle and never feel a thing.","She wore it home last Christmas where our startled, heartbroken father met us at the airport. He managed to silence his disapproval on the short ride to the house, but the moment Amy stepped into the bathroom he turned to me shouting, what the hell has happened to her? Jesus Christ Almighty, this is tearing me apart. I\u0027m in real pain here.","What?","Your sister, that\u0027s what. The girl\u0027s ass is the size of a beanbag chair. I thought you were supposed to be keeping an eye on her?","I begged him to lower his voice. Please dad, don\u0027t mention it in front of her. Amy\u0027s very sensitive about her-- you know.","Her what? Go ahead and say it. Her big fat ass. That\u0027s what she\u0027s ashamed of, and she should be. Christ Almighty, they could land choppers on ass like that.","Oh, dad.","Don\u0027t try to defend her, wise guy. She\u0027s a single woman and the clock is ticking away. How is she supposed to find a husband with an ass like that?","Well, I said, a lot of men like that.","He looked at me with great pity and shook his head. What you don\u0027t know could fill a book.","My father composed himself when Amy re-entered the room, but the moment she opened the freezer door he acted as though she were tossing a lit match into the gas tank of his Porsche.","What in God\u0027s name are you doing? Look at you, you\u0027re killing yourself.","Amy hugged a quart of ice cream to her chest and searched the drawers for a shovel-sized spoon.","Your problem is that you\u0027re bored, my father said. You\u0027re bored and lonely and you\u0027re eating garbage to feel some kind of stinking void. I know what you\u0027re going through and believe me, you can lick this.","First of all, Amy said, I\u0027m not bored. And besides that, all I\u0027ve eaten today are a stack of pancakes, four donuts, a danish at the airport, and a couple of really small brownies on the plane. She kept it up until our father, his voice cracking with pain, offered to find her some professional help.","I\u0027m begging you to reach out before it\u0027s too late. We can do this together. There are programs and camps that specialize in this kind of thing. But first, you have to admit that you have a problem.","When Amy rejected his offer, he attempted to set an example. Settling down to Christmas dinner, he pretended to be satisfied with nothing but a sliver of white meat accompanied by a single spear of broccoli. His athletic regime became theatric. That felt great, he\u0027d say, finishing a round of sit-ups. Now I\u0027ll do some squat thrusts, a couple dozen pushups, and it\u0027s off for a satisfying run. Anyone want to join me? Amy?","She kept to her fatty suit until her legs were chafed and pimpled. It was on the morning of our return flight when she revealed her joke and our father, bracing himself against the countertop, wept with the light. Ha-ha he laughed as though he were reading the words off a page, the way he\u0027s always done. Ha-ha-ha, you really had me going. Ha-ha. I knew you\u0027d never let yourself go.","The fatty suit only reinvigorated him for the photo shoot he called about with such enthusiasm. She had me fooled for a minute there, but even with a fat ass, you can\u0027t disguise the fact that she\u0027s a beautiful person and that\u0027s what really matters. Do you happen to know if they\u0027re going to be hiring a professional hairstylist, someone who really knows what they\u0027re doing? I sure as hell hope so because her hair is awfully thin and someone needs to talk her into losing those bangs.","There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t tell my father when he calls asking after Amy. He wouldn\u0027t understand that she has no interest in getting married and was in fact, quite happy to break up with her live-in boyfriend.","He was a pleasant, hardworking fellow, whom she replaced with a dwarf rabbit named Tattletale. Tattletale enjoys chewing electrical cords, and as a result my sister\u0027s phone is often out of order. But it doesn\u0027t seem to bother her that available men can\u0027t get through.","The last time she was asked out by a successful bachelor she paused for a few moments before saying, thanks for asking, but I\u0027m really just not into white guys right now.","This alone would have given my father an aneurysm. The clock is ticking, he says. If she waits much longer she\u0027ll be alone for the rest of her life.","This seems to suit Amy just fine. For the time being, she seems perfectly content with her rabbit and an imaginary boyfriend she has named Ricky. We\u0027ll be walking the streets of her West Village neighborhood, running errands, when she\u0027ll turn to me saying, Ricky gave me a bumper pool table for our one-month anniversary. I came home this afternoon and there it was parked beside the baby grand electric organ he gave me for President\u0027s Day.","I didn\u0027t know you played pool, I\u0027ll say. When did you start? How did you learn?","Oh, a few months ago. Ricky taught me how to play on our last flight to Korea.","You didn\u0027t tell me he was Korean?","Oh, she\u0027ll say, he\u0027s not. He just has a lot of friends there, so we go to Korea a lot. She carries on like this and after a while, Ricky seems not only real, but very likable.","Hey, my father will ask, what do you know about this Ricky person? Amy seems to think he\u0027s really something.","What exactly has she told you? It\u0027s always best to ask what he\u0027s already heard. For all I know, Amy could have claimed that Ricky was a Navy SEAL, or the chief surgeon at a hospital specializing in diseases of the kidney or pancreas.","When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I feigned ignorance. I didn\u0027t tell him that at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed in flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. One by one, their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their lips and cheek bones.","When called fourth to the styling table, Amy said only, I want to look like someone has beaten me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on her forehead. Puss yellow pools surround her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with mean rows of brackish stitches.","Amy was enchanted with her new look. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry cleaner and grocery store. Most people nervously looked away. But on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible saying, I\u0027m in love. Can you believe it? I\u0027m finally, totally in love. And you know what? It feels great."],"spokenWords":["The passage of time has not altered my father\u0027s obsessive attention to my sister\u0027s weight and appearance.

How did you learn?","She\u0027s got all the neck braces and false teeth a person could want, and recently spent a good deal of money on a customized fatty suit she enjoys wearing beneath sweat pants as tight and uninviting as sausage casings.","It\u0027s not fair that I can\u0027t grow a beard she\u0027ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wort to the side of her nose. Compliments are genuinely lost on her. She can\u0027t see any benefit to being herself and is constantly searching for what she considers a flattering disguise.","Is it just my imagination, he\u0027ll ask, or has your voice gotten fatter? You sound chubby to me. Is everything OK?","Oh, dad.","I\u0027m begging you to reach out before it\u0027s too late. We can do this together. There are programs and camps that specialize in this kind of thing. But first, you have to admit that you have a problem.","The first few times she called, Amy discussed gallery business. But little by little, she began complaining about her husband, a Westinghouse executive named Van.","It was years before Amy admitted what she had done. They were relatively uneventful years for our family and I imagine, a very confusing period of time for poor Penny Midland, who was frequently visited at the art gallery by my father and any number of his divorced business associates.","Well, I said, a lot of men like that.","You didn\u0027t tell me he was Korean?","What in God\u0027s name are you doing? Look at you, you\u0027re killing yourself.","Three of my sisters responded to this pressure by losing themselves, however briefly, to drugs and alcohol. The one exception is my sister, Amy, who for as long as I can remember has chosen to lose herself in others.","All I\u0027m saying is that I find you to be a very attractive man. Is that a crime?","I want out, she\u0027d say. It isn\u0027t that I don\u0027t care for him as a friend, but at this point in my life I don\u0027t know that I can stay married to a man who, well, a man who likes boys. I don\u0027t know how else to say it. The man likes boys and that\u0027s the way it is.","When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I feigned ignorance. I didn\u0027t tell him that at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed in flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. One by one, their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their lips and cheek bones.","Oh, a few months ago. Ricky taught me how to play on our last flight to Korea.","Oh, she\u0027ll say, he\u0027s not. He just has a lot of friends there, so we go to Korea a lot. She carries on like this and after a while, Ricky seems not only real, but very likable.","Your problem is that you\u0027re bored, my father said. You\u0027re bored and lonely and you\u0027re eating garbage to feel some kind of stinking void. I know what you\u0027re going through and believe me, you can lick this.","Her what? Go ahead and say it. Her big fat ass. That\u0027s what she\u0027s ashamed of, and she should be. Christ Almighty, they could land choppers on ass like that.","When called fourth to the styling table, Amy said only, I want to look like someone has beaten me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on her forehead. Puss yellow pools surround her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with mean rows of brackish stitches.","Jesus, Flossy, what are we running here, a dairy farm? Look at you, you\u0027re the size of a tank. Two few more pounds and you won\u0027t be able to cross state lines without a trucking license.","Her imaginary classroom was a forum where the teachers ignored the lesson plan, preferring instead to discuss their elaborate home lives, which most often involved the bedridden mother forced to take oxygen through a tank. My sister turned that same eye on the adults my parents knew from the neighborhood and country club. Choosing from her box of wigs and castoff dresses, she would prepare herself a false cocktail and sat at the rec room bar, mastering their slurred inflections.","Lou, Penny Midland here. How the hell are you? An awkward conversationalist, our father would fidget before saying, Penny. Well, what do you know? Gosh it\u0027s good be hear your voice.","Oh, Lou, it just feels so good to talk to someone who really understands.","He looked at me with great pity and shook his head. What you don\u0027t know could fill a book.","Here\u0027s the gal I was telling you about, he\u0027d say to Bob Sweetie or Tommy Lattermore. I think the two of you would make a dynamite couple. I swear to God. Maybe some night this week the two of you could slip away and maybe have a few drinks. Give it a try why don\u0027t you?","The last time she was asked out by a successful bachelor she paused for a few moments before saying, thanks for asking, but I\u0027m really just not into white guys right now.","Hey, my father will ask, what do you know about this Ricky person? Amy seems to think he\u0027s really something.","My father called me late one recent Sunday evening, excited with the news that my sister, Amy, was scheduled to appear in a magazine article on young, New York women.","Amy was enchanted with her new look. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry cleaner and grocery store. Most people nervously looked away. But on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible saying, I\u0027m in love. Can you believe it? I\u0027m finally, totally in love. And you know what? It feels great.","It is to his credit that our father was such a gentleman. Stammering that he was very flattered to be asked, he let Penny down as gently as possible. He offered to set her up with some available bachelors he knew from his office at IBM and told my sister to take care of herself. Adding that she was a very special woman who deserved to be happy.","This alone would have given my father an aneurysm. The clock is ticking, he says. If she waits much longer she\u0027ll be alone for the rest of her life.","There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t tell my father when he calls asking after Amy. He wouldn\u0027t understand that she has no interest in getting married and was in fact, quite happy to break up with her live-in boyfriend.","My father composed himself when Amy re-entered the room, but the moment she opened the freezer door he acted as though she were tossing a lit match into the gas tank of his Porsche.","I begged him to lower his voice. Please dad, don\u0027t mention it in front of her. Amy\u0027s very sensitive about her-- you know.","Can you imagine, he asked. My God, put a camera in front of that girl and she\u0027ll shine like a diamond! Between the single men and the job opportunities, her phone is going to be ringing right off the hook!","She was great as Flow Wagner and Eleanor Kelleher. But vocally, her best impersonation was of Penny Midland, a stylish, 50-year-old woman who work part-time at an art gallery my parents used to visit on a regular basis. Wearing a white page boy wig and one of my mother\u0027s better caftans, Amy began calling my father at the office.","Amy hugged a quart of ice cream to her chest and searched the drawers for a shovel-sized spoon.","He was a pleasant, hardworking fellow, whom she replaced with a dwarf rabbit named Tattletale. Tattletale enjoys chewing electrical cords, and as a result my sister\u0027s phone is often out of order.

She met her husband when she was a senior in college."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, you look at somebody in my situation. I was almost 21 years old. I could either marry somebody my own age and take another 10 years and finish the job of raising him, his mother started. Or I could marry a proven failure and I practice divorce law. I know there\u0027s all kinds of wonderful excuses for divorce, but by definition it\u0027s a failure. Or I could have found myself somebody who had proven himself to be a good husband, but maybe I didn\u0027t want to marry a 65-year-old widower."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"So in Alex, there was no gamble. He was demonstrably a good husband, demonstrably a good father. So there was little risk to the situation."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Elizabeth Joseph is as an attorney and now public affairs director of a radio station in Utah. We offer her story as part of our show as another example in the continuum of how to be a woman or a girl. She says that because she was in a polygamist marriage, she could do things like go off to law school and finish school and not have to worry who was taking care of the kids or her husband. There were other wives around for that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In short, she says, polygamy is the ultimate feminist lifestyle."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s having a man on your own terms. You know, he\u0027s in your bed. He\u0027s in your house at your invitation. The juggling act that so many women have to put on with respect to careers and family is so much relieved in our situation because there are so many of us to share those kinds of household duties and child rearing and husband taking care of. So I\u0027m able to go to work with a guilt free heart and child never sees the inside of a daycare center or anything like that. They\u0027re home with people who care about them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Now your husband has eight wives?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And how many of the wives actually stay home? Do all of them work? Do just some of them work?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yeah, we all work. We all work. About nine years ago three of us had babies all in the same year and there was one wife in particular that we really wanted to watch out for the kids while we were at work. And so we went to her and said how much is it going to take to get you to quit your job for a couple of years til the kids go to school? So she did that for us. Then she went back to work."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And when you say, how much would it take you, did the rest of you pay her?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yeah, the three of us paid her."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It was only fair, she was working hard."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So when you first met your husband, had you been considering polygamy as an option?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Oh, only very recently because a friend of his had proposed to me also. But no, I didn\u0027t even know it existed when I was in college until I met my husband and his friend. I had no idea anybody was doing it modernly. I was aware of the LDS history of the last century."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The Mormon church, the Latter Day Saints Church? And when you met him, he was already married to five women at that point, right?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Correct."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How did a courtship happen? Like what actually happened?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, we were separated by a thousand miles. He proposed by letter. And I flew down and spent my spring break my senior year with him and his family. He had married two of my best friends from college. So I came I thought as much to see them as him. But I just needed to check out the situation. And I went home married."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What did your family say?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"They were understandably upset. My dad was very educated, but a Montana cowboy and he told my brothers to get their rifles and they were coming after me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"My mother\u0027s a very educated, smart women and she was heartbroken, but she wasn\u0027t willing to give the association with her only daughter to maintain a point."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Can I ask you to just explain kind of the practical terms of it? Like does everybody live in separate houses? Does everybody live in the same house? How often do you see Alex?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"I see Alex every day for sure. Structurally, I have a home that I share with another wife just because it\u0027s so huge. But Margaret has her own place, Beau has our own place, Joanna has her own place. But we\u0027re all right close together."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s not like if he\u0027s at Diane and [? Don\u0027s ?] house, I walk right in the front door and make myself at home. I mean, we enjoy each other\u0027s company. Margaret likes to say that he\u0027s more fun when there\u0027s more than one of us just because that\u0027s his nature. And yeah, there\u0027s three of us that have anniversaries real close together and it\u0027s a longstanding tradition for the four of us to go out to dinner together near those anniversary. You know, the family spends a lot of time together. The kids are very fond of one another from the different mothers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So how many kids are there in the family?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"20. And I\u0027d say about half are grown."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then, how often will he actually stay with you if I can ask you questions that personal."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yeah, we actually stay with him. He\u0027s got his own quarters. But over the years it\u0027s varied. When I was 20 I had one kind of sexual appetite and now that I\u0027m in my-- I hate to say this-- mid 40s, it\u0027s a little different. But in talking to my monogamous friends, I have that kind of exchange with him as often or more often than they do. You know, roughly average once a week. It just depends."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I\u0027ve heard Mormon men talk about polygamy and talking about the advantage of it as being this. They say that there\u0027s certain things that a woman looks to a man for in terms of wanting to talk about things and wanting to be close regarding certain kinds of issues and have a certain kind of close friendship that a lot of men just they don\u0027t talk that way. They don\u0027t relate to other people that way. And so one of the advantages of polygamy is that the women, the wives, can get that from the other wives."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"That\u0027s one of the huge advantages. That\u0027s a really nice thing. I mean, some of our funnest times have been when he\u0027s been like on a business trip and we\u0027ll get together and have a tequila party or something and just laugh our heads off. Just have a good time. Because the way the wives feel about one another is we\u0027re just extraordinarily proud of one another. We\u0027re extremely proud to be associated with one another. And we\u0027ve had women come into the situation and look into it. And we didn\u0027t like them, and we got rid of them. We\u0027re women. We\u0027re good at it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you have some sort of veto power over whether a woman actually gets to marry in?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s de facto, OK? The rule is he\u0027ll marry whom he pleases. But he has learned over the years that if we don\u0027t like them, his relationship with them is going nowhere. So we\u0027ve chased off our share."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And do people get jealous? Do you get jealous?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, you know, us American girls are raised to be very insecure and jealous. Neither of which is a trait that you would want to embrace. So in the early years I think as with any marriage, it takes a while to feel your way and get that security established. And yeah, there were times when I\u0027d go well, why-- gee, you know, I can see way he likes Margaret. She does that so well and I don\u0027t. But then after a while you go, yeah, but look what I do that Margaret doesn\u0027t. And he does that. That\u0027s his job is to give you that security that he loves you for what you are. And 25 years into this deal and we\u0027ve sort of got it down pat. We\u0027re not too threatened at all."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Is this something that you think should be widely recommended to people? Or do you feel like that you are just in a special situation with a special man and it\u0027s not applicable to other people\u0027s lives?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s only a certain kind of people. For example, I had a son who he had a family. And I have a son. But anyway, a girl came to him who\u0027d grown up in our community and she said what I said. You\u0027re obviously a good father and husband. Can I marry you? And he really liked this girl. But he was blown away. He goes, I don\u0027t know if I can do this. And of course I knew him very well, my son. I said, Stewart, you\u0027re one of the few guys I think can. And he lasted like two months."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And why do you think it didn\u0027t work for him?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, usually two wives is very difficult. You really need a third to balance it out. But usually, the most common scenario is the two women will gang up on the guy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But you\u0027re thinking like 1 out of 10 men that you know could do it or like it\u0027s more m 1 out a 100?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"More like 1 out of 1,000, if not 10,000."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s not easy. That\u0027s why most of his boys will tell you they wouldn\u0027t entertain it because they know how difficult it is. Because they watch their dad do it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And the main difficulty is just keeping everybody satisfied and happy?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, yeah. You got to be way smart. Like he says, how would you like eight women working your inventory 24 hours a day we? And we do. We do. We\u0027re strong willed, independent, say what we think."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"I haven\u0027t met anybody that could do what Alex has done. I\u0027ve met polygamists, long-term polygamists, who I admire and respect for what they\u0027ve done. But in terms of demonstration, it doesn\u0027t come anything close to his family."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Elizabeth Joseph in Utah."}]},"6":{"actNumber":6,"actName":"Credits","contributorMap":{"Announcer":{"name":"Announcer","episodes":{"99":"I Enjoy Being A Girl, Sort Of"},"statements":["PRI, Public Radio International."],"spokenWords":["PRI, Public Radio International."]},"Rebecca":{"name":"Rebecca","episodes":{"99":"I Enjoy Being A Girl, Sort Of"},"statements":["Ghetto hoochie mama.","Booty house girl."],"spokenWords":["Booty house girl.","Ghetto hoochie mama."]},"Ira Glass":{"name":"Ira Glass","episodes":{"99":"I Enjoy Being A Girl, Sort Of"},"statements":["Our website, www.thisamericanlife.org where you can listen to our programs for absolutely free or buy CDs of them.

My God, put a camera in front of that girl and she\u0027ll shine like a diamond! Between the single men and the job opportunities, her phone is going to be ringing right off the hook!"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"My father has always placed a great deal of importance on his daughter\u0027s physical beauty. It is to him, their greatest asset, and he monitors their appearance with an almost freakish intensity. Because it was always assumed that we would go to college, my brother and I were free to grow as plump and ugly as we liked. I might wander freely through the house drinking pancake batter from a plastic bucket, but the moment one of my sisters overspilled her bikini, our father was right there to mix his metaphors."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Jesus, Flossy, what are we running here, a dairy farm? Look at you, you\u0027re the size of a tank. Two few more pounds and you won\u0027t be able to cross state lines without a trucking license."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Three of my sisters responded to this pressure by losing themselves, however briefly, to drugs and alcohol. The one exception is my sister, Amy, who for as long as I can remember has chosen to lose herself in others."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"For Amy, school was dedicated solely to the study or her teachers. She meticulously charted the reputation of their shoes and blouses and was quick to pinpoint their mannerisms. Practicing alone in the basement, she would pace before her king-sized blackboard in full costume."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Her imaginary classroom was a forum where the teachers ignored the lesson plan, preferring instead to discuss their elaborate home lives, which most often involved the bedridden mother forced to take oxygen through a tank. My sister turned that same eye on the adults my parents knew from the neighborhood and country club. Choosing from her box of wigs and castoff dresses, she would prepare herself a false cocktail and sat at the rec room bar, mastering their slurred inflections."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"She was great as Flow Wagner and Eleanor Kelleher. But vocally, her best impersonation was of Penny Midland, a stylish, 50-year-old woman who work part-time at an art gallery my parents used to visit on a regular basis. Wearing a white page boy wig and one of my mother\u0027s better caftans, Amy began calling my father at the office."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Lou, Penny Midland here. How the hell are you? An awkward conversationalist, our father would fidget before saying, Penny. Well, what do you know? Gosh it\u0027s good be hear your voice."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"The first few times she called, Amy discussed gallery business. But little by little, she began complaining about her husband, a Westinghouse executive named Van."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"I want out, she\u0027d say. It isn\u0027t that I don\u0027t care for him as a friend, but at this point in my life I don\u0027t know that I can stay married to a man who, well, a man who likes boys. I don\u0027t know how else to say it. The man likes boys and that\u0027s the way it is."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Our father offered comfort with such standard noncommittal phrases as, \"I guess it takes two to tango,\" or \"You hang in there, baby.\""},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Oh, Lou, it just feels so good to talk to someone who really understands."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"I walked into the kitchen late one afternoon and came upon my 12-year-old sister propositioning her father."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"I was thinking that maybe you and I could get together some time, just for laughs. Unless we felt like taking it to another level."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Amy studied her reflection in the oven door, brushing the white bangs away from her forehead with her heavily jeweled fingers."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"All I\u0027m saying is that I find you to be a very attractive man. Is that a crime?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"This was what my mother meant when she accused people of playing a dangerous game. Were my father to accept Penny\u0027s offer, Amy would have known him as a philanderer and wondered who else he might have slept with. Everything he\u0027d ever said would be called into question and scanned for possible sexual content. Was that really a business trip, or had he snuck off to Myrtle Beach with one of the Stravidies twins?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"It is to his credit that our father was such a gentleman. Stammering that he was very flattered to be asked, he let Penny down as gently as possible. He offered to set her up with some available bachelors he knew from his office at IBM and told my sister to take care of herself. Adding that she was a very special woman who deserved to be happy."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"It was years before Amy admitted what she had done. They were relatively uneventful years for our family and I imagine, a very confusing period of time for poor Penny Midland, who was frequently visited at the art gallery by my father and any number of his divorced business associates."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Here\u0027s the gal I was telling you about, he\u0027d say to Bob Sweetie or Tommy Lattermore. I think the two of you would make a dynamite couple. I swear to God. Maybe some night this week the two of you could slip away and maybe have a few drinks. Give it a try why don\u0027t you?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"The passage of time has not altered my father\u0027s obsessive attention to my sister\u0027s weight and appearance. And because of that, most of them keep their distance, checking in only by phone."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Is it just my imagination, he\u0027ll ask, or has your voice gotten fatter? You sound chubby to me. Is everything OK?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Because she has maintained her beautiful skin and youthful figure, Amy is my father\u0027s greatest treasure. She is by far, the most attractive member of our family. Yet she spent most of her life admiring skin diseases and praying for a hump."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"It\u0027s not fair that I can\u0027t grow a beard she\u0027ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wort to the side of her nose. Compliments are genuinely lost on her. She can\u0027t see any benefit to being herself and is constantly searching for what she considers a flattering disguise."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"She\u0027s got all the neck braces and false teeth a person could want, and recently spent a good deal of money on a customized fatty suit she enjoys wearing beneath sweat pants as tight and uninviting as sausage casings."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"She couldn\u0027t afford the matching top and is reduced to waddling the streets much like two women fused together in some sort of a cruel experiment. From the waist up, she\u0027s slim and fit, chugging forward on legs the size of tree trunks and followed by a wide, dimpled bottom so thick she could sit on a knitting needle and never feel a thing."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"She wore it home last Christmas where our startled, heartbroken father met us at the airport. He managed to silence his disapproval on the short ride to the house, but the moment Amy stepped into the bathroom he turned to me shouting, what the hell has happened to her? Jesus Christ Almighty, this is tearing me apart. I\u0027m in real pain here."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"What?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Your sister, that\u0027s what. The girl\u0027s ass is the size of a beanbag chair. I thought you were supposed to be keeping an eye on her?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"I begged him to lower his voice. Please dad, don\u0027t mention it in front of her. Amy\u0027s very sensitive about her-- you know."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Her what? Go ahead and say it. Her big fat ass. That\u0027s what she\u0027s ashamed of, and she should be. Christ Almighty, they could land choppers on ass like that."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Oh, dad."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Don\u0027t try to defend her, wise guy. She\u0027s a single woman and the clock is ticking away. How is she supposed to find a husband with an ass like that?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Well, I said, a lot of men like that."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"He looked at me with great pity and shook his head. What you don\u0027t know could fill a book."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"My father composed himself when Amy re-entered the room, but the moment she opened the freezer door he acted as though she were tossing a lit match into the gas tank of his Porsche."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"What in God\u0027s name are you doing? Look at you, you\u0027re killing yourself."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Amy hugged a quart of ice cream to her chest and searched the drawers for a shovel-sized spoon."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Your problem is that you\u0027re bored, my father said. You\u0027re bored and lonely and you\u0027re eating garbage to feel some kind of stinking void. I know what you\u0027re going through and believe me, you can lick this."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"First of all, Amy said, I\u0027m not bored. And besides that, all I\u0027ve eaten today are a stack of pancakes, four donuts, a danish at the airport, and a couple of really small brownies on the plane. She kept it up until our father, his voice cracking with pain, offered to find her some professional help."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"I\u0027m begging you to reach out before it\u0027s too late. We can do this together. There are programs and camps that specialize in this kind of thing. But first, you have to admit that you have a problem."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"When Amy rejected his offer, he attempted to set an example. Settling down to Christmas dinner, he pretended to be satisfied with nothing but a sliver of white meat accompanied by a single spear of broccoli. His athletic regime became theatric. That felt great, he\u0027d say, finishing a round of sit-ups. Now I\u0027ll do some squat thrusts, a couple dozen pushups, and it\u0027s off for a satisfying run. Anyone want to join me? Amy?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"She kept to her fatty suit until her legs were chafed and pimpled. It was on the morning of our return flight when she revealed her joke and our father, bracing himself against the countertop, wept with the light. Ha-ha he laughed as though he were reading the words off a page, the way he\u0027s always done. Ha-ha-ha, you really had me going. Ha-ha. I knew you\u0027d never let yourself go."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"The fatty suit only reinvigorated him for the photo shoot he called about with such enthusiasm. She had me fooled for a minute there, but even with a fat ass, you can\u0027t disguise the fact that she\u0027s a beautiful person and that\u0027s what really matters. Do you happen to know if they\u0027re going to be hiring a professional hairstylist, someone who really knows what they\u0027re doing? I sure as hell hope so because her hair is awfully thin and someone needs to talk her into losing those bangs."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t tell my father when he calls asking after Amy. He wouldn\u0027t understand that she has no interest in getting married and was in fact, quite happy to break up with her live-in boyfriend."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"He was a pleasant, hardworking fellow, whom she replaced with a dwarf rabbit named Tattletale. Tattletale enjoys chewing electrical cords, and as a result my sister\u0027s phone is often out of order. But it doesn\u0027t seem to bother her that available men can\u0027t get through."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"The last time she was asked out by a successful bachelor she paused for a few moments before saying, thanks for asking, but I\u0027m really just not into white guys right now."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"This alone would have given my father an aneurysm. The clock is ticking, he says. If she waits much longer she\u0027ll be alone for the rest of her life."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"This seems to suit Amy just fine. For the time being, she seems perfectly content with her rabbit and an imaginary boyfriend she has named Ricky. We\u0027ll be walking the streets of her West Village neighborhood, running errands, when she\u0027ll turn to me saying, Ricky gave me a bumper pool table for our one-month anniversary. I came home this afternoon and there it was parked beside the baby grand electric organ he gave me for President\u0027s Day."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"I didn\u0027t know you played pool, I\u0027ll say. When did you start? How did you learn?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Oh, a few months ago. Ricky taught me how to play on our last flight to Korea."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"You didn\u0027t tell me he was Korean?"},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Oh, she\u0027ll say, he\u0027s not. He just has a lot of friends there, so we go to Korea a lot. She carries on like this and after a while, Ricky seems not only real, but very likable."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Hey, my father will ask, what do you know about this Ricky person? Amy seems to think he\u0027s really something."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"What exactly has she told you? It\u0027s always best to ask what he\u0027s already heard. For all I know, Amy could have claimed that Ricky was a Navy SEAL, or the chief surgeon at a hospital specializing in diseases of the kidney or pancreas."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"When my father called asking about the photo shoot, I feigned ignorance. I didn\u0027t tell him that at the scheduled time, my sister arrived at the studio with unwashed hair and took her place beside a half dozen women carefully dressed in flattering outfits. She waited while the others had their hair styled into the current fashion. One by one, their brows were trained while makeup artists made the most of their lips and cheek bones."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"When called fourth to the styling table, Amy said only, I want to look like someone has beaten me up really, really bad. The makeup artist did a fine job. The black eyes and purple jaw were accentuated by a series of scratch marks on her forehead. Puss yellow pools surround her blistered nose and her swollen lips were fenced with mean rows of brackish stitches."},{"speakerName":"David Sedaris","text":"Amy was enchanted with her new look. Following the photo shoot, she wore her bruises to the dry cleaner and grocery store. Most people nervously looked away. But on the rare occasion someone asked what had happened, my sister smiled as brightly as possible saying, I\u0027m in love. Can you believe it? I\u0027m finally, totally in love. And you know what? It feels great."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"David Sedaris is the author most recently of, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, and editor of the collection, Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules: An Anthology of Outstanding Stories. This story was originally written for Vogue magazine, which then rejected it without explanation. One Vogue employee speculated that perhaps it did not conform enough with Vogue\u0027s notions of feminine beauty."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"David\u0027s sister Amy is among other things, a star of the TV show and someday to be released movie, Strangers with Candy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"[MUSIC- \"I\u0027M A WOMAN\" BY PEGGY LEE]"},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Act Two, How To Be a Man. Well, one of the problems in doing a show like we\u0027re doing this week, a show made of different stories that seem to go together because they were all about, at some level, different ways of being a woman or a girl, is that you find yourself treading around all these broad generalizations about men and women that actually none of us really believe. But we figured, we came this far with this theme, we might as well head down the river into the heart of darkness of gender cliches. And playing the Martin Sheen role in our little gender apocalypse now will be Sarah Miller."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Sarah Miller for a while, had the odd job of being a woman who wrote a sex column for men in a men\u0027s magazine, Details. That job seemed to consist mostly of correcting guys gross misperceptions about women. We sent her to a class we heard about in New York City run by a woman named Diane Tore. A class that tries to teach women how to dress and walk and talk like men. So it\u0027s kind of a reverse on her regular job."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Sarah Miller put on a loose fitting flannel shirt and tried to imagine transforming herself not just into any man, but into the kind of man who does not have a kind of ambiguous mix of traditionally male and female traits. She would become a guy\u0027s guy."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"I have to admit the idea of the workshop made me anxious. Just before I went I told a friend that I was afraid I already seemed like a guy. I\u0027m tall, I\u0027m loud, I swear a lot. I told them I was afraid that Diane would say something to me like, God, you\u0027re a natural. And I would take this to mean, you are naturally coarse and masculine. And naturally, not at all pretty."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"I shouldn\u0027t have worried. It turns out there\u0027s a whole world of gestures and attitudes between me in a flannel shirt and me being mistaken for a man. There\u0027s the proper way to walk, for example. Diane demonstrated."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"Sense of resolution ownership. Sense that when I walk into this room, anything, anybody, could be mine. I could own anything and anybody, or everything, in this room. For that moment that my eyes rest there. So that sense of ownership is conveyed in the gaze."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"They\u0027re not afraid to take up the space or to own the space. Or to check things out. How\u0027s this place structured?"},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"So when you walk you think you have a perimeter, a boundary of about three foot around you, OK? And this [UNINTELLIGIBLE], the way he walks, it\u0027s coming from the shoulders. The hips are tight and he goes side to side at the same time he goes forward. So it\u0027s like this 360 degrees moat around me, OK?"},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"Then we gave it a try. I thought slumping was the quickest route to maleness, but when I looked around I saw the other stood ramrod straight. We examined each other for clues."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"And maybe just introduce yourself to different people in the room. Just shake hands. Don\u0027t smile. Stop smiling."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"Smiling was the one thing none of us could seem to cut out. Diane had to remind us again and again. So as it became clear to me that I was not going to leave as a convincing man, I manufactured a goal for myself. I was here, I decided, to learn arrogance."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"Yeah. So you want to cover the nipples first of all. Going to start wrapping from the bottom."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"An ACE bandage, my sisters, is the first tool you need on your path to gender liberation. Mine was double wide. It kept snapping out of my hands as I wrapped it around my chest."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"It\u0027s got to be quite tight. But not so tight that you can\u0027t breath. That\u0027s ridiculous. So remember, you\u0027re going to be wearing this the whole day and evening. So should be OK. All right, here we go."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"This was the actual song we were listening to as we wrapped our chest down. Diane had brought along a tape called \"Frat Rock\" to enhance that double X chromosome vibe we were all striving for."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"[MUSIC PLAYING - BAD COMPANY - CAN\u0027T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE]"},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"My clothes, two big Levi\u0027s, a plaid flannel shirt, a Princeton t-shirt with Hebrew letters, all would have hung nicely on a guy\u0027s broad shoulders and slim hips. But I looked a little lumpy. My breasts had not disappeared so much as retreated under extreme duress to the middle of my chest. Two sad, misplaced lumps uncertain of their meaning. My whiskers were good, but my eyes-- Diane pointed this out about all of us-- retained the hopeful sweetness of femininity. And if I resembled anything, it was only some strange hybrid of a lumberjack, lady from Lady and the Tramp, and Marie Antoinette."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"I made up a new identity. Now my name was Dan Rosen. I was a Brown dropout who worked at St. Mark\u0027s Bookshop. I stacked the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] readers. I bought Paul Auster novels on discount. My parents lived in Mt. Kisco and were lame. Brown was lame. I was lame."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"I\u0027m Dan. I\u0027m Dan."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"The thing is that you are using the same [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"Hello, hello, hello."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"--rhythm."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"I\u0027m Dan and my boobs hurt."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"As Dan I sat down for my eating lesson and I noticed that none of us were really winning any surprises in the realness department. Two of the girls had long hair tied back in ponytails. When you looked at them you had a split second to decide if they were women dressed up as men or the Allman Brothers, and it wasn\u0027t a tough call."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"One of them asked Diane how we should be sitting."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"With your legs open. Until you\u0027re taking as much space as possible."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"Really?"},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"Yeah, you see guys on diners. You sit next to them and they\u0027ll be in these little round seats. And their knees will be pushing right into your--"},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"On a subway."},{"speakerName":"Diane","text":"The subways as well."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"We could sit and eat with our legs as wide as we wanted, but we were not men. One of the Allman Brothers spent the meal nibbling her way through about half a piece of pita bread. Eating it with the slow deliberation of one not at peace with food. The other Allman Brother looked a little bit like a guy, but she had this way of nodding and saying, uh hmm when she listened and it gave her away."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"Only Diane, dressed up as her alter ego, Dan King, looked like a guy. It was the eyes more than anything else. Her\u0027s were cool, detached. They assumed rather than asked. We were all too eager and naive looking. I said that we looked like little does tenderly eating grass and everyone laughed."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"When we finished eating, the place was a mess. Food, napkins, and take-out containers everywhere. No one wanted clean up. We sat in our men\u0027s clothes, staring at everything, not moving. I knew what we were thinking."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"So now we got to get some [BLEEP] bitches to clean this [BLEEP] up, huh?"},{"speakerName":"Woman 1","text":"Yeah."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"My highest hope for the workshop once I realized I was in very little danger of actually resembling a man, was that I would have some great insight into the mystery of what makes men men and women women. But I think there\u0027s no mystery left. The train of gender is too familiar, full of places we visited way too many times."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"Men are detached, unapologetic, unafraid to take up space. Women are conciliatory and self-effacing. Men gulp, women sip. I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s anything Diane or anyone could say that would really surprise any of us."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"I did have one moment in the workshop where I was walking across the floor, shoulders hunched, lips in a scowl, where I felt what it must be like to Dan Rosen. College dropout, keeper of the magazine section. Is this it, I thought? Is this what it feels like to be a guy?"},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"But I realized that what I felt-- useless, defensive, underachieving, bored, tragically adolescent-- was not about feeling like a guy, but about remembering what it felt like to be in my early 20s. What it felt like to be a failure. And I don\u0027t need to be in drag to tap into that."},{"speakerName":"Sarah Miller","text":"As our graduation ceremony for the workshop, we wanted to go to a men\u0027s club to watch strippers. But it was a Sunday night in Giuliani\u0027s New York and we couldn\u0027t find a single one open. I was secretly relieved when we ended up at a restaurant in the West Village. Right there in the booth I surreptitiously unwrapped my chest. I ordered a Diet Coke and a salad."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Sarah Miller. These days she writes a column for Men\u0027s Health magazine. Her novel, Inside the Mind of Gideon Rayburn, is coming out this March."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Coming up, polygamy as feminist lifestyle. That\u0027s in a minute from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"It\u0027s This American Life, I\u0027m Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and reporters and everyday people to come in and speak on that theme. Today on our program, I Enjoy Being a Girl, Sort Of."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In this second half of our program, we turned the stories of individual women and girls to stories of groups of women and girls. We have arrived at Act Three, Strength in Numbers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This is the story about one group of women. And I have to say that every woman working on this show at some point during this last week has expressed a little envy for the women in this group. And I think maybe the best way to start their story is with their road trip. Barbara, Jewel, Lynn, Tiny, Valerie, and Rosetta decided to leave the husbands and kids and grandkids behind and hit the road."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"I was the first pick up."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"And they picked me up about 4 o\u0027clock."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"4 o\u0027clock in the morning?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"4:00 AM. We arrived at the donut place and they were not open. They did not open til 7:00."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"That is sad when you arrive at the donut place-- you were earlier then."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"They were not open."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"And they would not open to 7:00 on the dot."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"We\u0027re waiting on 6 o\u0027clock, so we can go into the donut place."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"I think [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in there."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"We got three hens in the car planning on how we could go up to Rosewood hospital and sneak up in the room."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So it\u0027s like 4:00 in the morning. Sometime between 4:00 and 6:00 in the morning on a Friday morning and you decide you\u0027re going to visit one of your friends, one the hens who\u0027s in the hospital before you hit the road."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"That was going to be a break in."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Yeah, but you know I thought we\u0027d kind of pose as doctors and we\u0027re coming to see [? Marilyn Jones. ?] There\u0027s a special case. They do it on TV all the time."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"I can flash my DCFS badge."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"I was going to play like I worked for DCFS. I do work for DCFS."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Department of Children and Family Services."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Department of Children and Family Services."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"State agency."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"So I was going to show my ID and said that I had to talk to her about her kids."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"At 5:00 in the morning? I\u0027m from DCFS, I got to talk to you about your kids at 5:00 in the morning."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Now see, I was the last one they picked up, so I didn\u0027t know anything about that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And your reaction was?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"I would not have agreed with that."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"My [UNINTELLIGIBLE] out. I\u0027m with DCFS legal. I need to have her sign some papers."},{"speakerName":"Rosetta","text":"She has high blood pressure and her sugar is up, so we don\u0027t want to excite her too much, but we want to give her that hen love."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Well, not right now, Rosetta."},{"speakerName":"Rosetta","text":"And hen love."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Give her a big hug and kiss."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The Hens. Most of them have known each other since they were teenagers, growing up in Inglewood on Chicago\u0027s south side. A couple joined the group when they were working with other hands at the switchboard at The Palmer House, a fancy Chicago Hotel. Nine women. And every March they take a big trip together or they throw a party. Like the dinner dance they threw for themselves and their families where everybody wore white and gold. Everybody."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"This March, they took a tape recorder and drove from Chicago to a casino in Mississippi and back in three days. They visited a stray Hen who works down at the casino, Sally."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Three of the Hens-- Jewel, Tiny, and Lynn came into the studio to talk about trip and explain what the Hens are all about."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"In the South, they say that when it\u0027s a bunch of women that get together, a bunch of hens."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Yeah, they say it in kind of a mean way."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Yeah, but we didn\u0027t take it as being means."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Hens to the Hilt."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Hilt. That was our original name."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Because when we traveled, we only stayed at Hilton Hotels."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Well, hell, your husband said something about they ain\u0027t nothing but a bunch of hens."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Bunch of hens. Now he did say that in a mean way."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"In a very mean way."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And you guys will help each other out, like if somebody\u0027s out of work or if somebody needs some money. You guys will help out?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"We just did something like that recently. The last barbecue holiday. Valerie\u0027s son went out to the army, so we came together with our families and had a big barbecue. And at that barbecue we scraped together the little money that we had left to send him off to let him know we care. And sent him off with money in his pocket with all our phone numbers and our addresses. Have you got a letter yet?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"I haven\u0027t gotten anything yet."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"But we know he\u0027s doing fine. We try to do things like that to let each other\u0027s family know that we care."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So when your kids were growing up, when your kids were coming up, would you have a lot of contact with each other, talking about all the stuff they were doing?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"My kids basically stay with Jill and Barbara all the time."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"We all had apartments next door to each other.

Because you were heading from Illinois from Chicago through Tennessee, all the way to--"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"12. It took us 12 hours."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"You drove 12 straight hours more or less? And where did you--"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Oh, we stopped. Oh, we stopped at a great place."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"And I got this great restaurant in Lambert\u0027s. Home of the throwed rolls. It\u0027s like, Jill, what you talking about? I said, you guys, they throw the rolls at you. People in the place throwing rolls and you have to catch them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Throwing rolls at you?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Throwing dinner rolls at you. Hot dinner rolls at you."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Catch, catch, catch!"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Because their rolls are so good that they couldn\u0027t serve them fast enough. So one day the owner just threw one and that\u0027s how it started. So all you have to do is hold up your hand and they throw it and you catch it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Now there\u0027s a recording of this and somebody apparently is not doing a very good job doing the catching."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Me."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"All right, so what\u0027s the name of this place for people listening on the radio--"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Lambert\u0027s."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Lambert\u0027s and where is it?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"At interstate 57 and 55 there\u0027s Lambert\u0027s."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Every time we get together is not fun and games, but then when we get together the following time we laugh about it. Because the last time we went to Oakbrook that really wasn\u0027t fun."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Why? What happened?"},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"For years, Valerie has always so to speak, picked on Tony. Tony. You know because Tony is the slow one. She\u0027s very slow. You have to wait for her."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Help her. She walks with a cane sometime."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Yeah, you know, so she can\u0027t decide what she wants to put on. And so this particular night, Valerie just picked on Tony one too many times. It was about some pictures or something. So the next thing I know, Tony had jumped up out her chair and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. It was like RoboCop. She said, whoomp, whoomp, whoomp."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"Coming over there to get Valerie."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Just stomps across the room."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"No, Sally and I looked at each other.

We left from there because I said I\u0027m not-- we left."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"That\u0027s the closest to a couple hens fighting."},{"speakerName":"One Of The Hens","text":"But it wasn\u0027t funny at the time. But we get together now and we laugh about it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"There\u0027s a point where you guys are in the van and you got into this conversation about abortion that began when somebody was talking about these stories in the newspaper.

Because most of you had your kids when you were teenagers."},{"speakerName":"Tiny","text":"Right. We all did."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then Barbara says-- she\u0027s kind of off mike.

She met her husband when she was a senior in college."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, you look at somebody in my situation. I was almost 21 years old. I could either marry somebody my own age and take another 10 years and finish the job of raising him, his mother started. Or I could marry a proven failure and I practice divorce law. I know there\u0027s all kinds of wonderful excuses for divorce, but by definition it\u0027s a failure. Or I could have found myself somebody who had proven himself to be a good husband, but maybe I didn\u0027t want to marry a 65-year-old widower."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"So in Alex, there was no gamble. He was demonstrably a good husband, demonstrably a good father. So there was little risk to the situation."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Elizabeth Joseph is as an attorney and now public affairs director of a radio station in Utah. We offer her story as part of our show as another example in the continuum of how to be a woman or a girl. She says that because she was in a polygamist marriage, she could do things like go off to law school and finish school and not have to worry who was taking care of the kids or her husband. There were other wives around for that."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"In short, she says, polygamy is the ultimate feminist lifestyle."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s having a man on your own terms. You know, he\u0027s in your bed. He\u0027s in your house at your invitation. The juggling act that so many women have to put on with respect to careers and family is so much relieved in our situation because there are so many of us to share those kinds of household duties and child rearing and husband taking care of. So I\u0027m able to go to work with a guilt free heart and child never sees the inside of a daycare center or anything like that. They\u0027re home with people who care about them."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Now your husband has eight wives?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yes."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And how many of the wives actually stay home? Do all of them work? Do just some of them work?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yeah, we all work. We all work. About nine years ago three of us had babies all in the same year and there was one wife in particular that we really wanted to watch out for the kids while we were at work. And so we went to her and said how much is it going to take to get you to quit your job for a couple of years til the kids go to school? So she did that for us. Then she went back to work."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And when you say, how much would it take you, did the rest of you pay her?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yeah, the three of us paid her."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It was only fair, she was working hard."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So when you first met your husband, had you been considering polygamy as an option?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Oh, only very recently because a friend of his had proposed to me also. But no, I didn\u0027t even know it existed when I was in college until I met my husband and his friend. I had no idea anybody was doing it modernly. I was aware of the LDS history of the last century."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"The Mormon church, the Latter Day Saints Church? And when you met him, he was already married to five women at that point, right?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Correct."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"How did a courtship happen? Like what actually happened?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, we were separated by a thousand miles. He proposed by letter. And I flew down and spent my spring break my senior year with him and his family. He had married two of my best friends from college. So I came I thought as much to see them as him. But I just needed to check out the situation. And I went home married."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"What did your family say?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"They were understandably upset. My dad was very educated, but a Montana cowboy and he told my brothers to get their rifles and they were coming after me."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"My mother\u0027s a very educated, smart women and she was heartbroken, but she wasn\u0027t willing to give the association with her only daughter to maintain a point."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Can I ask you to just explain kind of the practical terms of it? Like does everybody live in separate houses? Does everybody live in the same house? How often do you see Alex?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"I see Alex every day for sure. Structurally, I have a home that I share with another wife just because it\u0027s so huge. But Margaret has her own place, Beau has our own place, Joanna has her own place. But we\u0027re all right close together."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s not like if he\u0027s at Diane and [? Don\u0027s ?] house, I walk right in the front door and make myself at home. I mean, we enjoy each other\u0027s company. Margaret likes to say that he\u0027s more fun when there\u0027s more than one of us just because that\u0027s his nature. And yeah, there\u0027s three of us that have anniversaries real close together and it\u0027s a longstanding tradition for the four of us to go out to dinner together near those anniversary. You know, the family spends a lot of time together. The kids are very fond of one another from the different mothers."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"So how many kids are there in the family?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"20. And I\u0027d say about half are grown."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And then, how often will he actually stay with you if I can ask you questions that personal."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Yeah, we actually stay with him. He\u0027s got his own quarters. But over the years it\u0027s varied. When I was 20 I had one kind of sexual appetite and now that I\u0027m in my-- I hate to say this-- mid 40s, it\u0027s a little different. But in talking to my monogamous friends, I have that kind of exchange with him as often or more often than they do. You know, roughly average once a week. It just depends."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"I\u0027ve heard Mormon men talk about polygamy and talking about the advantage of it as being this. They say that there\u0027s certain things that a woman looks to a man for in terms of wanting to talk about things and wanting to be close regarding certain kinds of issues and have a certain kind of close friendship that a lot of men just they don\u0027t talk that way. They don\u0027t relate to other people that way. And so one of the advantages of polygamy is that the women, the wives, can get that from the other wives."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"That\u0027s one of the huge advantages. That\u0027s a really nice thing. I mean, some of our funnest times have been when he\u0027s been like on a business trip and we\u0027ll get together and have a tequila party or something and just laugh our heads off. Just have a good time. Because the way the wives feel about one another is we\u0027re just extraordinarily proud of one another. We\u0027re extremely proud to be associated with one another. And we\u0027ve had women come into the situation and look into it. And we didn\u0027t like them, and we got rid of them. We\u0027re women. We\u0027re good at it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Do you have some sort of veto power over whether a woman actually gets to marry in?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s de facto, OK? The rule is he\u0027ll marry whom he pleases. But he has learned over the years that if we don\u0027t like them, his relationship with them is going nowhere. So we\u0027ve chased off our share."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And do people get jealous? Do you get jealous?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, you know, us American girls are raised to be very insecure and jealous. Neither of which is a trait that you would want to embrace. So in the early years I think as with any marriage, it takes a while to feel your way and get that security established. And yeah, there were times when I\u0027d go well, why-- gee, you know, I can see way he likes Margaret. She does that so well and I don\u0027t. But then after a while you go, yeah, but look what I do that Margaret doesn\u0027t. And he does that. That\u0027s his job is to give you that security that he loves you for what you are. And 25 years into this deal and we\u0027ve sort of got it down pat. We\u0027re not too threatened at all."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Is this something that you think should be widely recommended to people? Or do you feel like that you are just in a special situation with a special man and it\u0027s not applicable to other people\u0027s lives?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s only a certain kind of people. For example, I had a son who he had a family. And I have a son. But anyway, a girl came to him who\u0027d grown up in our community and she said what I said. You\u0027re obviously a good father and husband. Can I marry you? And he really liked this girl. But he was blown away. He goes, I don\u0027t know if I can do this. And of course I knew him very well, my son. I said, Stewart, you\u0027re one of the few guys I think can. And he lasted like two months."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And why do you think it didn\u0027t work for him?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, usually two wives is very difficult. You really need a third to balance it out. But usually, the most common scenario is the two women will gang up on the guy."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"But you\u0027re thinking like 1 out of 10 men that you know could do it or like it\u0027s more m 1 out a 100?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"More like 1 out of 1,000, if not 10,000."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Wow."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"It\u0027s not easy. That\u0027s why most of his boys will tell you they wouldn\u0027t entertain it because they know how difficult it is. Because they watch their dad do it."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"And the main difficulty is just keeping everybody satisfied and happy?"},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"Well, yeah. You got to be way smart. Like he says, how would you like eight women working your inventory 24 hours a day we? And we do. We do. We\u0027re strong willed, independent, say what we think."},{"speakerName":"Elizabeth Joseph","text":"I haven\u0027t met anybody that could do what Alex has done. I\u0027ve met polygamists, long-term polygamists, who I admire and respect for what they\u0027ve done. But in terms of demonstration, it doesn\u0027t come anything close to his family."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Elizabeth Joseph in Utah."},{"speakerName":"Ira Glass","text":"Our website, www.thisamericanlife.org where you can listen to our programs for absolutely free or buy CDs of them.
