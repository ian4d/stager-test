Don\u0027t worry. You won\u0027t get lonely.\"",
        "A roommate at a nudist trailer park. The combination of these elements presented a staggering tableau, made all the more incomprehensible when I heard the man shoulder the phone and raise his voice to shout, \"Mom! Hey, mom!

I made my reservations and planned to arrive in one week.",

The inhabitants of the room leaned forward in their chairs, biting the ridges of their clenched fists and groaning when confronted with the words \"cold front.\" They booed the weatherman. They cursed him, and then they pounded upon the table tops, much like prisoners unhappy with their food.",
        "The room was filled with the rhythmic thuds of protest as I sat down my suitcase and approached the front desk. \"He did this,\" a man said, pointing his crooked finger in my direction. \"Brought this nastiness with him down from the lakes.\"",

And oh, it\u0027s a good time. Some good times, yeah. We can\u0027t do it this year. It attracted too many bees and files, which pretty much occupied the field for the next few months.

Every now and then, I might call a friend who says, \"You caught me on the way to the shower,\" but that\u0027s different. The man at the nudist colony sounded as though he had been naked for years. Even his voice was tanned.",

        "In this afternoon\u0027s mail, I received my brochure, along with a pamphlet that reads \"Body acceptance is the idea. Nude recreation is the way. Bring your towels and suntan lotion and relax with us. You will experience a freedom of movement that cannot be felt with clothes, the freedom to be yourself.\"",
        "The brochure pictures a swimming pool, playground, sun deck, and the inevitable volleyball court, which leads me to wonder, what is it with these people and volleyball? The two go hand in hand. When I think nudist, I don\u0027t think penis. I think net.",
        "Last night, I was in a foul mood and provoked Hugh into a fight, goading him until he fled the room, shouting, \"You\u0027re a big, fat, hairy pig.\" Big is something I can live with. Fat is open to interpretation. But when coupled with hairy, it begins to form a mental picture which is brought into sharp focus when joined by the word \"pig.\" A big, fat, hairy, pig. If I were nudist, Hugh\u0027s words wouldn\u0027t have hurt me, as I would\u0027ve accepted myself for who I am.",
        "I phoned the colony to make a reservation and spoke to the same fellow who had mailed me the brochure. This time, I could hear people in the background, splashing and yelling in merriment. The sound of them made me giddy, and I unbuttoned my slacks.",
        "The brochure had mentioned rental cabins, and I was wondering what it might cost to stay for a week. \"You want a trailer for how long?\" he asked. I re-fastened my pants. A trailer? I had pictured tree-shaded bungalows, paneled in knotty pine. That, to me, is the essence of the word \"colony.\" This place, instead, was a nudist trailer park.",

I arrived early on this cold and wet afternoon, the cab driver dumping me off in front of the clubhouse before squealing away. Something about the place seemed to make him nervous, and he couldn\u0027t wait to get back into town. I collected my bag and entered a low, clapboard building where five fully dressed senior citizens sat hugging themselves against the cold and watching the local news on a color television bolted to a high shelf. On the screen, a weatherman was pointing to a map studded with frowning clowns-- clouds.",

It turned cold around Scranton, but I didn\u0027t even get off the bus. It\u0027s the truth. You can ask the driver.\" It was ridiculous to stand before a group of strangers, denying my responsibility for the weather. But at the moment, the charges seemed entirely plausible.",
        "\"You mean, the one with the rust-colored band?\"",
        "I asked where I might find a key to my trailer and heard a round of muffled laughter coming from the far corners of the room.",
        "I walked up the gravel lane to my trailer, which had been sprayed with so much insecticide it curled the hairs in my nose. Raisin-sized flies lay gasping on the countertops, their upturned legs signing the words--",
        "I set down my suitcase and fled, trotting past the clubhouse to the soggy volleyball court. The same pool I had seen in the brochure was now covered by a tarp, as was the hot tub. Even the flag was at half mast.",
        "I woke this morning to a fog so thick I couldn\u0027t see the picnic table in my front yard. From the sky to the ground, everything was the exact same shade of gray. It was cold, too, maybe in the low 50s.",
        "Late last night, my water shut off. And it didn\u0027t kick in again until 8 o\u0027clock this morning. I got dressed and went to the clubhouse, where I spoke to the woman at the front desk, who wore a turtleneck sweatshirt and drank cocoa from a mug she held with both hands.",
        "She reached beneath the counter and pulled out two marshmallows, which she stuffed into her mug.",
        "The fog burned off slowly. By 6 o\u0027clock, it was clear and sunny. And I looked out my window to see a naked couple strutting across the grounds with a pair of tennis racquets. The man wore his hair long in the back and carried himself as if he were dressed in a fine suit, his stride confident and purposeful, while the woman trotted behind him wearing a sun visor, knee socks, and sneakers.",
        "These were the first active nudists I had seen. And I put on my pants and followed them, taking a seat beside the pavilion and pretending to read a book. The man had an ample stomach and a broad, dimpled ass which jiggled and swayed as he leapt about the court, attempting to return his partner\u0027s serves. They played for maybe five minutes before the man placed his hands on his knees, released a mouthful of bile onto the grass, and called it quits. They left the court, and I followed them into the clubhouse, where the man stepped into the bathroom, and the woman spoke to our hostess, who stood behind the counter, sorting change.",
        "The women had always been so cold to me but fell over herself making sure the married couple found everything to their liking. I heard the toilet flush, and the man re-entered the room with a bright red ring around his ass. Here, I thought, was a real nudist. And I stared at him as though he had just stepped down from a flying saucer. There was a tuft of toilet paper, just slight, clinging to his bottom. And when his wife pointed it out, he ran his hand along his crack and casually shrugged, as though it were nothing more significant than a dab of mayonnaise on his lips.",
        "Looking out my bedroom window, I could see the clubhouse and its parking area. Earlier today, I watched as a large trailer pulled up, marked with Maryland plates and led by a four-door late-model car. This was someone arriving to park their trailer and stay for the summer.",
        "The car door opened, and a man stepped out, completely naked. He\u0027d been driving like that on the highway. I guess he just couldn\u0027t wait.",
        "I spoke to a woman in the sauna who said--",
        "\"I beg your pardon?\" Pudding toss, I thought it must be some expression like \"sock hop.\" \"Pudding isn\u0027t conducive to being tossed, is it?\"",
        "This is Sunday, and looking out my window, I\u0027ve noticed a lot of people come to the nudist park right after church. I watch as they stand beside their cars, removing their sober suits and stripping off their dresses. One of today\u0027s guests was a Presbyterian minister, a plump, freckle-faced man with Daffy Duck tattooed on his ass.",
        "I\u0027ve seen plenty of tattoos, but none I\u0027ve wanted to kick quite like that duck. He wore it with a swagger, calling attention to a body part the Lord had clearly not blessed with muscle tone or unblemished skin. The duck\u0027s beak was distended, and he appeared to be picking at a rash of strawberries.",
        "There are quite a few new faces today. A black man arrived in the company of two enormous white women, whose bodies were dual masses of rolling, dimpled flesh. Fat spilled over their knees, and their stomachs fell like heavy sacks of bird feed. Legs like tree trunks led straight into sandals, with no mention of ankle or discernible calf.",
        "This was the only black person I\u0027d seen all week. And by the time he left, it had been decided that--",
        "I\u0027ve taken to joining the group of seniors who gather naked each evening to watch Wheel of Fortune on the clubhouse TV.",
        "It\u0027s an odd sensation, watching television this way. Because they are dressed, the people on TV seem even more remote than usual.",
        "I liked the idea of that, filming two separate versions of any given program, one clothed and one naked. \"Do I have to?\" Peter Jennings would ask.",
        "Due to the pleasant weather, the tarp has been taken off the swimming pool, which is surround it by comfortable reclining chairs, several of them positioned beneath a sign reading Handicapped Parking. It is a posted rule that you have to be naked inside the pool area. And I was just getting used to the idea when I was approached by a man named Dusty, who had clothes-pinned a piece of shirt cardboard to the brim of his sun visor in order to extend its shading capacities.",
        "The man was doubled over, stopped with osteoporosis, his back and shoulders burnished like fine Italian leather, and his belly white from lack of sun. He wore his thick, gray hair cut close to his head and favored mirrored sunglasses, which reflected the sight of my pale, fidgety nakedness. I asked him a question about the hot tub. And two hours later, he\u0027d worked the subject around to the zoning ordinances of his hometown.",
        "\"I don\u0027t think that legally, you\u0027re allowed to build a grocery store in my neighborhood, because it\u0027s not zoned for that. Oh, there used to be a little mom and pop operation where you could buy bread and soda and so forth, but that\u0027s been closed down and turned into a little church for the snake handlers. You might could put up an apartment building in my area, but first you\u0027d have to check with the city council, because I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s zoned for that. How big of a place did you want to put up?\"",

        "He mugged, widening his face into a loopy, exaggerated grin, and running the tip of his tongue around the track of his lips. \"We just a group of bumpkins, are we?\" His attitude was both playful and hostile, and was shared by many of the people I met during my stay. Something about New York seemed to rub people the wrong way. This was a family campground. And New York was, to many of them, the place where wholesome families are shot down for sport.",
        "Tonight was a scheduled hobo slumgullion, and we were instructed to bring our canned vegetables to the pavilion by noon. I took the only canned good in my pantry and carried it down the hill, where I found two naked women wearing chef\u0027s hats and stirring a cauldron of ground beef and water.",
        "I set down my can of corn and asked what they meant by hobo slumgullion.",
        "It struck me as an odd choice for a theme party. You hardly ever hear the word \"hobo\" anymore. To me, it always carried a romantic connotation. But now, it\u0027s been replaced by the word \"homeless.\"",
        "I returned to the pavilion at the scheduled time, where 50 people sat eating out of cans. One man had smeared some charcoal on his cheeks. He wore a tie against this bare chest and carried a stick, onto which he had fastened a plastic grocery bag. Everyone else was naked, so he won the prize."

            "It was between plays. The coach was talking to the offense in the huddle, drawing on his sketch board, reprimanding somebody for screwing up the last play. We were standing around, waiting. We were the defense, and we had no coach. We had three or four formations we\u0027d run, but we\u0027d never made a call until the last minute.",
            "I remember, because I made the calls. I was the monster man, the free safety, the captain of the defense. And I\u0027d often call one formation as the offense broke huddle, and then stand back and wait until everyone was set, the quarterback going through his count, and then call another formation, just so everything would change shape right before the ball was snapped.",
            "This added the elements of surprise and chaos to our attack. It made the offense respect and fear us. And often, their plays crumbled under the disorder we caused. I realize now I must have learned this strategy from my mother, who was at that time going crazy from a painful divorce.",
            "But there was this day, this practice I was talking about before, when the coach was in the offensive huddle. The sun was going down, and the practice was coasting to an end. We, the Highland Mighty Mite defense, were standing around quietly, minds empty, like 12-year-old desperadoes, waiting for a train. I was standing there, spacing out with everyone else.",
            "And then, I had this new feeling. I was conscious of being inside a shell, my by helmet and shoulder pads, looking out at the world, like my uniform and even my body were just protective packaging. I felt weightless. I was in love with the air, the smell of the grass, the warm light and the cottonwood trees at the edge of the field.",

            "I called a huddle and said, \"We\u0027re going to do something different this time. We\u0027ll line up in a regular 6-3 formation. But as they get set, I\u0027m going to say a haiku. And I want you guys to start moving around. Dance around. Stand on your head. Do whatever you want. We\u0027ll kill them.\"",
            "The offense came out of their huddle, and we went into a 6-3. And just as the quarterback started his count, I yelled, \"The wind brings dry leaves, enough to build a fire.\" And my defense stood up and looked at each other, and then looked at me, and didn\u0027t do anything.",
            "It was so weird that the offense stood up, too. And then the coach blew his whistle and yelled, \"What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s the problem?\" Nobody spoke. He looked at me and said, \"Carrier, what are you doing?\"",
            "I said, \"We\u0027re running a haiku.\" He said, \"A what?\" \"A haiku,\" I said. \"We learned it today in school. \u0027The wind brings dry leaves, enough to build a fire.\u0027\"",

I\u0027m making noodle soup and coca tea, as this is all the food we have left. Jenkins, Wyatt, and Mitsunaga are reading. My brother wants me to teach him some Spanish.",
            "\"Huesos del condor, los quiero huesos del condor.\" I\u0027m telling him \"bones of the condor,\" trying to make it simple. \"Donde esta?\" Over there is \"A ya,\" usually with a hand signal. \"En las montanas,\" up in the mountains, \"a selva,\" the jungle, \"oriental.\" He\u0027s paying attention, repeating, trying to memorize.",

For two days, they tried the northwest ridge, and then spent the third day out on the north face, where Mitsunaga fell 50 feet, cartwheeling down a [UNINTELLIGIBLE], and Jenkins held him without a [? belay. ?] It was very steep on snow, rock, and ice. They were all scared and decided to bivouac in a snow cave.",
            "That evening, my brother watched a condor ride a thermal up the face of the mountain. He was looking down on it for 5,000 vertical feet. And when it was at the same level, they looked each other in the eye. Then we watched it from below as it went up another 1,000 feet and flew off over the top of the mountain.",
            "The next morning, they decided to come back to base camp to get some more food. But there is no more food in base camp. And they\u0027re so hungry and mean-spirited, they think I ate everything. But really, they took the good stuff, the sardines, the sugar, and the butter, and ate it while they were climbing.",
            "To get even, I tell them the story of the best meal I\u0027ve ever had. I was hitchhiking through Montreal, coming from Alaska, going to Miami. And this woman driving a Mercedes picked me up and asked me if she could cook dinner for me. She said her husband was on call at the hospital, and she didn\u0027t like to eat alone. She was in her late 40s or early 50s, with the face of a falcon, quick, delicate eyes. She had a hypnotic voice, a Scandinavian accent, and her left hand had a knife scar running sideways across all her fingers.",
            "We went to her house, and she asked me to cut up the vegetables. She got out some pans, and lit a cigarette, and made some coffee. She stood really close to me and asked me where I was from and where I was going. She wanted to know everything. And then I was peeling potatoes. She put her arms around my waist, put her head on my shoulder, and smelled my hair and my sweater.",
            "The first course was potato salad with parsley and vinegar, then sliced tomatoes with grated Parmesan, white wine, then shrimp and salmon with lemon and red wine, and then prime rib with a sweet barbecue sauce, followed by a beaker of cognac. After dinner, she showed me where I could sleep in a bedroom in the attic and said goodnight. But sometime in the middle of the night, she came into my room, naked. I opened my eyes and saw her standing there in the dark.",
            "She got into bed and whispered in German while we made love. Jenkins says, \"You made that up.\" I say, \"Maybe some of it.\"",
            "The next day, we leave base camp and walk down to a village at 12,000 feet. We buy canned sardines at the little store and spend the evening drinking its beer, lying on the grass outside, watching the old matron as she bakes bread of us in an adobe oven shaped like a beehive. As it gets dark, the light from the fire coming out the door of the oven is the only light in the village. We lie back, looking at the stars, which in the Andes, are all as bright as planets.",
            "The old woman is standing in front of the oven, staying warm, watching the bread. And my brother walks over and stands next to her. He stands there for a minute and then turns and says,",

            "\"Como?\" she says. My brother says it again, and again she says, \"Como?\" \"Huesos del condor,\" he says. \"I want to find some condor bones.\" \"No,\" she shakes her head. \"No.\"",
            "The hunt begins at dawn, my brother pulling me out of bed onto the floor. \"Come on, come on.\" I\u0027m tying my shoes, and he\u0027s out the door. Outside, the fog is lifting off the grass.",
            "I\u0027m looking for my brother, but I can\u0027t even see the car in the driveway. Then he comes running from the backyard. I run and catch up with him across the street in the Manders\u0027 backyard.",
            "And he says, \"Some animals sleep in the daytime and go out at night to eat. If we hurry, we can catch them before they go back in the ground.\" I believe him. I have no idea how he knows these things, but he does. He goes out and runs through our neighbor\u0027s yards and catches wild animals with his bare hands, mainly lizards, turtles, and snakes. Then he wraps them in his shirt and brings them back to the cages in our room so he can study them.",
            "I\u0027m running along behind him. And when I lose him in the fog, I follow the tracks he leaves in the dew on the grass. I catch up to him, and he\u0027s down on his hands and knees, crawling through the juniper bushes in front of the Gooch\u0027s house. He says, \"There\u0027s a garter snake in here. I saw it. It went right in front of me.\"",

            "We take off running. We don\u0027t need to run that far. It\u0027s not like she\u0027s going to come after us. But we keep running anyway. We jump the fence at Gerholt\u0027s house, and we\u0027re on the golf course, heading towards the gully.",

As I grew older, I pretended to be sick, so I could stay home and read the funny papers, even though the grandmother said the devil was laughing at me when I ignored the church bells that rang from six blocks away. And of course, the civil rights issues of the \u002760s suddenly made me aware that there were no black people in our church, even though we had to drive through a poor, black neighborhood to get there. [? Tuesie ?] brushed away my questions by telling me colored folks had their own way of worship, and that they wouldn\u0027t enjoy the quiet Park Place Baptist services.",

Meanwhile, my father, who thought [? Tuesie ?] was crazy as a bedbug and I was just like her, was running for school board on a platform of integration of the Beaumont, Texas, school system.

Meanwhile, my father, who thought [? Tuesie ?] was crazy as a bedbug and I was just like her, was running for school board on a platform of integration of the Beaumont, Texas, school system. He and my mother joined the Unitarian church, which, according to my grandmother, were a bunch of heathens.

As I grew older, I pretended to be sick, so I could stay home and read the funny papers, even though the grandmother said the devil was laughing at me when I ignored the church bells that rang from six blocks away. And of course, the civil rights issues of the \u002760s suddenly made me aware that there were no black people in our church, even though we had to drive through a poor, black neighborhood to get there. [? Tuesie ?] brushed away my questions by telling me colored folks had their own way of worship, and that they wouldn\u0027t enjoy the quiet Park Place Baptist services.",
