And I think that, when you want to take stake-out, and behave in your own way, and have a personality that may not be assimilated to everyone else\u0027s, it\u0027s just painful in a small town, because it sticks out."

One of the classic American stories is the migration from small town to big city, and all the personal growth, and dangers, and freedom that happen when you make that move.

The big city that her family moved to wasn\u0027t New York, or Los Angeles, or Boston. It was Bozeman, Montana, population 30,000. Which sounds like a small town to anybody who lives in a city, but it was, in fact, 30 times larger than Braggs, Oklahoma where they started."

There weren\u0027t any other Pentecostals in Bozeman, so we ended up at the most frigid, watered-down, nondenominational Protestant house of worship possible. We were used to this wrathful, angry, Old Testament Creator. And sitting through week after week of God is love got pretty bland. And after a few years, our church visits tapered off, which was fine by me. Mom, on the other hand, had to deal with not only her own loss of spiritual guidance and community, she had to sit by and watch her children losing Christian steam."

I feel really guilty and really bad that we moved to Montana, and Sarah has lost this. But over the years, as I\u0027ve seen you grow up and realize and know what kind of person you are, I\u0027m wondering, even in Oklahoma, would you have began to search in different areas and maybe doubt?"

And before I started working on this story, I\u0027d always felt badly about the way she sacrificed her happiness for mine.

Fortunately, she didn\u0027t give up, and she stayed in contact with me. So you people, you got to remember, I\u0027ve been in this thing a long time. And I guess I wouldn\u0027t say that I had given up, but I really wasn\u0027t searching that hard. And I found somebody, and it\u0027s going to result in a wedding dance April the 5, and anybody--",

I used to just really think, especially when I found out that you had lost your faith, I thought, if we would have stayed in Oklahoma, this wouldn\u0027t have happened to Sarah. I feel really guilty and really bad that we moved to Montana, and Sarah has lost this. But over the years, as I\u0027ve seen you grow up and realize and know what kind of person you are, I\u0027m wondering, even in Oklahoma, would you have began to search in different areas and maybe doubt?",
        "No, no. I\u0027m not. No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. I love you very much, and I\u0027m very proud of the person you are, and that\u0027s your choice. But it don\u0027t keep me from praying every night that you\u0027ll return to your faith, Sarah.",

She said, Momma, we understand that you\u0027re very unhappy here, and that you miss home, and if you feel that you need to go back, that\u0027s OK with Sarah and I. But we want to stay here. And I looked at you, and I said, do you want to stay here, Sarah? And you said, yes, I do.",
        "And so, I mean, I immediately wanted to burst into tears, but I thought, I need to compose myself here. And later that night, as I thought about it, I guess it was a real turning point for me, actually, to start being happy here in Bozeman. Because I thought, OK, I can\u0027t leave my children, so I better get it together.",
        "Because-- and I know you really don\u0027t like to hear me say this, Sarah-- because you and Amy have been and are the most important thing in my life. And so there\u0027s no way I could have ever gone away and left you.",
        "Oh, no. No, I could never live in Oklahoma again.",

I mean, I love my brothers back there, dearly, and my best friend, Cathy, and there\u0027s lots of wonderful people that I just adore and love so much back there, but I do feel that I\u0027ve changed so much in the 15 years that we\u0027ve lived here that I could not live in Oklahoma again.",
        "Yes, I do.",

        "She\u0027s talking about you over there?",
        "She\u0027s after Rod? That guy? She\u0027s after that guy?",
        "Tell us what she\u0027s saying.",
        "Kate snags Rod, and the two of them walk back into the gazebo. It\u0027s clear that this is only a minor glitch. The dance ends at midnight. Kate and Rod hop in a cab and head downtown. We make for the hotel. Jim offers us a ride in his van, which he bought especially for SIA events, and which feels like a huge babe trap. The van is dark red and finely upholstered. Riding shotgun is Marie.",
        "Major plans decided, the moment gets more personal. This is the time for putting on moves, to make something happen tonight.",
        "Later people, mostly men, sit around the hospitality suite. Jim pokes his head in. He grins and tells us that he\u0027s going upstairs with Marie. At 5:00 in the morning, Rod and Kate sheepishly come back from downtown. In the morning, the weekend ends with an egg and sausage breakfast, \"Amazing Grace,\" and the SIA tradition of everybody hugging everybody else in the room.",
        "Martha tells me that her favorite dance is The Waterfall. How it works is that the women form one line, the men form another, and the two meet in the middle like a zipper, couples dancing up the floor. Martha tells me she likes The Waterfall because you don\u0027t need a partner. You just stand in line, and the line moves. You pull a body close, get hugged.",
        "Everybody looks exhausted, like students after exams. Martha spends a long time crying at the window, watching the cars pull out, talking about how she already misses the hugs. She\u0027s wearing her special hugs sweatshirt, the one with the poem sewn on the front. The loop appears to be starting over. Martha\u0027s returning to her empty trailer in Indiana, where she\u0027ll be lonely, and work evenings at Kmart, and save up her money for the next SIA event. But then something happens. A man pulls a game store coin out of his pocket. He gives it to her. She reads aloud.",
        "When the two come out of the kiss, they both seem surprised. At the outset, they both expected a peck. But in the middle, something else kicked in. Something so basic, that when it hits you, you don\u0027t ask why.",
        "The next day is Friday. Half the farmers board yellow buses for the NASA Space Center. The other half trek to Houston for a World\u0027s Fair-style livestock show. About every 15 minutes, over the course of the day, somebody tries to convince me, no, this group isn\u0027t about hooking up, it\u0027s about friendship, camaraderie, everyone\u0027s one big family. But later in the afternoon, I bump into a group of SIA women who are clearly on the make. One\u0027s just bought a t-shirt that reads, cowboy butts drive me nuts.",
        "So what do you look for in the jeans, Lee\u0027s, Levi\u0027s, Wrangler\u0027s?",
        "Jim\u0027s an extreme case-- smart, charming, 52, looks 40, living on a farm outside Iona, South Dakota, population four. It\u0027s 30 miles to the nearest grocery store. The weather is so punishing, cows freeze solid standing up. His dilemma, nobody wants to move to his ranch, and he doesn\u0027t want to leave.",
        "These girls are a rowdy, hardcore bunch. They\u0027re youngish, around 30, loud, constantly making cracks. Kate, the most vocal of them, is broad and strong, a dairy cow wrangler from Wisconsin. In this crowd, she plays the tomboy. She brags about telling the men she dances with that if someone wants to pick a fight, she\u0027ll do the punching. But once alone in her hotel room, her tough girl attitude fades away.",
        "She goes on to tell me about a friend of hers, a woman who prayed every night to meet somebody and eventually did.",
        "So do you do that? Do you pray about what the kind of person--?",
        "So are you following her directions? Are you being specific?",
        "Down the hall from Kate are Ernie and Sally, a couple who met through SIA. He\u0027s 50ish, from Oklahoma, grows sesame and delivers mail. She\u0027s a school teacher from Kansas, incredibly hot, in a short, tight dress and baby-doll tee. At this point in their relationship, they only book one hotel room. And right now, Ernie is in there fixing Sally\u0027s boot. The smell of epoxy is mind-numbing. They detail their first date.",
        "OK, let me explain. Ernie had brought over a blue flapper dress. His former wife had made it. Sally wanted to look at it, maybe wear it as a costume.",
        "Was that a hard choice?",
        "Both Ernie and Sally lost their spouses. They both felt sparks five or six months ago when they first met. They live a reasonable distance apart by SIA standards, but, and this is the problem with a national organization of rural singles, the logistics make it nearly impossible to date.",
        "And how often do you get a chance to see each other?",
        "I can\u0027t believe that. Do you feel like she pushes you a little bit?",
        "Sally and Ernie have this little routine. Like most set pieces couples have, it\u0027s only half in jest. She ribs him constantly about getting married, he hedges. They love each other, but they\u0027re at different points in their lives.",
        "Ernie didn\u0027t expect to meet somebody so quickly. In fact, he wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d meet somebody at all. He married young, didn\u0027t have many girlfriends before that. Right now, this is his first round of dating. It\u0027s a heady experience, and one he\u0027s not ready to give up yet.",
        "Friday night is the second dance. And when I bump into Ernie, he\u0027s passing out these business cards. They have rainbows on them, and they read, Ernest Ernie W. Schmidt, married 32 years, widowed, I\u0027m attracted to you, let\u0027s be good friends. Sally, as you might imagine, is not so thrilled about this. She has enough good friends, at least for the time being. While Ernie mingles, we talk to her in the back room.",
        "Sally stops her interview, saying she better get back to Ernie. She\u0027s worried that he\u0027ll miss her. A moment later, we head out from the back room. I see Ernie with a blond woman, two-stepping on the dance floor. Half an hour later, we run into Ernie and Sally kissing on the veranda. Sometime after this, Sally sends me a note. On the envelope she writes, in all capitals, I WILL MARRY ERNIE SOMEDAY.",
        "The night starts winding down, at least I think it starts winding down until I realize something, nobody\u0027s planning on going to sleep. The people who come to SIA spend a lot of time alone. They crave company, affection, basic human contact. It\u0027s past midnight when the farmers leave the gazebo and return to the Flagship Hotel. Everybody\u0027s tired, but they don\u0027t go to bed. The hit the beach.",
        "Jim, the first guy I talked to back at the first dance, drags a fully clothed women into the water.",
        "This is a typical problem for people in SIA. They\u0027re all farmers, all tied to their land, though Jim\u0027s situation is particularly harsh. He tells me he realized that a few years ago when the group\u0027s director went out to visit him. Even she was stunned by how isolated he was. She said it would take a remarkable woman to move to his ranch.",
        "There\u0027s something really high school-esque about the whole SIA experience. Like right now, the moon is out, the air is salty, and we\u0027re in this huge awkward group. And what do people do to cash in on the moment? Pair off? Nope.",
        "They sing.",
        "Note, none of them has had a drop to drink.",
        "[GENERAL APPLAUSE, HOOTING]",
        "Saturday, we wake up to some incredibly tedious meetings, which, by some heroic faith, people manage to love. It completely undermines all critical standards of what\u0027s compelling, what\u0027s fun.",
        "So do you, realistically, think that you\u0027re going to get married?",
        "Later Saturday afternoon, I catch up with Martha, the woman who told me that SIA gives her reason to live. She\u0027s in her room, sewing the final beads on a sweater she\u0027s making for tonight\u0027s banquet and flag ceremony. The handiwork seems to relax her. She\u0027s got this other sweatshirt, her hug sweatshirt, that she wears at the end of every SIA retreat.",
        "Martha tells me she\u0027s a recovering alcoholic. She tells me that one of her children, her daughter, died in 1981. She works evenings at Kmart, because she can\u0027t stand to spend her nights alone.",
        "Martha goes on to tell me that before SIA events, she gets so excited that she worries that she\u0027ll have a heart attack or a stroke. People spend a lot of time getting ready for Saturday night\u0027s banquet. Women wear dresses with slits and sequins. Men wear jackets, bolo ties. This is the big event, the final showdown. The evening starts with a prayer.",
        "What\u0027s going on here is really rather incredible. There are 50 men and women lined up in long aisles by twos. Each person is bearing a flimsy, nylon handkerchief-sized flag on a long, thin pole. It would be campy if people\u0027s eyes weren\u0027t so reverent, so serious. They march towards the front of the room. After dinner, a man gives a very boring talk on Russian agriculture. Plaques are awarded to old board members. Election results are announced for the new. At the end of the banquet, Eldon, the outgoing president, gets up to make a speech. He\u0027s good-looking, jovial, in his 40s. He beats the podium nervously with his hand. A smile creeps across his face.",
        "Everybody stands up and claps and hollers for what seems like a good 10 minutes. People are so exquisitely happy, wistful, jealous, and proud. The scene feels oddly like the end of a Miss America Pageant. Women cry and clasp hands over their mouths. When the ovation fades, they gather around the bride-to-be.",
        "In the crowd, I see Martha looking overwhelmed. She embraces Eldon\u0027s fiancee.",
        "Jim\u0027s own mother even admitted that, had she known where she\u0027d been moving, she might not have married his father and moved to the land. It\u0027s Thursday night, the first night of the get-together, and we\u0027re all at a dance in a Victorian gazebo, with wood floors so old, women have been asked to wear boots, not heels. Everyone\u0027s so happy to be here. I have the sense I\u0027m talking to people who don\u0027t get to talk to other human beings enough.",
        "By tonight at the dance, any reserve the farmer\u0027s had has pretty much faded away. There\u0027s more winking, more flirting, more moving of hips, less chat about seed corn around the edges of the room. When the \"Macarena\" cues up, Jim shakes his South Dakota booty with heartbreaking deliberateness and intent. Meanwhile, Kate, the tomboy with the eye for cowboy butts, remains in the back of the room. She spent most of her evening tangling with Rod, a tall, crazy-haired rancher who apparently does not like to dance. From 10:00 to 11:00, they pull and punch each other, get to know one another\u0027s bodies by yanking skirts and stealing hats. It\u0027s classic mating, junior high style. When they head out on the veranda, my producer and I follow.",
        "So how is your night going?",
        "Any excitement?",
        "Yours.",
        "Kate\u0027s been working on Rod since early this morning. They have similar ages, energy levels, goofy karmas. While Kate\u0027s been talking to us, Rod\u0027s been leaning on the railing, a couple of yards away. Just now, though, a tall brunette walks over and starts chatting him up. Kate doesn\u0027t move. She just gets quiet, and loses interest in our interview entirely."

            "In Bozeman, I thrived, my sister blossomed, my father found his thrill, but the move was hard on my mom. She missed her epic family. The thing that made my father squirm about small town life, being surrounded by people who know you, was exactly what she\u0027d loved about it. Her family is huge and hilarious, with big mouths and bigger hearts.",
            "And up north, she missed her fiery, southern-style church. There weren\u0027t any other Pentecostals in Bozeman, so we ended up at the most frigid, watered-down, nondenominational Protestant house of worship possible. We were used to this wrathful, angry, Old Testament Creator. And sitting through week after week of God is love got pretty bland. And after a few years, our church visits tapered off, which was fine by me. Mom, on the other hand, had to deal with not only her own loss of spiritual guidance and community, she had to sit by and watch her children losing Christian steam.",
            "I hate that song more than any other. Every time it pops into my head, I shiver, because it\u0027s a spooky reminder of the docile woman I might have become had I stayed in that town, in that church, where there are so many rules and so many eyes upon you. Not to mention the fact that God himself ran the biggest stake-out of them all, and you knew that, come Judgment Day, you\u0027d account for every last slip your preacher and his minions had somehow missed.",
            "Small towns are always hotbeds of surveillance, but when you add fundamentalist religion to the mix, the things you can\u0027t do outnumber the things you can. Sex is bad. Drinking\u0027s bad. Smoking\u0027s bad. Women standing up to their husbands is bad. Questioning scripture is bad. Not attending church is bad. Cussing is pretty damn bad. And, as my father would soon find out, moving away is really, really bad.",
            "If you ask him why we left Braggs and moved to Bozeman-- and believe me, my mother\u0027s family has never stopped asking-- he\u0027ll launch into this whole song and dance about his health."

            "Yeah, what was the real reason?",
            "Why?",
            "And any other reasons? I mean, what, specifically--",
            "Dad, you\u0027re not answering the question. Tell me what you hated about Oklahoma.",
            "We were hopeful immigrants from small town Oklahoma who set out for a better life in small-town Montana and became new people. Where else but America can an okra-eating, twang-talking, God-fearing, good girl like me be given the opportunity to turn into the liquored-up, opinion-mongering heathen I am today?",
            "My dad\u0027s being diplomatic. No matter how many times I reassured him that this radio program is not on any stations in Oklahoma, and that no one in our family would listen to it if it were, he still didn\u0027t want to come right out and say why he wanted to leave Oklahoma.",
            "It was to get away from family, his and my mother\u0027s. They were nosy, and they were everywhere. Every summer, itching to get away from them and Braggs, he\u0027d drive us to the Rockies. Oh, look at the pretty mountains, Mom would say. That Old Faithful sure is something. My mother, my sister, and I just thought we were on vacation. Turns out Dad was scouting out an escape route.",
            "He still wanted to live in a small town. It\u0027s just that he wanted to live in a small town where he didn\u0027t know anyone. So he picked Bozeman. It was the right size, surrounded by gorgeous mountains, and best of all, had the vital statistics he was after-- Vowell family, 4, acquaintances 0.",
            "Arriving in Bozeman at the age of 11, I felt like we had just moved to Paris, a town of culture and ideas, of libraries, and movie theaters, and record stores. I still celebrate the first day we got there, June 5, as a birthday of sorts. Bozeman had miles and miles of cement for us to rollerskate around on, instead of the stunted 50-foot strip of sidewalk in our Braggs backyard. My sister Amy remembers pulling into town.",
            "But it was exciting, too.",
            "One of the things I liked about living in Bozeman was that there was a library. Remember in Braggs, the whole school, wasn\u0027t it like a shelf with some books on it for 12 grades of people? And Bozeman had separate buildings that were libraries, and how fun that was to just go and look at all the books we wanted.",
            "My twin sister and I were born Okies in Muskogee, because that\u0027s where the nearest hospital was. But we lived in Braggs, a dusty little Muskogee county nowhere, home to a 1,000 people, four churches, one school, a couple of stores, and a much vilified bar called The Little Oklahoma.",
            "Well, let\u0027s talk about something we generally avoid talking about.",
            "Do you think-- Well, as you know, at some point, I basically lost my faith and never got it back. Is that a regret of yours? Do you think if we had stayed in Oklahoma, I would still be right there by your side at church with you?",
            "Are you calling me a bad seed, Mom?",
            "Amy told me-- I don\u0027t remember this-- but Amy said that once, when we were about 13 or so, when we were in Bozeman, you sat us down, and you asked us if we wanted to go back to Braggs. And I would assume the reason for that is, that if we would have said yes, because you obviously wanted to go back, then we would have ganged up on dad or something. Do you remember that?",
            "Were you really? How was it for you when we said we didn\u0027t want to go back?",
            "Our mother took us to Braggs\u0027 Pentecostal church three times a week, where I got saved, got baptized, and prayed with her and the others in the ladies prayer meeting for The Little Oklahoma to be shut down. And I sang, sang in church, sang at home, sang along with my transistor radio to the Tulsa country station. I sang for God, because I knew God was listening. When I was six, I got a tape recorder for Christmas. And here\u0027s the first song I sang into it.",
            "There\u0027s so much mother-daughter history in the way my Mom says, I know you don\u0027t like hearing me say this, because she knows I don\u0027t like hearing her say that I\u0027m the most important thing in her life sometimes because of the guilt that involves. And before I started working on this story, I\u0027d always felt badly about the way she sacrificed her happiness for mine. I grew up believing she would\u0027ve been better off in her little Oklahoma hometown, surrounded by family, embraced by the church. But I found out I was wrong.",

            "Act one-- City Mouse, Country Mouse. One of the classic American stories is the migration from small town to big city, and all the personal growth, and dangers, and freedom that happen when you make that move. Our contributing editor, Sarah Vowell, went through that change yourself, with her family, but with one small catch. The big city that her family moved to wasn\u0027t New York, or Los Angeles, or Boston. It was Bozeman, Montana, population 30,000. Which sounds like a small town to anybody who lives in a city, but it was, in fact, 30 times larger than Braggs, Oklahoma where they started.",
            "Sarah Vowell\u0027s move to big-city Bozeman was so successful that she decided to repeat the experience. She move to Portland, population 500,000, Washington DC, population 600,000, San Francisco, population 700,000, and then, finally, Chicago, population 2.8 million."

I used to just really think, especially when I found out that you had lost your faith, I thought, if we would have stayed in Oklahoma, this wouldn\u0027t have happened to Sarah. I feel really guilty and really bad that we moved to Montana, and Sarah has lost this. But over the years, as I\u0027ve seen you grow up and realize and know what kind of person you are, I\u0027m wondering, even in Oklahoma, would you have began to search in different areas and maybe doubt?",
            "No, no. I\u0027m not. No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. I love you very much, and I\u0027m very proud of the person you are, and that\u0027s your choice. But it don\u0027t keep me from praying every night that you\u0027ll return to your faith, Sarah.",

She said, Momma, we understand that you\u0027re very unhappy here, and that you miss home, and if you feel that you need to go back, that\u0027s OK with Sarah and I. But we want to stay here. And I looked at you, and I said, do you want to stay here, Sarah? And you said, yes, I do.",
            "And so, I mean, I immediately wanted to burst into tears, but I thought, I need to compose myself here. And later that night, as I thought about it, I guess it was a real turning point for me, actually, to start being happy here in Bozeman. Because I thought, OK, I can\u0027t leave my children, so I better get it together.",
            "Because-- and I know you really don\u0027t like to hear me say this, Sarah-- because you and Amy have been and are the most important thing in my life. And so there\u0027s no way I could have ever gone away and left you.",
            "Oh, no. No, I could never live in Oklahoma again.",
            "I really think that I\u0027ve changed too much, Sarah. I mean, I love my brothers back there, dearly, and my best friend, Cathy, and there\u0027s lots of wonderful people that I just adore and love so much back there, but I do feel that I\u0027ve changed so much in the 15 years that we\u0027ve lived here that I could not live in Oklahoma again.",
            "Yes, I do.",
            "No, no. Growing up there, I never even dreamed in my wildest dreams about moving away from there. I just always thought, I\u0027ll just meet someone here, and get married, and live the rest of my life here.",

The big city that her family moved to wasn\u0027t New York, or Los Angeles, or Boston. It was Bozeman, Montana, population 30,000.

            "About 10:00, I sit down next to Martha, a twice-widowed woman from Indiana. She\u0027s small and nearly 60, wearing a sweatshirt she has decorated with glitter and beads. SIA is the focus of her life.",
            "She\u0027s talking about you over there?",
            "She\u0027s after Rod? That guy? She\u0027s after that guy?",
            "Tell us what she\u0027s saying.",
            "Kate snags Rod, and the two of them walk back into the gazebo. It\u0027s clear that this is only a minor glitch. The dance ends at midnight. Kate and Rod hop in a cab and head downtown. We make for the hotel. Jim offers us a ride in his van, which he bought especially for SIA events, and which feels like a huge babe trap. The van is dark red and finely upholstered. Riding shotgun is Marie.",
            "Major plans decided, the moment gets more personal. This is the time for putting on moves, to make something happen tonight.",
            "Later people, mostly men, sit around the hospitality suite. Jim pokes his head in. He grins and tells us that he\u0027s going upstairs with Marie. At 5:00 in the morning, Rod and Kate sheepishly come back from downtown. In the morning, the weekend ends with an egg and sausage breakfast, \"Amazing Grace,\" and the SIA tradition of everybody hugging everybody else in the room.",
            "Martha tells me that her favorite dance is The Waterfall. How it works is that the women form one line, the men form another, and the two meet in the middle like a zipper, couples dancing up the floor. Martha tells me she likes The Waterfall because you don\u0027t need a partner. You just stand in line, and the line moves. You pull a body close, get hugged.",
            "Everybody looks exhausted, like students after exams. Martha spends a long time crying at the window, watching the cars pull out, talking about how she already misses the hugs. She\u0027s wearing her special hugs sweatshirt, the one with the poem sewn on the front. The loop appears to be starting over. Martha\u0027s returning to her empty trailer in Indiana, where she\u0027ll be lonely, and work evenings at Kmart, and save up her money for the next SIA event. But then something happens. A man pulls a game store coin out of his pocket. He gives it to her. She reads aloud.",
            "When the two come out of the kiss, they both seem surprised. At the outset, they both expected a peck. But in the middle, something else kicked in. Something so basic, that when it hits you, you don\u0027t ask why.",
            "The next day is Friday. Half the farmers board yellow buses for the NASA Space Center. The other half trek to Houston for a World\u0027s Fair-style livestock show. About every 15 minutes, over the course of the day, somebody tries to convince me, no, this group isn\u0027t about hooking up, it\u0027s about friendship, camaraderie, everyone\u0027s one big family. But later in the afternoon, I bump into a group of SIA women who are clearly on the make. One\u0027s just bought a t-shirt that reads, cowboy butts drive me nuts.",
            "So what do you look for in the jeans, Lee\u0027s, Levi\u0027s, Wrangler\u0027s?",
            "Jim\u0027s an extreme case-- smart, charming, 52, looks 40, living on a farm outside Iona, South Dakota, population four. It\u0027s 30 miles to the nearest grocery store. The weather is so punishing, cows freeze solid standing up. His dilemma, nobody wants to move to his ranch, and he doesn\u0027t want to leave.",
            "These girls are a rowdy, hardcore bunch. They\u0027re youngish, around 30, loud, constantly making cracks. Kate, the most vocal of them, is broad and strong, a dairy cow wrangler from Wisconsin. In this crowd, she plays the tomboy. She brags about telling the men she dances with that if someone wants to pick a fight, she\u0027ll do the punching. But once alone in her hotel room, her tough girl attitude fades away.",
            "She goes on to tell me about a friend of hers, a woman who prayed every night to meet somebody and eventually did.",
            "So do you do that? Do you pray about what the kind of person--?",
            "So are you following her directions? Are you being specific?",
            "Down the hall from Kate are Ernie and Sally, a couple who met through SIA. He\u0027s 50ish, from Oklahoma, grows sesame and delivers mail. She\u0027s a school teacher from Kansas, incredibly hot, in a short, tight dress and baby-doll tee. At this point in their relationship, they only book one hotel room. And right now, Ernie is in there fixing Sally\u0027s boot. The smell of epoxy is mind-numbing. They detail their first date.",
            "OK, let me explain. Ernie had brought over a blue flapper dress. His former wife had made it. Sally wanted to look at it, maybe wear it as a costume.",
            "Was that a hard choice?",
            "Both Ernie and Sally lost their spouses. They both felt sparks five or six months ago when they first met. They live a reasonable distance apart by SIA standards, but, and this is the problem with a national organization of rural singles, the logistics make it nearly impossible to date.",
            "And how often do you get a chance to see each other?",
            "I can\u0027t believe that. Do you feel like she pushes you a little bit?",
            "Sally and Ernie have this little routine. Like most set pieces couples have, it\u0027s only half in jest. She ribs him constantly about getting married, he hedges. They love each other, but they\u0027re at different points in their lives.",
            "Ernie didn\u0027t expect to meet somebody so quickly. In fact, he wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d meet somebody at all. He married young, didn\u0027t have many girlfriends before that. Right now, this is his first round of dating. It\u0027s a heady experience, and one he\u0027s not ready to give up yet.",
            "Friday night is the second dance. And when I bump into Ernie, he\u0027s passing out these business cards. They have rainbows on them, and they read, Ernest Ernie W. Schmidt, married 32 years, widowed, I\u0027m attracted to you, let\u0027s be good friends. Sally, as you might imagine, is not so thrilled about this. She has enough good friends, at least for the time being. While Ernie mingles, we talk to her in the back room.",
            "Sally stops her interview, saying she better get back to Ernie. She\u0027s worried that he\u0027ll miss her. A moment later, we head out from the back room. I see Ernie with a blond woman, two-stepping on the dance floor. Half an hour later, we run into Ernie and Sally kissing on the veranda. Sometime after this, Sally sends me a note. On the envelope she writes, in all capitals, I WILL MARRY ERNIE SOMEDAY.",
            "The night starts winding down, at least I think it starts winding down until I realize something, nobody\u0027s planning on going to sleep. The people who come to SIA spend a lot of time alone. They crave company, affection, basic human contact. It\u0027s past midnight when the farmers leave the gazebo and return to the Flagship Hotel. Everybody\u0027s tired, but they don\u0027t go to bed. The hit the beach.",
            "Jim, the first guy I talked to back at the first dance, drags a fully clothed women into the water.",
            "This is a typical problem for people in SIA. They\u0027re all farmers, all tied to their land, though Jim\u0027s situation is particularly harsh. He tells me he realized that a few years ago when the group\u0027s director went out to visit him. Even she was stunned by how isolated he was. She said it would take a remarkable woman to move to his ranch.",
            "There\u0027s something really high school-esque about the whole SIA experience. Like right now, the moon is out, the air is salty, and we\u0027re in this huge awkward group. And what do people do to cash in on the moment? Pair off? Nope.",
            "They sing.",
            "Note, none of them has had a drop to drink.",
            "[GENERAL APPLAUSE, HOOTING]",
            "Saturday, we wake up to some incredibly tedious meetings, which, by some heroic faith, people manage to love. It completely undermines all critical standards of what\u0027s compelling, what\u0027s fun.",
            "So do you, realistically, think that you\u0027re going to get married?",
            "Later Saturday afternoon, I catch up with Martha, the woman who told me that SIA gives her reason to live. She\u0027s in her room, sewing the final beads on a sweater she\u0027s making for tonight\u0027s banquet and flag ceremony. The handiwork seems to relax her. She\u0027s got this other sweatshirt, her hug sweatshirt, that she wears at the end of every SIA retreat.",
            "Martha tells me she\u0027s a recovering alcoholic. She tells me that one of her children, her daughter, died in 1981. She works evenings at Kmart, because she can\u0027t stand to spend her nights alone.",
            "Martha goes on to tell me that before SIA events, she gets so excited that she worries that she\u0027ll have a heart attack or a stroke. People spend a lot of time getting ready for Saturday night\u0027s banquet. Women wear dresses with slits and sequins. Men wear jackets, bolo ties. This is the big event, the final showdown. The evening starts with a prayer.",
            "What\u0027s going on here is really rather incredible. There are 50 men and women lined up in long aisles by twos. Each person is bearing a flimsy, nylon handkerchief-sized flag on a long, thin pole. It would be campy if people\u0027s eyes weren\u0027t so reverent, so serious. They march towards the front of the room. After dinner, a man gives a very boring talk on Russian agriculture. Plaques are awarded to old board members. Election results are announced for the new. At the end of the banquet, Eldon, the outgoing president, gets up to make a speech. He\u0027s good-looking, jovial, in his 40s. He beats the podium nervously with his hand. A smile creeps across his face.",
            "Everybody stands up and claps and hollers for what seems like a good 10 minutes. People are so exquisitely happy, wistful, jealous, and proud. The scene feels oddly like the end of a Miss America Pageant. Women cry and clasp hands over their mouths. When the ovation fades, they gather around the bride-to-be.",
            "In the crowd, I see Martha looking overwhelmed. She embraces Eldon\u0027s fiancee.",
            "Jim\u0027s own mother even admitted that, had she known where she\u0027d been moving, she might not have married his father and moved to the land. It\u0027s Thursday night, the first night of the get-together, and we\u0027re all at a dance in a Victorian gazebo, with wood floors so old, women have been asked to wear boots, not heels. Everyone\u0027s so happy to be here. I have the sense I\u0027m talking to people who don\u0027t get to talk to other human beings enough.",
            "By tonight at the dance, any reserve the farmer\u0027s had has pretty much faded away. There\u0027s more winking, more flirting, more moving of hips, less chat about seed corn around the edges of the room. When the \"Macarena\" cues up, Jim shakes his South Dakota booty with heartbreaking deliberateness and intent. Meanwhile, Kate, the tomboy with the eye for cowboy butts, remains in the back of the room. She spent most of her evening tangling with Rod, a tall, crazy-haired rancher who apparently does not like to dance. From 10:00 to 11:00, they pull and punch each other, get to know one another\u0027s bodies by yanking skirts and stealing hats. It\u0027s classic mating, junior high style. When they head out on the veranda, my producer and I follow.",
            "So how is your night going?",
            "Any excitement?",
            "Yours.",
            "Kate\u0027s been working on Rod since early this morning. They have similar ages, energy levels, goofy karmas. While Kate\u0027s been talking to us, Rod\u0027s been leaning on the railing, a couple of yards away. Just now, though, a tall brunette walks over and starts chatting him up. Kate doesn\u0027t move. She just gets quiet, and loses interest in our interview entirely."

            "Act Three, Small town in the big city. The fact is a small town can be anywhere, even in the heart of what many people see as one of the harshest urban environments in the country. Paul Johnson, Carlos Appleby, and Sanantonio Brooks are teenagers living in public housing on Chicago\u0027s South Side at 4120 South Prairie. People who live there just call the building, 4120. It\u0027s a highrise building, 16 stories tall, 10 apartments on each floor, with an open air hallway on each floor that people who live there just call a porch. We sent them out with a tape recorder to their building to record what happens there, and then talked to them in our studios about how their building is like a small town.",
            "And is it like a real candy store? It\u0027s like somebody\u0027s apartment, they have a little fix-it-up?",
            "And you interviewed your grandmother, right?",
            "And she grew up in a small town, right?",
            "Now, Paul, you also interviewed your own mom.",
            "OK, let\u0027s hear that.",
            "Is this the way she talks all the time?",
            "Now, Carlos, you\u0027re on the second floor, right?",
            "And what\u0027s your floor like?",
            "You\u0027re living around a bunch of drug addicts and it\u0027s boring?",
            "Compare the two candy stores, 5th and the 12th, which is the better one?",
            "Let me just ask you to explain what work is?",
            "What would you guys say is the biggest problem at 4120?",
            "Yeah, for you all, anyway.",
            "Explain where the girls go.",
            "Now, do you just think it\u0027s a coincidence that girls leave? Or do you think it\u0027s one of these things where the families say, well, this building, it\u0027s kind of rough, and we don\u0027t want a girl around in this environment, we\u0027re going to take our girls out? Whereas people with boys, they just stick around.",
            "You just don\u0027t feel that the girls in the building, there aren\u0027t that many who are doing that much that\u0027s positive?",
            "If 4120 is a small town, is it one where you guys would choose to live if you had a choice?",
            "Why a basement, of all the things to name? Why a basement?",
            "If their building is, in fact, a kind of small town, then when they move away, Sanantonio, and Carlos, and Paul will probably experience what Sarah Vowell\u0027s mom experienced, what the couple I interviewed at the beginning of this program experienced when they moved away from their small towns, which is, they find they don\u0027t exactly fit into the new worlds they move to, but they no longer fit in their hometown anymore, either. As Letta Sneed, the wife of the couple at the beginning of the show said--",
            "It\u0027s like you ate from the Tree of Knowledge.",
            "Why?",
            "So what happens on the other floors? Tell me about what happens on six. What\u0027s it like?",
            "Nobody\u0027s living in any of those apartments?",
            "And why those floors?",
            "OK, now you guys should explain where we are.",
            "And is this a card game that happens all the time?",
            "Now, are these guys your age or are they older?",
            "What card game are they playing?",
            "A real candy store?",
            "Of the three of you, who\u0027s the best card player?",
            "OK, let\u0027s play a little more of the tape.",
            "Now, I\u0027ve got to say, now when you first played this tape, when you first gave this tape to producer Nancy Updike and I, we heard this and we thought, yeah, how do you lose your job on your day off? Like, what is this with these guys? But in fact, there is something else going on here, isn\u0027t there?",
            "Let\u0027s hear that scene.",
            "You guys all act out scenes from movies a lot while you\u0027re playing cards?",
            "Now, you actually tried to interview these guys while you sat there playing cards. And you tried for, like, an hour.",
            "A real candy store. There\u0027s a real candy store.",
            "You think in some ways it is like a small town?",
            "All right, run it down. Let me hear. Who and who floor, give it to me from top to bottom.",
            "And just let me be sure. When you stay on the fifth, who are you staying with?",
