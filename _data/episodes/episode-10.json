On the one hand, he proudly described himself as a family man, a church organist, in a denomination that was so strict the women covered their heads, wore no make-up, no dancing, no smoking, no drinking, no going to theaters, no swimming with members of the opposite sex, even. Her father stage-managed things so they appeared to be the perfect blond-haired, blue-eyed, American family. But secretly, he was having sex with men. By all accounts, it was lots of men. Sometimes he would even fly off to New York, go to gay clubs there."

Today\u0027s program in four acts. Act One, gay men. I talk to Susan Bergman about her father. Act Two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location about why he thinks that his children don\u0027t need to know that he\u0027s gay and why he stays married. Act Three, we take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families from the first two acts and rework them as comedy, if you can believe that. And finally, Act Four, the sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Stay with us."

You\u0027re not even sure of what you want to do. You\u0027re not sure who you want to do it with or where these people are, but you are totally consumed with that quest. Well suddenly, my wife became the person that was stopping me from pursuing what I absolutely, positively had to do to survive. And your thinking gets distorted, would be an understatement.",
        "Maybe I shouldn\u0027t say this and maybe it\u0027s unique in my situation, but you think, gee, if she had an accident or something-- yes, I knew-- it sounds bizarre. But you\u0027re almost ready to plot to kill somebody. And I\u0027ve told her this. And it\u0027s something that we-- here\u0027s a very mild mannered person, almost plotting somebody\u0027s demise, because they\u0027re stopping you. And they don\u0027t even know what\u0027s going on at this point.",
        "No, I didn\u0027t. I held it inside. You see, this was your wife. You can\u0027t do this. I\u0027m one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And you think the top of your head is going to blow off instead.",
        "She says, \"Oh, is that all?\" And I said, \"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027ve got these feelings for men and I don\u0027t know how to deal with them.\" And she says, \"Well, I married all of you. I didn\u0027t marry part of you. We\u0027ll just figure out how to deal with it.\" And so from there, we just set the guidelines that would work for us. I asked her what she needed to be comfortable? She wanted, number one, to know where I would be. And that\u0027s fine. I would sooner leave a phone number underneath the telephone, that if I don\u0027t show up by 10 o\u0027clock or 12 o\u0027clock, she calls.",
        "She wanted me to be home when the kids got home, or when the kids woke up in the morning, which is fine. The term, \"are you sleeping with somebody,\" I think, is kind of stupid. If I\u0027m going someplace to sleep, I\u0027ll sleep at home. I\u0027m going out for sex, not for sleeping. So that was never a problem. That\u0027s really the only things. And she said, \"I want to be the most important person in your life.\" And she always has been and she always will be.",
        "Because I love her and she loves me. And we\u0027re probably the best thing that happened to each other, ever. See, I don\u0027t like-- there\u0027s a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle, a dramatic difference. And I know a lot of people will disagree with this and maybe take offense at this. There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community. There is an acceptance of lying because it was needed to survive. And honesty is something that I really put a high price on and I really value it.",
        "If you want to know something, you will ask the question. If you don\u0027t ask the question, either you know the answer or you don\u0027t want to deal with the answer. Am I right?",
        "They\u0027re in their 20\u0027s. They\u0027re girls.",
        "Yes.",
        "My name is Jerry Walters.",
        "Yes. I think it\u0027s very much a conscious choice. I think that they accept me for who I am. And I don\u0027t think they want to know a whole lot more about it.",
        "I am who my children see. The only thing different about me is that I have sex with men. That is the only difference. If that makes me a different person in their eyes, what value is that? How is that going to enhance me as a father if suddenly this is in the equation too? I\u0027m a good father. I\u0027m a good husband. I take care of them. I was there when they needed things, and with school and growing up and advice and everything. And I don\u0027t think that what a person does in their bedroom, or someone else\u0027s bedroom, really is your children\u0027s concern.",
        "No. We don\u0027t depend on each other for our sexual satisfaction. I don\u0027t know if I should go into that or not. Probably not. Masturbation is something that is part of what we do for sexual satisfaction. And however you do it, it\u0027s satisfying.",
        "No. She says that\u0027s not what I\u0027m about.",
        "That was the only way that people lived. I mean anything else wasn\u0027t even considered. And so how could I be anything other than what I am? And that was to be a married man.",
        "No.",
        "In the suburbs, it\u0027s not commonplace. Let\u0027s face it. In the city it\u0027s accepted. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands, where men can show affection outwardly. You won\u0027t find that in the suburbs.",
        "It doesn\u0027t, where I live.",
        "Shall we take the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus in that context too, that your parents told you that this man is Santa Claus? Do you hate your parents or distrust your parents\u0027 judgment from that point on? When you were a child, you were given just enough information to live your life. They didn\u0027t tell you that the landlord\u0027s going to throw you out of the house. They didn\u0027t tell you that your father\u0027s going to lose his job. They didn\u0027t tell you a lot of the things that could hurt you, because they were your parents. Their job was to protect you.",
        "Jerry Walters isn\u0027t my real name. It\u0027s a name that when I used to work on a hotline, they said pick out a name that you\u0027re comfortable with and use that. And so that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been using. Plus, it separates business from my club activities. So Jerry Walters is fine.",
        "Right.",
        "Where is the lie? Was he not all of those things? Wasn\u0027t he all of those things, plus one other thing? We are complicated individuals. We can be a lot of things. You said he was a musician. He was a family man. He was a minister. He was a lot of things. And he was just this one more thing, that he didn\u0027t choose to share with her. And I think that was his privilege.",
        "I graduated. I would date occasionally. And I did find somebody that seemed like a very nice person, that we had a lot in common. And we went out on a date. But that afternoon, after I met her in the morning, and that afternoon I had my first gay experience. And so, it was really kind of a red-letter day. I went bowling with her in the evening. And I was out with another man that afternoon.",
        "So I thought well, the situation with the other man was scary and disappointing and painful, to say the least. And so I thought, well, fine. That\u0027s out of my system. I don\u0027t want any more of that."

            "There\u0027s what we wish for and there\u0027s what we get. For Susan Bergman, the story went like this. Her father led a double life. On the one hand, he proudly described himself as a family man, a church organist, in a denomination that was so strict the women covered their heads, wore no make-up, no dancing, no smoking, no drinking, no going to theaters, no swimming with members of the opposite sex, even. Her father stage-managed things so they appeared to be the perfect blond-haired, blue-eyed, American family. But secretly, he was having sex with men. By all accounts, it was lots of men. Sometimes he would even fly off to New York, go to gay clubs there.",
            "In 1983, he was one of the first victims of AIDS. They had barely named the disease. The symptoms weren\u0027t familiar. And he died before his children got the chance to ask him about who he really was and talk to him about how they should reconcile who he had pretended to be all those years, with who he was. What was real of their childhood?",
            "Susan Bergman wrote a book about her family\u0027s experience. And on her book tour, a very particular thing started to happen. Gay men, who were still married or who had been married, started to contact her. They wanted to explain her father\u0027s double life to her. They wanted to explain their own double lives to her. And they wanted to offer her the conversation that she never got to have with her father.",
            "Well, from WBEZ in Chicago, it\u0027s This American Life. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Back once again for another hour documenting life in these United States. Today\u0027s program in four acts. Act One, gay men. I talk to Susan Bergman about her father. Act Two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location about why he thinks that his children don\u0027t need to know that he\u0027s gay and why he stays married. Act Three, we take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families from the first two acts and rework them as comedy, if you can believe that. And finally, Act Four, the sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Stay with us."

On the one hand, he proudly described himself as a family man, a church organist, in a denomination that was so strict the women covered their heads, wore no make-up, no dancing, no smoking, no drinking, no going to theaters, no swimming with members of the opposite sex, even. Her father stage-managed things so they appeared to be the perfect blond-haired, blue-eyed, American family. But secretly, he was having sex with men. By all accounts, it was lots of men. Sometimes he would even fly off to New York, go to gay clubs there."

Act Two, a gay man talks to me in a parked car in an undisclosed location about why he thinks that his children don\u0027t need to know that he\u0027s gay and why he stays married. Act Three, we take all the heavy, very heavy themes about lying and families from the first two acts and rework them as comedy, if you can believe that. And finally, Act Four, the sins of the fathers pass on to the sons. Stay with us."

            "That\u0027s great. Boy, I hope I can do this without just kind of gushing all over you, because it\u0027s so great of you to call in and offer that. It\u0027s beautiful. I didn\u0027t get that chance with my father. I guess I would ask you--",
            "Oh, I think that\u0027s so great. Oh, I think that\u0027s so wonderful. I was not in touch with the full range of the reaction until after I hung up the telephone and stopped the radio interview. And clearly, that man was hurting in a lot of ways. And the last thing I needed to do was have a fight with him on the air about being a liar, or whatever. Whatever anger I would have had towards my father didn\u0027t seem to me to apply to him. He was just some innocent bystander. So I just tried to be nice. And it was kind-- oh yeah.",
            "You said, you didn\u0027t want to share your quote, \"real life,\" maybe. But why do you feel that you were forced to lie about that? How could your family have shared your life?",
            "Hm.",
            "Yeah. The most poignant letter that I got, this woman says she read the book. \"Our lives are so similar, Susan, that it was eerie for me to read.\" She talks about their background. They were all so fundamentalist. Our family wasn\u0027t quite fundamentalist. But this woman says, \"Bible believing churches that started in their living room. We had six well-behaved, talented, athletic children in our prosperous and highly visible family.\"",
            "\"When my dad was diagnosed in 1988,\" she writes, \"my mom kicked him out of the house and would have nothing else to do with him. Three of us moved him out of town, encouraged him to change his name, and lied about his mysterious disease and our parent\u0027s sudden separation. Now, they are both gone. And we are left to deal with the fraud that was our life.\"",
            "They had just buried their mother-- when she wrote me this letter-- who had died of AIDS because the father didn\u0027t protect the mother at all. She says, \"I\u0027m writing to you now, not to pour out my heart, but to ask if my sisters and I can come take you out for lunch soon there in Chicago? There are not many like us who have suffered such circumstances. And I know in my heart that I should be able to hold my head high and talk about my mother\u0027s needless death without shame. But as of now, I can\u0027t.\"",
            "That\u0027s the end of that letter. And I talked to this family at length, on several different occasions. They did come to Chicago.",
            "Yeah. Two of the daughters came. Some of the sons were not willing to even acknowledge that the parents had died of AIDS yet, one of them being a physician.",
            "I think this was a caller that was, in some ways, typical of the response that I got on talk radio.",
            "Yeah. But the interesting story that they have, as her father was dying, they spent hours and hours interviewing their father on tape about his sexual contacts. They got the names of all of the married men that he had been with in this three-city area and the addresses and the phone numbers, which he had. And they began calling those men\u0027s wives on the telephone, because they wanted to save lives, because they knew their mother was dying.",
            "Yup.",
            "Yes. I mean can you imagine that? I mean, of course they debated this among themselves. They thought this is none of our business. But when their mother got AIDS, they knew that this list of 100 married men were not taking any precautions with their own wives. And they started calling. And I said, \"Well, what was the reaction?\" I asked them to go on. And they said a lot of women hung up the phone them. And some would say, \"Oh, thank you very much for calling.\"",
            "I know but--",
            "I mean if you lose your mother to AIDS, I can see why. I never had to do that.",
            "But I\u0027ll tell you, in the town I live in, outside Chicago, there is a family, at least one, where the same thing is going on. The father is very promiscuous, a prominent man in town, has four young children. His wife has no idea he\u0027s a practicing homosexual. They have unprotected sex. And people in the community come to me and say, \"What should we do? We\u0027ve asked him to tell her. We\u0027re thinking about telling her. We want to protect her so that her kids have one parent.\" And when I talk to--",
            "I say that\u0027s their decision. They\u0027re going to have to really think about that, because I don\u0027t know the people. I can\u0027t go into their lives just because I wrote some book on some related subject. If they\u0027re involved in the family system in some way, they have to make that decision. I have no idea. But when I talk to gay men about this book, who have read it and want to have a conversation, almost everyone has said to me, \"Oh yeah, my main partners are married men.\" I said, \"Well, you have to think about your own responsibility to the family then, I imagine.\"",
            "Well, no. Because there\u0027s a lot of talk trying to defend the position that\u0027s just newly being articulated in their lives. And I understand that they\u0027re building their ramparts or whatever.",
            "Finally, I did the one right thing. I left my family and became a true homosexual. That\u0027s the right thing, that\u0027s being defended in almost all of the letters.",
            "This is a very interesting letter signed, anonymously yours. He says, \"At the risk of intrusion, which is not my intention, I\u0027m compelled to write you and express some gentle viewpoints based on experiences similar to those in your book, but admittedly little real knowledge of your life.\" I appreciated that acknowledgement very much.",
            "\"Based on your writing, however, I strongly feel that your father\u0027s life with you and your family was not the sham it may superficially appear. I see the story from a different perspective, as that of a tragic, often unconscious struggle by your father to love his family and not end up as one of nature\u0027s mistakes, which of course he wasn\u0027t. Were there no kisses of bruised knees, soothing of tears and hurt feelings, umpteen occasions of personal denial, dreams of success and happiness for you and the others? Would it be unreasonable to consider yourself doubly-loved, by a fractured psyche fighting desperately against the nature he was given? In retrospect, are not his intents as important as his failures?\"",
            "It\u0027s a beautiful letter in some ways. And in other ways, there are these irritants in these approaches. I shouldn\u0027t be so critical I suppose, but then to say to me, were there no kisses of bruised knees? Yes, of course. Yeah, I had a great Daddy in many regards. Yes, he was a split person. And I don\u0027t think that he enjoyed being split, and neither does this gentleman. But that doesn\u0027t make him a better father. And that\u0027s almost the thing that this letter is driving towards, like couldn\u0027t you be doubly loved, being loved by a homosexual father? No.",
            "I think I was well-loved by my father. I think my father was a split person, and that that destroyed him and it worked towards the destruction of his family. By coming to understand that your family was structured around a lie, that who you were told you were and that the family was, has nothing to do with what you really are or were, that\u0027s very complicated.",
            "Uh-huh.",
            "He was angry at us a lot. But it seemed like it was more-- I mean I interpreted that as we were bothering Dad, or Mom was asking too many questions. Yeah. It\u0027s not one that had occurred to me. And I would have to contest that assumption that one has to lie or one is put in a situation where lying is the only appropriate gesture or response."

            "There\u0027s the thing that you wish for and there\u0027s the thing that you get. And if what you really need is a long talk with your father, the kind of talk where you get mad and argue, and maybe he gets mad, and maybe people admit mistakes, and maybe things get resolved or maybe they don\u0027t get resolved, and you learn that they won\u0027t get resolved. But if that conversation is what you need, then no stranger on a radio call-in show, however well meaning, is going to give that to you. It\u0027s a mockery of what you need.",
            "But there you are. There you are. You\u0027re talking to this man, this stranger. And you find yourself asking a version of the question that you would most like to ask your own father. And you get an answer that is totally useless, because really it has nothing to do with you.",
            "OK, now you\u0027ve brought in some tapes of yourself being interviewed on talk radio shows that I\u0027ve got here. So this first one, do we need to explain it at all before we play it?",
            "Gay men sent Susan Bergman photos of themselves. One happy couple stands there in one of the photos in matching sweaters, raising glasses, smiling. The letter said that if her father had lived and divorced her mother, this is the kind of happiness he could have had. The letters that Susan Bergman got from the children and spouses of gay fathers, she said, seemed to be written in a completely different language than the letters she got from the gay fathers. It was like two different cultures, two different perspectives.",
            "There are lots of books about men coming out, gay men coming out, gay women coming out. But nobody seemed to be able to remember a book that had been told from the point of view of the children and the wives that these gay men had left behind. And families who are in that situation felt this shock of we are not alone. And they contacted her.",

            "They did?",

            "Why what happens? What do you start to think about?",
            "Do you think that at that time, before you told your wife, do think that in a day-to-day way, you had a lot of resentment that you would act out on, you would snap at her, that you would just be short with her? Because what you are describing is being so resentful.",
            "Finally, after two years of marriage, he got up the courage to tell his wife he wanted to have sex with men.",
            "He says, of course, he uses condoms. So he doesn\u0027t being home any infections or AIDS. His children and the people he works with don\u0027t know he\u0027s gay, though after his father died, he told his mother.",
            "The man we found to interview for this has been married for 26 years, heads a support group, called Review, for men in similar circumstances. He was willing to be interviewed, but he didn\u0027t want me coming to his home and he didn\u0027t want to come to our studios either. On the phone, I understood this to mean that he didn\u0027t feel comfortable appearing in public like this. Later, he told me that I had misunderstood, that he just didn\u0027t want to drive that far. In any case, we met in a parking lot on Damen Avenue and drove to a quiet street, where I conducted the interview, in his car.",
            "Why stay married?",
            "I suggest to him that he\u0027s the one who lies, by staying in a straight marriage, and not telling his own children he\u0027s gay. He says he\u0027s not really lying to his children. As he explains it, there\u0027s no easy time to sit your kids down and tell them that you\u0027re gay. When they\u0027re 5 or 10, it\u0027ll make no sense. When they hit adolescence, it could be confusing, a kind of burden, as they sort through their own sexual identities.",
            "If his children ask him directly he says, then he\u0027ll tell the truth. And he says, they\u0027ll ask when they\u0027re ready to hear the answer.",

            "But you\u0027re saying they accept you for who you are, but they don\u0027t actually know entirely who you are, because you keep a certain part from them.",

He feels he has to respect her wishes. I ask him if his wife is simply ashamed that other people will know her husband looks for sex outside of the marriage? No, says Jerry. She knows the marriage works for them and simply doesn\u0027t want to have to put up with the opinions of people who won\u0027t understand. And they do have a sex life, Jerry says, of a sort.",

Over time, as we talked, it became clear that this man stayed in his marriage, partly because he couldn\u0027t imagine any other life for himself. To Jerry, being an adult means having a wife, a house in the burbs, a couple kids, dinner parties, and mortgage payments, and mowing the lawn.",

            "For a while, I told him about Susan Bergman\u0027s book, about how difficult it was for her when she realized that her father wasn\u0027t what he seemed. I suggested to Jerry that his own daughters might feel betrayed, might find it hard to trust him if someday they find out he\u0027s been less than candid about his sexuality. He didn\u0027t agree.",
            "Her situation is that her father was, on the surface anyway, presented the image of being a family man, a very religious man--",
            "--was a musician in their church. And so there was this constant lie, because--",
            "How much do you need to know a person to love them, to live with them? Jerry says he talks to about 260 men a year in the support group he leads for gay and bisexual married men. He says he urges men to think very seriously about what they\u0027ll be giving up if they choose to quit their marriages, if they choose to be honest with their families, if they choose to end their double lives.",

            "This man is in his fifties, was a teenager during the Eisenhower years. He looked like any suburban dad. He was neatly dressed, in gray wool slacks, a sweater, and what appeared to be a clip-on necktie. He says he was always a good boy. He says he doesn\u0027t really get at angry people, doesn\u0027t know how to yell at people. Back in high school, he says, he was the kind of boy who\u0027d go out with girls, but never make passes at them.",
            "He went on to marry the girl, who he\u0027s still married to nearly three decades later. But soon after their wedding, he became increasingly obsessed with men. He found himself driving out to the forest preserves, where gay men were known to hang out. Men would walk over to his car. Men would try to talk to him."

            "And I would drive out of the forest preserve areas like a bat out of hell, to be perfectly honest. And thinking that, fine, I didn\u0027t do anything. So there\u0027s no reason for me to feel guilty. But I would end up with headaches that were so severe that I couldn\u0027t work. I would come home four or five days a week, and just be incapacitated with the pain. But then I was taking aspirins and Tylenol, and everything else. I got hooked on tranquilizers. And it\u0027s a scary thing.",
            "When this obsession first takes hold, where first you are thinking about it, and before you know it, you are completely consumed by the thought of doing something with another male. You\u0027re not even sure of what you want to do. You\u0027re not sure who you want to do it with or where these people are, but you are totally consumed with that quest. Well suddenly, my wife became the person that was stopping me from pursuing what I absolutely, positively had to do to survive. And your thinking gets distorted, would be an understatement.",
            "Maybe I shouldn\u0027t say this and maybe it\u0027s unique in my situation, but you think, gee, if she had an accident or something-- yes, I knew-- it sounds bizarre. But you\u0027re almost ready to plot to kill somebody. And I\u0027ve told her this. And it\u0027s something that we-- here\u0027s a very mild mannered person, almost plotting somebody\u0027s demise, because they\u0027re stopping you. And they don\u0027t even know what\u0027s going on at this point.",
            "No, I didn\u0027t. I held it inside. You see, this was your wife. You can\u0027t do this. I\u0027m one of these people that holds the door open for women and very courteous with people. So I held it inside. And you think the top of your head is going to blow off instead.",
            "She says, \"Oh, is that all?\" And I said, \"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027ve got these feelings for men and I don\u0027t know how to deal with them.\" And she says, \"Well, I married all of you. I didn\u0027t marry part of you. We\u0027ll just figure out how to deal with it.\" And so from there, we just set the guidelines that would work for us. I asked her what she needed to be comfortable? She wanted, number one, to know where I would be. And that\u0027s fine. I would sooner leave a phone number underneath the telephone, that if I don\u0027t show up by 10 o\u0027clock or 12 o\u0027clock, she calls.",
            "She wanted me to be home when the kids got home, or when the kids woke up in the morning, which is fine. The term, \"are you sleeping with somebody,\" I think, is kind of stupid. If I\u0027m going someplace to sleep, I\u0027ll sleep at home. I\u0027m going out for sex, not for sleeping. So that was never a problem. That\u0027s really the only things. And she said, \"I want to be the most important person in your life.\" And she always has been and she always will be.",
            "Because I love her and she loves me. And we\u0027re probably the best thing that happened to each other, ever. See, I don\u0027t like-- there\u0027s a difference between gay feelings and living the gay lifestyle, a dramatic difference. And I know a lot of people will disagree with this and maybe take offense at this. There is an arrested adolescence in the gay community. There is an acceptance of lying because it was needed to survive. And honesty is something that I really put a high price on and I really value it.",
            "If you want to know something, you will ask the question. If you don\u0027t ask the question, either you know the answer or you don\u0027t want to deal with the answer. Am I right?",
            "They\u0027re in their 20\u0027s. They\u0027re girls.",
            "Yes.",
            "My name is Jerry Walters.",
            "Yes. I think it\u0027s very much a conscious choice. I think that they accept me for who I am. And I don\u0027t think they want to know a whole lot more about it.",
            "I am who my children see. The only thing different about me is that I have sex with men. That is the only difference. If that makes me a different person in their eyes, what value is that? How is that going to enhance me as a father if suddenly this is in the equation too? I\u0027m a good father. I\u0027m a good husband. I take care of them. I was there when they needed things, and with school and growing up and advice and everything. And I don\u0027t think that what a person does in their bedroom, or someone else\u0027s bedroom, really is your children\u0027s concern.",
            "No. We don\u0027t depend on each other for our sexual satisfaction. I don\u0027t know if I should go into that or not. Probably not. Masturbation is something that is part of what we do for sexual satisfaction. And however you do it, it\u0027s satisfying.",
            "No. She says that\u0027s not what I\u0027m about.",
            "That was the only way that people lived. I mean anything else wasn\u0027t even considered. And so how could I be anything other than what I am? And that was to be a married man.",
            "No.",
            "In the suburbs, it\u0027s not commonplace. Let\u0027s face it. In the city it\u0027s accepted. There are areas in the city where men can hold hands, where men can show affection outwardly. You won\u0027t find that in the suburbs.",
            "It doesn\u0027t, where I live.",
            "Shall we take the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus in that context too, that your parents told you that this man is Santa Claus? Do you hate your parents or distrust your parents\u0027 judgment from that point on? When you were a child, you were given just enough information to live your life. They didn\u0027t tell you that the landlord\u0027s going to throw you out of the house. They didn\u0027t tell you that your father\u0027s going to lose his job. They didn\u0027t tell you a lot of the things that could hurt you, because they were your parents. Their job was to protect you.",
            "Jerry Walters isn\u0027t my real name. It\u0027s a name that when I used to work on a hotline, they said pick out a name that you\u0027re comfortable with and use that. And so that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been using. Plus, it separates business from my club activities. So Jerry Walters is fine.",
            "Right.",
            "Where is the lie? Was he not all of those things? Wasn\u0027t he all of those things, plus one other thing? We are complicated individuals. We can be a lot of things. You said he was a musician. He was a family man. He was a minister. He was a lot of things. And he was just this one more thing, that he didn\u0027t choose to share with her. And I think that was his privilege.",
            "I graduated. I would date occasionally. And I did find somebody that seemed like a very nice person, that we had a lot in common. And we went out on a date. But that afternoon, after I met her in the morning, and that afternoon I had my first gay experience. And so, it was really kind of a red-letter day. I went bowling with her in the evening. And I was out with another man that afternoon.",
            "So I thought well, the situation with the other man was scary and disappointing and painful, to say the least. And so I thought, well, fine. That\u0027s out of my system. I don\u0027t want any more of that."

The Neo-Futurists are a Chicago group who perform 30 plays in 60 minutes every Friday and Saturday night. And they prepared this play, they call it a play.

            "If you give me the opportunity Lord, one more time, whatever the consequence, I prayed, I will tell the truth. Judson put the question simply, the same one as before. That morning, I had sat in the sun, and read, and drunk my coffee, uninterrupted. Maybe it was a morning unlike any my father had ever been given. When Judson came home later that morning, is when he asked, \"Is there something you\u0027d like to tell me?\" There was a reason my husband was unable to retire his doubts. I had made an offer of honesty, yes, but hadn\u0027t thought the test would come so soon.",
            "Walking out on the plank of my own promise, I peered down at the water. First, you leave your father\u0027s house, and then your own. There was a deep gulf below me I could not see into. This was the last of my life, as I knew it. \"Whatever the consequence,\" I said inside my head to remind myself, breathing once. He could tell in the stillness of the pause between his question and my looking back up at him, that his life was changing too.",
            "I pretend I am a faithful wife. My husband is married to that faithful woman. The woman looks like me. She moves around in my body. This is what I mean. You can\u0027t tell by looking. He makes love to her. He has asked her a question once or twice, and she has heard herself reply with an avoidance, \"Is there anything you haven\u0027t told me? I want to know more of you, Susan.\"",

All our friends here, scrumptious food. Didn\u0027t you enjoy yourself?\" She unfastens her gold-beaded bracelet and folds it carefully into its silk-lined box, replacing the lid. \"I saw the way Tom looked at you.\" \"There\u0027s absolutely nothing for you to worry about between me and anyone here tonight. Most definitely nothing\u0027s up with Tom.\"",

            "You must understand that lying is a temporal invisibility. It\u0027s the leaves you wrap yourself in when the voice in the garden calls. I was learning to deflect any doubt or question about my faithfulness, back onto the questioner, so that I didn\u0027t have to perpetuate the lie. I had for years, part lied, but mostly told the truth. Two and more irreconcilable parts, which let me understand my father, or made me into him. Here was my father\u0027s ailment again, his dread of being known.",
            "There\u0027s a family with children on the line. I force my family to serve as the same kind of false front I was raised to be from my father. Our presence testified to his normality. We failed, no matter how we strove for blessing, to discover the root of our calamity. I can\u0027t shake his choice alone, I tell myself. So we slipped and fell, which is human. And he died, stuck. And this gluey lie I keep perpetuating, sticks to me like a curse, revisited on the next generation. My father is in the window when I glance up, and in the hurried tone of my voice, in the shape of my ribs. What if, lights on, as is, he had asked us to love him?",
            "I opened the book I had slipped into my jacket pocket and read, \"Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell on thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity; nor sworn deceitfully.\" If her hands are clean and her heart pure, I had been forgiven. But I had yet to go to the man I had wronged, and whom I desperately wanted to love me, to cancel my ongoing lie, my maintaining the family pattern of dishonesty.",
            "My husband couldn\u0027t bear ever to look at me again. Hadn\u0027t my family put him through enough already? Wasn\u0027t I a hard pill he had to swallow and swallow? He would remarry within the year, a woman of fidelity and beauty and a way with children, my children. What kinds of stories would they be told about me? All that we had made together-- I took inventory-- did not add up to the ultimate banishment of the untruthful from the presence of God."

When Judson came home later that morning, is when he asked, \"Is there something you\u0027d like to tell me?\" There was a reason my husband was unable to retire his doubts.

So we slipped and fell, which is human. And he died, stuck. And this gluey lie I keep perpetuating, sticks to me like a curse, revisited on the next generation.
